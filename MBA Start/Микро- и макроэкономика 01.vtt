WEBVTT

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.680
Ladies and gentlemen, good day.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.840
Let me introduce.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.660
I am Sergey Georgievich Searyakov,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.000
a professor of the All-Russian Academy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.220
Economic Development and Trade,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700
who has lived classes on cargo MBA

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.280
in our academy, as well as in the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.460
Academy of Economics under the Government

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.940
of the Russian Federation.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.240
We will discuss the issues

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.400
of micro- and macroeconomics.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.580
It is possible that many of you have

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.080
already faced such a science,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.420
which is called, well, it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.100
can be called differently.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.180
Most often, the economic theory, sometimes

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.360
economics, in the English-

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.280
language literature So, micro and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.640
macro economics are two components

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.600
of this science.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270
And again, if you have done this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.270
before, you know that economics

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910
theory is written in thick

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.310
textbooks, whole volumes.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.930
To recount all their content is not

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.930
possible, and you probably do not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.650
need it.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.110
So I decided on those questions

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.430
that can be interesting

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.130
and useful for you, as for people practical.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510
Therefore, I think my course is best

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.550
called economics for practitioners.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.350
They speak in the West managerial

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.210
economics or literal translation

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.310
of management economics.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.710
Please see what topics we

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
will address in this course.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.610
I would like to draw your attention that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.850
in addition to the lectures course

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030
you are offered a full printed

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570
course of lectures.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.370
It would be good to read this course.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.630
At the end of each topic you will

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.130
find a checkup.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.290
It would be good to resolve them.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.890
I recommend you pay special attention

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.010
to case studies, that is, to the analysis

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.410
of practical situations.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.230
Well, to complete this course

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.370
is probably the best solution

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.630
to a control test.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.470
I wish you success, let’s start.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.860
So look again.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.780
The first is an introduction to economics.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.580
Two questions on this topic.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.640
The first is economics as a science.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.020
Well, the introductory topic, I will stop

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.680
on it very briefly.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880
And first of all, I would like

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000
to tell you what this is for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.660
science, economy, where it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.380
came from, how it arose.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.140
It arose from such a very simple

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540
contradiction.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
People’s needs are limitless,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.300
and the resources they have

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.800
to meet these needs

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.520
are unfortunately limited.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.000
If this is the case, then there is a problem

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.620
of choice.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.100
A few basic examples.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.620
Here you come to the store.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300
No matter how rich you

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.940
are, the amount of money

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.040
you have is limited.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.540
But you will agree, you will

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.300
not buy just bread or only milk.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.060
What is your task?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.860
You need to buy some optimal

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.320
set of benefits for the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.840
limited amount of money you have.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.000
That is, the set

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.340
that best meets your

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.600
needs.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.900
That is, you solve a typical economic

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.200
problem associated with the problem

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.060
of choice.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.660
Or a firm.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.180
The company cannot produce everything.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.920
They also have limited resources.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.920
What is her task?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.940
The best way to use limited

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.060
resources is to get

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.180
maximum profit.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.500
The local authorities would like to build

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.120
a school, a road, and a hospital.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.540
Again, there are not enough resources.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.340
Again, we have to choose.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.420
So, how people, firms, society as

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.440
a whole make their choices in the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.100
context of limited resources,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.940
this is what economic theory

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.420
is dealing with.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.820
Please look at the following

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.760
slide.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.880
Object of Economy.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320
In fact, economics is studying.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.420
Here we look.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.800
Object of Economy.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.840
A decision taken in a society

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.660
when distributing limited

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.920
resources between

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.240
different uses to maximize

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.100
people’s well-being.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.960
But that’s what I’ve already told you.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.880
Economic theory is exactly what it deals

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.120
with, how people, firms, societies

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.440
as a whole make their choices in the

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.430
conditions of limited resources.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.750
Let us see further.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.250
The next slide.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.390
When you have to make a choice,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.090
you should answer three main questions.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.130
The first question.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.230
How much to produce?

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.890
The second.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.680
How to produce?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.780
The Third.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.620
For whom to produce?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.340
Again the simplest example.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.380
Local authorities.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.460
We would like to build a school, a road, a

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.020
hospital, all the resources are not enough.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.280
The first question they

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.720
have to answer.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.180
What to produce?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.180
well well.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.220
Suppose we chose the road.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.800
But immediately comes another question.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.140
The road can actually be built

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.520
differently.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.860
You can push, say, a regiment of soldiers

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.220
with the loops.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.160
You can use less manual

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.820
work and more machines.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.540
After that, what is it about?

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.880
Choosing the right production

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.320
technology.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.900
We built the road.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.640
In short, the cake is baked.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.720
What should we do next?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.700
Then we share this cake.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.940
So the question arises which?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.380
For whom to produce?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.780
In the application to the road, this

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.800
may mean this.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.640
You can make the road paid or free.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.550
If we make the road free, we answer

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.050
the question for whom to produce,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.430
for whom the road.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.770
If there is a free road, it is a

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.510
road for all who want to.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.630
If it is paid, it is already

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.550
a road for those who can

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.570
pay the required amount.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.290
Maybe a compromise option.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.290
The road can be free for residents

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.210
of our region and paid for residents

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.130
of other regions.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.700
Three main issues of economic

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700
choice.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.900
And then, see, I said before that

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.180
economic theory consists of

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.680
two parts.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.640
Microeconomics and macroeconomics.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.540
What are they studying?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.360
Look at the slide.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.260
Microeconomics studies the behavior

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.380
of individual economic agents and their

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.400
interaction in individual markets.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.340
Individual economic agents can

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.740
be, for example, a separate

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.960
firm or a separate household.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.380
And the focus of microeconomics

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.300
is on the prices and production volumes

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.940
of individual goods, the choice

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.980
of individual consumers, the

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.560
output of resources of individual

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.850
firms, and so on.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.070
Macroeconomics, in turn, studies

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.110
the economy as a whole as a

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.790
single system.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.110
And in the center of its attention

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.010
such generalizing indicators

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.070
of social production, such

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.790
as the domestic product,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.290
economic growth, unemployment,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.370
inflation, and so on.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.290
Well, let’s find out a few simple

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.710
examples.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.030
Let’s say that X has fired 100

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.850
people.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.160
What is the Economist Theory?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.600
of the microeconomy.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.400
Why is?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.570
This is because it is a matter of individual

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.290
company behavior.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.730
In Russia, the unemployment rate has declined.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:10.610
In this case, what is it about?

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.930
Economy in general.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.550
This is about macroeconomics.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:23.500
So think about it.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.940
Micro or Macro?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.280
Actually a micro.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.620
It is actually a microeconomy.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.420
Why is?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.280
Because in this case we are talking

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.000
about a market for a single product,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.980
even a very large market.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.960
Microeconomics studies individual markets,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.340
markets of individual goods.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.200
But a separate market is not necessarily

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.940
the marketplace of our village.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.020
A separate market can be the global

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.960
market, for example, the global

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.100
oil market.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.840
It is a subject of microeconomics.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.680
And a few more comments on the same subject.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.300
We should not think that

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.320
microeconomics is dealing with things

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.040
that are less important, less significant.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.000
In fact, everything big

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.340
comes from the small.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.160
It is impossible to understand how a forest

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.720
develops without knowing the laws

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.000
under which individual trees grow.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.920
And in general, look, the micro

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.000
console literally means small, but

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.040
it is not really a matter of size.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.900
The object of microeconomics may be larger

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.540
than the object of macroeconomics.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.520
The simplest example, for example,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.320
Microsoft, a separate company.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.320
Its activity relates to the course of

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.860
microeconomics, but at the same time,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.920
in terms of annual output,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.420
Microsoft exceeds the domestic

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.260
product of, for example, Luxembourg.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.680
But the Luxembourg economy is a

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.900
macroeconomy, an object of macroeconomy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.120
What is going?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.080
The object of microeconomics, I repeat,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.740
may be larger than the object

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.100
of macroeconomics.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.820
And another comment.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.260
There is no need to separate

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.820
any wall and micro and macroeconomics.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.850
In fact, they flow smoothly

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.190
into each other.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.550
Please look at

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.690
the slide.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.770
The next slide.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.270
We will talk to you about something

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.350
very important.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.190
Both economic costs.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.390
I have said that the main

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.870
problem of economic theory is the

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.610
problem of rational choice.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.630
And as soon as we make a choice,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.530
the concept of economic costs arises.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.650
This is probably the most important

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.940
concept in economics.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.000
I will stay on it in more detail.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.320
First the definition.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.960
At first glance, it may seem

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.740
difficult to you.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.620
There is actually nothing complicated.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.100
I will explain.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.140
Please look at the definition.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.440
We read.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.360
The economic costs of obtaining

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.220
a good are other goods that

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.440
could be obtained with the same

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.060
resources, but which will

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:09.520
have to be abandoned if the choice

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.980
is made in favor of

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.620
that good.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.620
I think you should be the first

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.040
to take your example.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.460
You came to study some science,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.440
say, the same economy.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.900
So tell me, please answer yourself

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.100
the question, what are your

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.420
costs of studying this

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.560
course?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.560
We are actually talking

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.720
about costs.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.560
Let me explain what your cost

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.140
of studying economics is.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.100
Well, it is likely that many

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.720
of you first remembered

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.220
the fee for training.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.940
It doesn’t really matter how much

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.060
you pay, but how much you pay.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.530
Of course, tuition is your

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.750
cost, but economists make

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.390
some adjustments.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.390
Now the annual course of study

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.770
at the Moscow University,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.270
at the Faculty of Economics,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.290
is probably about 7 thousand

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.510
units.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:38.250
At the end of the 19th century,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.270
the annual rate was about 30 rubles.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.470
It means that then it was

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.770
cheap, and now it is expensive.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.690
I hope you understand that nothing like that.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.010
So, is that what economists say?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.650
And economists say that when

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.090
you pay money for getting some

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.870
good, such as education, you

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.400
spend, you lose not that money,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.760
but what other goods you

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.540
could buy with that money.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.360
Here are those unreceived benefits and

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.980
are your losses or your costs associated

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:38.940
with receiving the

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.500
good in question.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.020
Well, for example, you could study

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.740
economics, and you could spend economics.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.840
If you study economics, you will

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.420
not be able to rest normally.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.580
This is your loss related to the

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.820
study of economics.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.700
Someone could buy a new coat

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.940
instead of studying economics.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.360


00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.540
So, the costs associated with

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.400
studying this course, the absence

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.480
of a shirt, loss or cost.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.060
well well well.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.180
What else do you lose by studying economics?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.100
In addition to paying for your studies,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.120
you are still wasting time.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.820
But again, it’s not the time

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.500
itself, but what benefits

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.580
you could acquire during

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.720
that time.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.900
What benefits are you losing?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.600
Each in different.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.080
Someone would work more,

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.360
earn more money,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.760
instead of studying.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.380
What will be included in

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.980
the cost of education?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.420
The lost salary, or rather the

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.520
benefits that could have been bought

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.320
for that salary.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680
Someone could repair an apartment

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.010
instead of studying.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.230
What will be included in the alternative

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.570
costs?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.850
It is a disappointment to

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.090
live in an unrepaired dirty apartment.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.670
Instead of learning, you

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.690
can raise a child.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.010
What is the alternative

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.550
cost of getting education?

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.190
An uneducated child.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.980
Someone could just rest.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.420
Therefore, alternative costs will be included

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.160
in education.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.360
What?

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.600
Lost pleasure of watching

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.080
your favorite series.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.740
What does it get?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.940
What to estimate alternative costs,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.180
obtaining this benefit, yes,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.600
forgot to say, alternative costs

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.840
and economic costs are

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.980
synonyms.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.520
To estimate the alternative costs

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.700
of receiving this benefit, you need to estimate

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.300
all the losses that you are incurred

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.900
in connection with this.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.300
Now, in order to bring these losses

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.220
to a single denominator, the value

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.600
of these losses would of course

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.040
be desirable to be expressed in

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.140
monetary units.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.180
Well, I would like to make a

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.960
few more comments about alternative

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.360
costs, very important, which

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.940
must be taken into account.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.540
The first observation.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.680
Alternative costs arise only

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.180
where there is an alternative.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.120
There is no alternative,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.740
no alternative or economic cost.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.340
Let us give an example.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.620
I’ve said before, we’re considering

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.200
a situation when you decide to

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.940
study a new course.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.530
During this course you should

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.950
spend money on food.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.730
Will the cost of food be included

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.850
in the alternative costs of learning

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.530
data, receiving education?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.110
No, they will not enter.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.330
And here is why.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.110
Because you have to eat

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.170
anyway, whether you

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.890
study or not.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.890
Alternative costs arise

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.910
only where there is an

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.930
alternative.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.170
If you have to bear costs regardless

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.030
of whether you are doing it

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.460
or not, then these costs are

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.260
not included in alternative

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.180
costs.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:14.730
Let us give such an example.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.750
Here is the road.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.570
It leads from point A to point B.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.710
How are two tracks.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.790
On this side the cars go from A to

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.260
B, on this side the cars obviously

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.660
go from B to A.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.100
You have to get by car from A to

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.380
B.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.320
Where will you catch the car?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.740
On which side will you stand?

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.320
Well, obviously, the elementary

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.000
life experience suggests that you

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.560
will be standing somewhere here.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.000
Explain your behavior from the perspective

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.960
of alternative cost theory.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.980
I will say immediately that the turnover from

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.760
A to B is temporary, if the car is going

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.780
this way, and you decide to become all-

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.890
yet here, the turnover will be considered

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.810
to be zero.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.610
Why are you all standing here?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.450
Let us discuss.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.110
What do you want?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.730
Obviously, you want to get from A to B

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.890
as cheaply as possible.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.010
And obviously, you think the driver

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.690
will take the smaller amount of money

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.450
from you the less it costs.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.450
Sooo with this question.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.610
What are the alternative costs

00:22:54.610 --> 00:23:00.510
of the driver to transport you, you,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.710
from A to B, if he still goes

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.260
there?

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.840
They are zero or close to zero.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.320
Why is?

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.320
Because if he still drives in this direction,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.240
then neither his time nor his gasoline

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.980
consumption will be included in the

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.100
alternative costs of transporting

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.650
you, he still drives in this

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.670
direction.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.570
There will be alternative

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.010
costs.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.750
But they are related to what?

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.050
Not wanting to have a stranger

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.870
in the room.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.210
Little you throw out.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.430
But if you are a nice lady, then,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.230
I dare assure you, there are no

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.530
costs, only benefits.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.510
Therefore, of course, the lady is most

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.210
likely to stop the car faster than the men.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.650
And look what would happen if you caught

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.170
the car standing here.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.650
The cars go from B to A, and you need from

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.550
A to B.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.690
You will deploy the car, but then

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.570
the alternative costs of the driver

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.090
will be much higher.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.370
Then the alternative costs of the

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.990
driver to transport you from A to

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.630
B, if he is driving from B to A, these

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.670
costs will include everything, and

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.630
lost time, and fuel costs, and everything.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.930


00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.630
Imagine that here at point A is

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.830
an international airport, and the

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.990
driver is going to fly out

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.110
to rest abroad.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:04.010
You are his airport and you will

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.310
be lucky in B, but you will have

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.010
to pay him a lot because his

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.610
alternative costs in this

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.030
case will be very high.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.230
We live in a world of alternatives,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.290
there are many alternatives.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.190
All alternatives cannot

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.550
be implemented at the same time.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.110
Therefore, when you assess the

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.550
alternative costs of obtaining some

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:43.430
benefit, you must choose the best

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.650
of the possible alternatives.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.370
The example.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:54.190
Let’s say that some women have

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.110
a choice for today.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.150
Today she has several

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.990
alternatives.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:10.320
Well well well.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.760
What are the alternatives for the evening?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.860
to rest.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.540
and rest.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.320
Just rest at home, watch TV.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.100
Meeting with Thomas.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.300
Meeting with Jeremy.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.420
Studying the economy.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.980
There are four alternatives.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.460
The question.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.240
What will be included in the alternative

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.360
cost of rest?

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.560
It is impossible to implement all together.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.940
You cannot meet with Thomas and Jeremiah

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.120
at the same time, and also

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.700
study economics at the same time.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.240
To estimate alternative cost

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.080
of rest, what should be considered?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.520
The value of the best of the other alternatives.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.790
Well, obviously what is it?

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.870
Studies of Economics.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.730
So, in the alternative cost of

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.820
rest will include, in this case,

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.040
the lost pleasure of studying

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.400
economics.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.890
Well, in the first approximation, I

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.590
hope that the economic or

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.470
alternative costs we have solved with you.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.250
But there is another very practical

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.450
concept, very important for practice,

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.270
the concept of non-refundable costs.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.070
Please look at the slide.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.570
After the determination of

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.650
economic costs, the determination

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.790
of non-refundable costs is given.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.410
What is written there?

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.030
Irreversible costs are costs

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.390
that have been incurred before

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.970
and cannot be reimbursed.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.840
Economists do not take this

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.400
cost into account.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.400
Let us look at the example.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.860
You are at a crossroads.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:35.820
Here is the starting point.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:43.940
You have the choice to study or not to study.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.740
To make the right choice, you need to estimate

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.140
the benefits and losses, that is,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.800
the costs you incur in connection

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.560
with the study.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.300
What benefits do you get from studying?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.120
Well, you probably expect to finish

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.680
your studies for a higher

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.380
salary or a more successful

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.640
career.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.300
Someone who likes

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.440
to learn, I’ve met too.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.820
And let’s say that the benefits of

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.720
getting education you could estimate

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.280
in rubles conditionally.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.240
Suppose you think that if you go to

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.380
study, then you will get different

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:44.560
benefits of 120 rubles.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.060
well well.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.020
But on the other hand, if you

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.280
go to study, you will suffer some

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.880
losses.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.820
What losses?

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.660
We have already talked about them.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.740
You will lose what?

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.140
The salary?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.940
Maybe maybe.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.820
You will have to pay for your studies.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.830
You can rest less.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.530
All of this is your losses, all of this is

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.090
your costs related to your studies.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.690
If you didn’t start studying, what would

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.450
you get?

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.430
You would save on the fee for study.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:37.020
You would have more rest, and so

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.320
on and so on.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.880
Let’s say that you estimate it at

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.100
100 rubles.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.960
If you go to school, how much

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.760
do you get?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.280
Profits of 120 rubles, but suffered

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.000
losses of 100 rubles.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.320
Obviously what?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.000
The benefits outweigh the costs.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.000
So it is worth starting the study.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.400
If you think rationally, of course.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.600
OK is.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.140
They started studying, paid money,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.300
just started studying, and

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.640
faced a very unpleasant surprise.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.080
Teaching worse than you expected.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.840
Which of the two numbers does this mean?

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.840
Bad study.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.320
But obviously the benefits.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.940
If you are being taught badly, what do you mean?

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:53.520
Get the benefits of education for a

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.980
smaller amount.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.500
Suppose it turned out that with

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.920
this quality of learning you If

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.260
you reason rationally, you would

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.280
not go to study.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.260
In fact, what is the point?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.060
How much benefit do you get?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.000
At 80 rubles, and lose at 100.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.160
It is not necessary to learn, obviously, but there

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.740
is a nuance.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.680
Let’s say that of these 100 rubles

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.920
of cost, 50 rubles, let’s say,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.320
it’s a tuition fee, and 50

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.520
rubles, in 50 rubles you estimate

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.140
all the other losses.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.460
And let’s say, again, that under the terms

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.420
of the contract you have money at the time

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.940
of the start of the study.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.060
What does this mean?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.660
What is when you were here at this

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.980
point, those 50 rubles you have

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.680
already paid have turned into irreversible

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.940
costs for you, which will

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.920
not be reimbursed

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.920
to you under any circumstances.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.180
Even if you continue to study, even

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.420
if you quit.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.840
What are your options now, when you

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.440
have already started studying

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.280
at this point?

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.960
Continue to study or what?

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.420
Or quit studying.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.200
Continue or quit.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.980
What do you think of when you are already

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.120
at this point?

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.980
Yes, I was fooled by promising the best knowledge.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.260
But now, if I continue studying, how

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.700
much benefit will I get?

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.040
for 80 rubles.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.180
What are my costs in connection

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.740
with continuing studies, alternative costs?

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.800
Only 50 already.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.080
That 50 rubles will not be

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.040
returned.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.620
You continue to study even if

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.340
you stop it.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.220
So what will those 50 rubles

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.940
be in?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.180
In irreversible costs.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.700
These are no longer alternative costs.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.020
At this stage, you should not take

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.240
them into account.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.640
Economists do not take into account

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.020
non-refundable costs.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.760
They look forward.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:46.450
Here is another example to make

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:50.450
it easier to understand this.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.570
You are abroad.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.870
You bought a ticket for a yacht tour.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.130
During the tour you are photographed.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.870
And it wasn’t time to end, the tour

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.090
hasn’t yet finished, as the

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.330
photos are already shown,

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.410
printed, hanging on a rope.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.230
You are not asked to take photos,

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.510
you are not forced to buy photos.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.670
You can decide whether to buy or not to buy.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.180
The photos are expensive,

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.900
$3 per piece.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.360
Well, let’s ask yourself what are

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.790
the alternative costs of a photographer

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:44.770
at the moment when all the photos

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.390
are already shown, I repeat,

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.590
printed and hanging on a rope.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.110
What are they equal?

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.130
If you think they include the cost

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.750
of the film, the cost of the photographer’

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.930
s work, then you’re wrong.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.350
Note that at the time when the photos

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:09.610
are already taken, the alternative

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.190
cost of the photographer

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.470
is zero.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.130
Why is?

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.030
Because at this point he

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:26.010
had already borne all his

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:31.890
expenses, and his expenses

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.780
became irreversible.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.840
If so, what kind of behavior

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.340
would you best choose?

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.740
Of course to negotiate.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.080
How to do it best?

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.380
You have to go to the photographer, just

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.720
take the eye in the eye and say.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.740
Here is a great job, beautiful

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.240
photos.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.760
I like these three very much.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.810
What to do?

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.470
During this tour I spent all

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.150
my money.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.210
I only have one dollar.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:31.770
You can even open your wallet

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.670
and show him that dollar.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.250
I understand that it’s not good, but

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.050
I didn’t know, dear, what could I do?

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.590
I didn’t know there would

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.730
be such great photos.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.890
I spent all my money.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.530
I only have one dollar.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.850
I like these three photos.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.090
You can put that dollar in front

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.590
of him, take pictures.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.660
He will be unhappy, but he will

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.840
not pursue you.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.420
Why is?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.640
I repeat again.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.490
What is the alternative for that moment?

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.730
What can he do with your photo?

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.130
You may be a highly respected member

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.890
of society, but you are not Julia

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.030
Roberts or Michael Jackson.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.230
So what is his alternative?

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.070
Or sell this picture?

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.130
Or just break it and throw it away?

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.750
So is his alternative cost

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.750
of using photos, in addition

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.670
to selling you, zero?

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.870
He talks about himself in Turkish,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.630
but he will say something like that.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.130
Spartish sheep, though wool and cloth.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.090
Know it in advance to make such a

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.090
fruit that you all behave like this.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.750
He’t have you photographed

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.870
at all, but when the photos

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.650
are already taken, his

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.450
alternative costs are zero.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.190
All of its costs have

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.270
become irreversible costs.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.870
You see, people in business often

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.350
catch each other on irreversible

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.430
costs.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:17.730
Most often it is not ethical, but

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.510
in this case my conscience, I

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.970
think, is absolutely pure.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.330
I did not ask him to take a photo of myself.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.910
If I had a contract with him,

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.390
I would have promised him to pay

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.990
$3 for a photo, and then, when he

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.390
had all the costs, I would have

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.610
said that I don’t have money,

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.970
here it would be probably not

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.750
ethical.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.530
But in this case I did not ask him

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.310
and I do not think I did anything wrong.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.900
Well, we looked at you, decommissioned

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.320
economic costs and non-refundable

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.540
costs.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.520
Let us summarize this first

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.460
question.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.340
What would be good

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.080
if you had a dry

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.140
rest?

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.460
What is Economics Studying?

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.080
Decisions made in society

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.700
about using limited

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.840
resources to

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.480
meet unlimited needs.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:40.600
The main problem of the economy is the

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.200
problem of choice in the context

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.320
of limited resources.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.980
When it is necessary to choose,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.620
the concept of alternative or

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.320
economic costs arises.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.220
The economic costs of receiving

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.740
a given good are those goods you

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.700
had to give up, or more precisely

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.020
the value of those goods

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.920
you had to give up if you made

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.760
a choice in favor of that

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.380
good.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.560
If all costs are already incurred,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.040
they become irreversible costs.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.520
Well, and don’t forget, of course,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.640
that economic theory consists of

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.720
two disciplines – microeconomics and macroeconomics.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.900
Well, let’s go back to the

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.620
slide “Theme Questions.”

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.260
You see, two questions.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.040
The first is economics as a science.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.960
The second is the economic cycle.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.960
Well, the first time I thought

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.000
“Hudo – poor” we watched you.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.820
The second question is very interesting,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.960
but I will leave it to you

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.920
for independent study.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.360
In the text of the lecture he has

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.080
with Russian examples.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.560
We are just a little limited

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.720
in time, we have a lot to do ahead.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:28.150
Let us move to the second topic.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.350
The second topic, please

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.490
see the slide, is called “The

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.010
Demand-Offer Model and Its

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.010
Use in Economic Analysis.”

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.860
This is a very important topic,

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.840
because the supply-demand model

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.880
is the most important, most

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.260
widely used model in the

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.520
microeconomics.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.580
It explains how prices and volumes

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.980
of goods sold and purchased

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.580
in individual markets are formed.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.320
Again, it can be a local market,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.900
a national market, and even

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.740
a world market, but a

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.140
separate good.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.820
How is the price formed?

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.500
The price, obviously, forms

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.520
depending on the supply and demand.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.760
The first question is the demand

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.120
and its factors.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.600
In the second question, we will stop with

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.000
you on the proposal.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.060
The third is market balance.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.380
We will connect supply and demand

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.400
together and see how

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.820
market price is formed.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.060
Then we can talk a little about the practical

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.240
applications of the theory.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.400
So look at.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.120
Start the first question.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.500
Demand and its factors.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.100
The definition is very simple.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.180
Please look at the slide.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.400
It is in line with the usual

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.700
logic of life.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.420
Logic to read.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.600
Demand is the amount of goods

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.120
that all buyers can and want

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.260
to purchase during a given

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:22.080
time and under certain conditions.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.680
Nothing difficult, I think there

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.240
is no.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.540
Demand is how much good we want to buy.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.880
The moment in time must be asked, the

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.720
time must be asked, and certain conditions

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.200
must be taken into account.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.180
These factors are called

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.140
demand factors.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.240
What are the main factors of demand?

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.220
Please look at the slide.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.140
The first factor is the price of this product.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.920
What is obvious.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.640
Obviously, the demand for a product

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.080
depends on its price.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.760
I think, I think everyone agrees.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.400
The second factor is the price and the

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.560
number of products.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:08.880
How to understand?

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.620
Well, let’s look at the demand, let’

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.160
s say, on the giraffes.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.160
What does it depend on?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.780
It depends on the price of the jigsaw.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:28.660
But it also depends on the prices of

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.360
the foreign marks of a similar class,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.740
which are substitutes for the jigguls.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.940
I hope you understand, no?

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.600
If foreign brands are cheaper, we will

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.300
most likely make a choice in favor

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.220
of foreign brands, while reducing

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.060
our demand for jigol.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.460
The third factor is the price and the quantity

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.060
of supplementary products.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.880
What products are complementary

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.020
to the giraffes?

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.960
Gasoline, service, garages, spare

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.420
parts, many things.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.700
And when I decide whether

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.800
to buy or not to buy a jigolo,

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.340
I will think about what.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.720
The price of the jiggles is undisputed, but

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.800
also about what I will cost the service

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.040
of the jiggles, that is, the price

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.900
of supplementary goods.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.440
Demand for jiggles depends, again,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.700
on the price and quantity of complementary

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.000
goods.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.220
The third factor is income and

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.700
their distribution among different

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.640
groups of consumers.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.260
But what is obvious?

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.140
If our income grows, then we will probably

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.800
not necessarily, but most likely

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.800
increase demand for jigol under

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.340
other equal conditions.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:58.250
The third factor is the consumer habits and tastes.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.030
It also has an impact on demand.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.470
The number of consumers obviously

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.370
affects demand.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.390
The more consumers live in our

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.290
city, the more demand for one

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.850
or another good in that city.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.470
The preclimate conditions.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.990
In my opinion, everyone understands that

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.310
in Africa the demand for shirt

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.310
will be small, and in the North a little more.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:22.470
Expectations of consumers.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.410
I will talk about expectations separately.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.870
So, let’s talk about the factors

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.390
of demand a little more in detail.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.550
But stop, that moment I forgot.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.590


00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.010
Please look at all the

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.210
factors of demand.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.510
How many there are there?

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.310
One, two, three, four, five,

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.070
six, seven, eight.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.010
8 factors of demand.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:50.890
And how you think, this is how you

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.670
think, what an important factor,

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.070
very important, obviously life-influencing

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.610
on demand, I will not mention.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:02.850
Which factor do I not mention?

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.350
I have not said anything about the quality

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.650
of the product.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.930
But don’t rush, don’t include quality

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.110
among the factors of demand.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.550
That’s why economists don’t do that.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.450
Because we are talking about the demand for

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.850
this product.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.810
The demand for this product

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.390
implies the demand for the goods

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.650
of this quality.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.150
The quality of the product

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.090
is initially considered.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.240
If the quality changes, we consider

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.240
it as a different product,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.640
though a very close substitute.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.560
In other words, the 10th and 12th models

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.460
in microeconomics are

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.340
considered as different goods.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.940
Moreover, even the jiggles of different

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.000
colors are also considered in the

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.920
microeconomy as different goods.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.620
Of course not?

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.860
The quality of the product is

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.840
initially determined.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.200
Therefore, it is not mentioned among the

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.580
factors of demand.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.680
Now let’s talk more specifically about the

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.820
factors of demand.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.480
The first factor, I repeat, which?

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.420
price of this product.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.120
Let’s see how the price of

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.860
this product affects demand for it.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.480
It is very easy.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.200
There is a so-called law of demand

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.420
in the microeconomy.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.640
Let’s see the next slide.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.860
Here is its formulation.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.260
The law of demand.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.820
The lower the price of the product,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.360
the more it is purchased during

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.860
the given time and under

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.700
other unchanged conditions.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.580
The law of demand is graphically reflected.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.680
Please look at the schedule, the

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.220
picture.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.960
See, on the axis X we postpone the

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.360
quantity of goods.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.200
I use an internationally accepted designation.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.740
Quantity in English means

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.880
Q.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.120
And by the axis Y we indicate,

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.040
we postpone the price of this product price.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.540
And what do we see?

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.420
Look carefully at the picture.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.380
I think it’s easy, there’s nothing here.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:43.300
The lower the price of the product, the

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.920
more what?

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.740
The size of demand for it under

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.260
other, I repeat, unchanged conditions.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.780
Only a small reservation.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.900
I have drawn the linear function.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.620
In fact, it can not necessarily

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.900
be linear.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.800
It can also be non-linear.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.740
It could be something like that, wrapped.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.880
But this does not abolish the laws

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.020
of demand.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.880
The linear function of demand is most

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.120
often used for simplification.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.700
We looked at how it affects

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.480
demand.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.880
The first factor is the price.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.860
But there are seven other factors in addition

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.140
to the price.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.580
Let us talk about them.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.740
Look at the next slide.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.860
Written by.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.040
The impact of all other factors

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.140
on demand is manifested in the shift of

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.800
the demand curve, upwards to the right when

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.760
demand increases and downwards to the left

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.580
when it decreases.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.640
Look at the schedule.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.520
Let’s say that the demand function is

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.520
initially set to D0.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.800
Imagine that consumer income

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.720
has increased.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.700
Nothing has changed anymore.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.800
What does this mean?

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:22.240
That at any possible price people

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.140
will want to buy this product more

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.540
than before.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.500
Where does the demand go?

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.920
to the right.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.960
The reverse situation.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.740
Consumer income has fallen.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.380
What will we most likely face here?

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.790
That at any possible price people

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:50.590
will want to buy this product

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.010
less than before.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:57.350
And the demand curve will move left down.

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:00.210
What was the factor?

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.110
The fourth, yes, the fourth factor.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.330
Income of consumers.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:09.390
What is the fifth factor?

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.630
Consumer habits and tastes.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.730
I think it is obvious too.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:17.810
Imagine such a situation.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.670
Russian consumers suddenly

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:26.230
also loved Estonian products.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.710
For example, the cream.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:30.430
What will this lead to?

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.790
That the demand for cream, for Estonian cream

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:38.730
will decrease, and the demand curve

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:42.590
will shift to the left.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.470
See, here is what is important to

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:45.510
keep in mind.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.070
What I am saying to you now

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.270
seems to me conceptually very simple.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.130
But it is very important to learn to

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.270
translate words into the language of graphics.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.490
So, I said, if the Russians suddenly

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.950
discovered the harmful properties of

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:05.830
Estonian cream, then the demand for

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:09.690
cream will fall, and the curve will shift

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.810
to the left.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:13.370
Well, I very hopefully, over

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:14.210
time, the Russians will all

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.370
get it out and understand that Estonian

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:18.450
cream is not so bad.

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:20.730
Moreover, it is very eaten.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.650
What will it lead to?

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.890
That the demand for cream will increase

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:27.530
again at the same price of it.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.750
So the demand curve will move to the right.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:37.730
So, we haven’t talked about expectations yet.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:41.790
What are the expectations in the microeconomy?

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.990
First, the expectations

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.730
of price changes.

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:51.530
Imagine that consumers expect that

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:56.110
in the near future the desired

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.790
product will travel.

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:01.550
What are they doing today?

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.050
Most likely, today they will

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:07.670
buy more goods, there may

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:11.090
be a high demand for goods.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.230
And demand will increase, accordingly, the

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.950
demand curve will shift to the right.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.570
If consumers have other expectations,

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.550
they expect that soon this product

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.530
will be cheaper, then why

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:24.210
buy it today?

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:27.110
Today, demand for it will decrease under

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:29.570
other equal conditions, and the demand

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.950
curve will shift to the left.

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:37.450
By the way, it is often used

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:40.030
by some companies in their

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.530
advertising strategies.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:47.050
How do you usually try to lure

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:48.730
buyers Don Stroy?

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:55.310
They usually say that today the prices are

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:58.870
the same, and from the first day

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:02.770
of the next month the apartments are rising.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.810
So what do the company

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:06.910
executives want?

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.510
They are looking to increase demand

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.730
for apartments today.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.820
Moving the demand curve to the right.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.700
well well.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.860
Let us now look at the second factor, about

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.160
which we have not talked yet.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.140
What was the second factor, if you

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.180
remember?

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.220
The second factor was the price

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.480
and the number of products.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.800
Let’s see how demand, changes

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.020
in the price of imported

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.200
cars affect demand for jigsaw.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.520
For some reason, imported

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.380
cars are expensive.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.520
Please look at the slide on the

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.720
left chart.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.780
On the left chart, the demand for imported

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.260
cars function.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.940
The initial price, say, of

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.900
cars was P1, and wanted

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:11.180
to buy Q1 cars imported.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.480
The car was priced at P2.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.400
So, they want to

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.860
buy less imported cars.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.160
The demand dropped to Q2.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.800
But as imported cars are getting

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:32.920
more expensive, it means that

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.520
consumers at any cost of cars

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.100
want to buy more than before.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.920
And the curve of demand for gypsy

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.340
has shifted, shifting to the right,

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.700
right up.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.760
Something similar, by the way, we

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.160
observed immediately after

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.940
the financial crisis of 1998.

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.270
Remember what happened then.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:02.590
The ruble has fallen sharply.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.970
As a result, the ruble prices of foreign

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.350
marks increased.

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:11.390
For many consumers, foreign marks have

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.670
become inaccessible.

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:14.770
They switched, accordingly, to

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:15.050
what?

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:16.530
In the Jigsaw.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.850
The bus temporarily solved its

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:20.990
sales problems.

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.770
Demand for jigsaw has increased.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.110
The demand for giraffes has shifted to the right.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.880
Now let’s talk about how

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.300
complementary markets interact

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.040
with each other.

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.180
In relation to cars, the complementary

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.700
product is gasoline.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.240
Suppose the cars were traveling.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.180
What will this lead to?

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.600
Well, before cars were worth,

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.260
say, the price of some car

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:58.080
was P1, bought Q1 cars.

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.460
The cars now stand P2,

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.580
buy them Q2.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.580
But by buying fewer cars, we, with

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.280
the rest equal, start to

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.240
spend, to present less demand

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.840
for gasoline.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.900
The demand for gasoline is shifting

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.820
to the left.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.040
The demand for gasoline is decreasing.

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:27.020
I think I have considered all the factors.

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.920
To conclude this question, here

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.540
is a very important comment.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.720
Look at the next slide.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.340
Economists distinguish between demand

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.160
and demand.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.760
These concepts sound very similar, but they

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.320
are different concepts.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.640
If the change in purchases of a given

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.820
product occurs under the influence of a

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:03.320
change in its own price, then they say

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:09.100
about a change in the amount of demand.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.740
In this case, the demand curve does not

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.880
shift, but we are going as if on the

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.840
demand curve.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.600
Return to the previous slide.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.760
cars and gasoline.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.680
What happened to the cars?

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.440
The cars traveled.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.580
They are now buying less.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.660
Previously, the price of P1 was purchased

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.780
Q1 cars, now the price of P2

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.680
is purchased Q2 cars.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.220
Why are less cars purchased?

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.220
Because they traveled.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.160
In this case, we say that the

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.820
demand for the car has changed.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.200
And we are going on the demand curve from below up.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.740
If the change in the purchase of goods

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.100
occurs under the influence of all other

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.320
factors, then they speak of the

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.720
change in demand itself.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:15.190
And here is already a shift in the

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:17.490
demand curve.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:19.630
Return to the previous slide.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.430
Why buy less gasoline?

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.430
They imitate the car.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:31.770
At the same price of gasoline,

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.130
they start to buy less.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.630
Here, the demand for gasoline curve goes

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:39.450
to the left, and we say that the demand

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:42.730
has decreased, namely the demand for gasoline.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.910
Not the size of demand, but the demand.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:48.550
All, the first question we have finished with you.

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:51.970
Now let’s talk about the second question.

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.590
The proposal and its factors.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.320
The definition of supply is as simple

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.300
as the definition of demand.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.720
We read.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.140
The offer is the amount of goods

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.440
that all producers can and want

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.960
to produce and sell during

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.020
a given time and under certain

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.720
conditions.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:20.900
Well, the same thing.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.040
Demand is how much they want to buy,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.960
and supply is how much they want

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.920
to produce and sell.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.520
Now the proposal factors.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.560
Let us look at them.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.620
There are a lot of them here too.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.960
The first factor is the price of this product.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.400
The second is the profitability of

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.560
goods that are competitive to this

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.220
product in production.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.700
I fear that this is not very clear,

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.320
but we will look at it on a specific example.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.220
The third factor is not better.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.440
The profitability of goods supplementing

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.700
this product in production, we will also

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.460
consider it on the example.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.960
The fourth factor is the cost of producers.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.560
The fifth factor is state taxes

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.600
and subsidies.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.220
The sixth producer.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.520
The Seventh Goal.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.400
The 8th natural condition.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.220
The ninth is the expectation of the producers.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:17.800
Well let us.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.260
We talked about the factors of

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.480
supply, now we talk about the

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.360
factors of demand.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.220
The first factor of the offer is the price

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.360
of the product.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.820
This is what economists call

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.980
the law of proposition.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.620
Here it is, on the next slide.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.620
The Law of Proposal.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.860
The higher the price of the product,

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.040
the more the producers

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.300
want to sell during this

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.060
time and under other unchanged

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.560
conditions.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.600
This law is contrary

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.840
to the law of demand.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.480
How did the law of demand sound?

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.560
The lower the price, the more they want to buy.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.220
What is the proposal law?

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.420
The higher the price, the more they want to sell.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.740
We have graphically introduced this law.

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.720
Again, we are putting X on what?

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.320
quantity of goods.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.980
But now it is no longer the size

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.720
of demand, but the size of supply.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.960
And again, the price of the goods.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.080
And what do we see?

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.560
The rising function.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:53.300
The higher the price of the goods,

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.120
the more they want to produce and

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.660
sell.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.700
Why is it so?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.940
Let us look at this on a simple

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.840
conditional example.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.600
Let us take a very conditional

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.860
example with you.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.160
There are only three oil

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.820
fields in the world.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.620
In each field, only one

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:30.340
barrel of oil can be extracted

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.900
under natural conditions.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.520
No more can.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.520
For the sake of simplicity, we introduce this.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.360
This is the simplification.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.300
But, obviously, every producer

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.220
would like to sell their oil

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.920
as expensive as possible.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.280
At least for a million dollars.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.080
Every manufacturer

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.600
has a minimum price.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.160


01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.500
If oil is cheaper than that price,

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.200
it will simply not be involved.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.920
And the differences in these minimum

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.400
prices are due to differences in

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.020
the costs of oil production at different fields.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:23.020
We have three oil fields.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.520
The first field is conditionally in

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.460
the Middle East.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.200
Suppose the minimum

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.160
price for the Arabs

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.160
is, suppose, $5 per barrel.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.420


01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.140
Minimum acceptable price for Arabs.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.480
Next, the second oil field,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.440
let’s say, is located in Siberia.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.120


01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.440
There is a higher cost of mining.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.260
And let’s say that the

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.340
minimum price for a Russian

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:04.000
firm is $10 per barrel.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.660
Once again, if the price is below

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.940
$10 a barrel, I believe that

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.120
oil production becomes

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.820
unprofitable and the Russians

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.500
stop oil production.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.500
And finally, the third field,

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.740
let us find it in Norway,

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.280
on the shelf of the North Sea.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.020
The minimum price for the

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.300
Norwegians is, say, $15

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.240
per barrel.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:34.030
Once again, I want to emphasize

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.390
that only one barrel

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.410
of oil can be extracted

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.990
at each field.

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.050
Let us now reason.

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:49.270
Suppose the price, the market price of

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:52.050
oil, the price of oil, so has fallen,

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:54.030
fell less than $5 per barrel.

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:57.570
Under $5 per barrel fell.

01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:59.430
How much oil will be produced?

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.270
Obviously, under such conditions, no

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.750
one will be involved in oil and the supply

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.230
of oil to the market will be zero.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:13.010
And if the price reaches $5 per

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:15.450
barrel, I repeat again, $5 per

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:17.490
barrel is the minimum price

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:20.230
that is suitable for

01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:21.930
the Arabs.

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:24.350
It no longer pleases anyone but

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:24.970
them.

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.210
So at $5 the price of oil

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.630
will be delivered to the

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:32.450
world market?

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.390
Only one barrel.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:36.130
well well.

01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.230
What if oil is on the way up and

01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:42.090
the price is $10 per barrel?

01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:44.990
Arabs more than the barrel

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.150
we assume to extract simply can not.

01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:50.130
Who to connect?

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.070
The Siberian?

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:53.110
The Russian company began to extract oil.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.330
$10 per barrel is the

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:57.290
price that is the minimum.

01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.190
So how much of the barrel and oil will

01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:02.610
be offered to the world market?

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.850
Two more Arabs and two more Russians.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.810
How much oil will be available

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.590
in the world market?

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:09.870
Two barrels

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:11.630
well well.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.430
And if the price reaches $15 per

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.330
barrel, who will connect?

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:19.490
The Norwegians.

01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.410
They are already harvesting.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:23.890
Three barrels in total.

01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:25.490
They are producing their barrel.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.350
And the supply of oil in the

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:28.690
world market is reaching what?

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:31.190
Three barrels

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:33.870
What will we and you get?

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:37.250
We can transfer this table, the data

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.850
of this table to the chart.

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:41.770
Here is look.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.960
By axis X, the quantity of goods, oil

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.060
in our example.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.740
by price of goods.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:04.730
So at $5 per barrel, how

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.370
much do you get?

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.970
1 barrel is placed on the market.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:14.730
At the price of 10 mines and offer

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.990
for sale 2 barrels.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:27.640
At the price of 15 they offer for sale 3 barrels.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.600
Having combined all these points, what

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.540
have we gotten?

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.680
Dependency of the amount of

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.260
oil offered on the world market

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.380
from the price of oil.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.420
What did you and I get?

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.970
The supply of oil.

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:53.090
We indicate the proposal with the

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:55.610
letter C.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:57.860
Why is?

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.280
and Sappled.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.960
Well, there is a case when, say,

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.600
you ask a bad student for an

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.660
exam, you draw him a function, you

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.640
write the letter C and you ask

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.600
him, is this a demand or this a proposal?

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:24.020
He thinks that the letter C means demand

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.140
and says it is a function of demand.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.200
And he gets two, not for ignorance of English.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.140
In English, it means

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.240
supply.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.260
And for ignoring that the demand

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.900
function simply cannot behave like this.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.320
The ascending function is the function of the offer.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.680
It is in accordance with the law of proposal.

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:50.720
The higher the price, the greater

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.440
the supply will be.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.680
So why is it still up

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.900
this function?

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.560
Because with the rise of the

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.900
price, it becomes profitable

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.820
to produce goods where the cost

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.080
of the goods is higher.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.900
Besides the price, there are many other factors.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.320
Let us talk about them.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.480
Let us see.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.820
The next slide.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.480
We read.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.720
The effect of all other factors

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.540
on supply is manifested in

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.280
the shift of the supply curve

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.200
to the right down when the

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.360
supply increases and to the left

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.840
up when it decreases.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.740
Let us try to figure it out.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.200
What does the offer increase?

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:55.860
This means that at the same price

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.920
they want to offer more goods to

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.830
sell than before.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.060
Well, let’s say, before at the price

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.280
of $10 per barrel, how much was

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.160
offered to sell?

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.080
Two barrels of oil.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.760
And now for some reason are

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.440
they selling at the same price

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.320
how much?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.720
Not two, but, suppose three.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.600
What does it get?

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.500
The proposition curve shifts to the

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:38.360
right, that is, when the proposition rises,

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.220
the proposition curve shifts

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.840
to the right down.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.800
When the offer falls, what does

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.260
it mean that the offer falls?

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.500
This means that at the same price,

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.640
the goods are offered for sale

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.160
less than before.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.420
For example, at the price

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.340
of $10 a barrel, two barrels of

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:07.960
oil were offered for sale.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.860
For some reason, only

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.800
one barrel.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840
And what will happen?

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.500
Where does the curve offer go?

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:23.910
Left and up.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.160
So again again.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.860
When the supply increases,

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.840
the supply curve moves again.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.300
Right and down.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.260
When the offer is reduced,

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.720
the offer curve moves left and

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.680
up.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.240
Let’s see now, why can

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.080
this happen?

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:52.550
There among the factors of the proposition, the

01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:55.990
fourth, in my opinion, the factor sounds like this.

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.750
Costs of producers.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.750
Let us discuss.

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:06.830
Suppose for some reason, I don’

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:10.530
t know why, the cost of all

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:13.690
three fields increased by

01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:15.710
$5 per barrel.

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:19.710
In our example, $5.

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:23.530
The next factor, the fifth, is

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.670
the fifth factor, state taxes

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:27.270
and subsidies.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:31.610
How does it affect the proposals?

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.890
In fact, taxes are different.

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.290
We will take those taxes that

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.890
increase the costs of producers.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:43.210
The taxes are the same cost.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:47.290
When we impose a tax, the costs

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.970
of producers increase by size.

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.550
Taxes and supply curve go up.

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:54.970
The offer is reduced.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.110
What is a Subsidy?

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.270
Taxation and the opposite.

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:01.810
When the state does not take money, it gives

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:03.030
it to the producers.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.410
With the donation and cost, the

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:06.690
costs are reduced.

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.570
And the wrong proposal goes where?

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:10.650
down to the amount of the grant.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.970
The natural conditions are not difficult.

01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:19.630
Let’s talk about the expectations of the manufacturers.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:24.530
The expectations of producers.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:27.890
Remember when we talked about

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.710
demand, also looking at expectations.

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:31.170
What were the expectations?

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:34.730
Expectations, changes, prices of goods.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.340
well well.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:41.180
Suppose, manufacturers all expect

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.600
their goods to travel soon.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.720
How will they act today?

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:52.120
They will probably hold the goods.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.440
Do not rush to sell.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.520
And accordingly what?

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.780
The offer will decrease and the offer

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.840
curve will go to the left.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.360
To the left, up.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.840
The simplest example.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.260
You are going to sell your apartment.

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:15.260
You expect that soon the apartments will still travel.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.480
You will not be in a hurry

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.240
to sell your apartment.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.000
If all do so, the supply of

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.760
apartments on the market will be less.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.120
On the contrary, if everyone expects that

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.220
the apartments will soon be cheaper, what

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.380
will the manufacturers try to do?

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.240
The seller will try to sell their

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.340
apartments as soon as possible.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.900
As a result, the supply of apartments

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.140
will increase.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.600
Here is such an example.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.000
Near the house where I live, from

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.120
the unforgettable times, a whole garage

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:49.920
town emerged.

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.920
There was a rumor that a new elite house

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.020
would be built in this place.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.000
What are we watching?

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.620
On each column of the advertisement I sell a garage.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.860
People expect that soon the garages will

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.700
be demolished, accordingly, they will be cheaper.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.880
They are selling their garage.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.520
The supply of garages is increasing.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.400
Now let’s look at the second and

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.820
third factors.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.360
Here you can see the profitability

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.100
of goods that are competitive data

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.260
of production trade.

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:32.260
Let’s talk about this factor.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:38.020
Imagine two products in the market,

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.420
in the food market.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.800
Carrots and, for example, potatoes.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.400
The carrot has traveled.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.700
How do you think this will affect

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.640
the potato supply?

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.180
Just look, to give the correct

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.480
answer, you need to stand in the

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.620
position of a farmer-producer.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.180
Not in the consumer’s position,

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.280
so we will not understand anything.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.580
The position of the farmer.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.500
What are farmers focusing on?

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.220
profitability of a good.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.160
The carrot travelled.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:31.220
So the profitability of carrots

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.960
for farmers increased on other

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.100
equal terms.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.640
What does the farmer answer?

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.360
They increase the supply of carrots.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.040
And in fact, before, look at the slide,

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.320
the carrots were P1 worth, the carrots

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.540
were offered on the Q1 market,

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.760
now the carrots are P2, and the carrots

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.380
are offered on the Q2 market.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.020
So, with the rise of prices, farmers

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.180
increase the supply of carrots.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.720
But the earth is limited.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.660
I started this lecture.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.720
The needs are limitless, and

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.580
the resources, including land, are limited.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.780
But the earth is limited, what does that mean?

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:19.520
If farmers offer more carrots to the

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.120
market, they take the land out

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.760
of the potato and occupy that land

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.000
with carrots.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.800
What do we mean watching?

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.060
We see that the potato

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.520
market is getting

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.600
smaller.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.240
I repeat, carrots produce

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.320
more.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.780
The soil is taken from the potato, given

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.280
under the carrots.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.340
So the soil under the potatoes

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.060
is getting smaller.

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.760
And at the same price of potatoes,

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.440
the supply of potatoes decreases.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.080
Look at Chart B, Chart B on the right.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.380
The potato supply is shifting.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.460
From S0 to S1 goes to

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.580
the left.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:17.040
To understand this better,

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.420
let’s look at another example.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.460
Think for yourself.

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:29.870
Think for yourself.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.830
Let us model this situation.

01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:38.870
Economists are traveling.

01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:43.870
What will happen to the proposal of the

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:46.450
tankers conditionally?

01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:49.830
Well, an economist is the same commodity

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:51.570
as carrots, potatoes or jiggles.

01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:55.230
So if we draw the curve proposal

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:58.130
of economists, what will we postpone

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.990
on the X axis?

01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.930
Their number.

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:05.390
And on the axis Y, the price of the economist,

01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:06.630
his salary.

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:10.370
We are seeing a rising curve.

01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.850
How much did economists cost?

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.950
by P0?

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:18.990
How many people have chosen the

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:22.130
profession of economist?

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:23.570
K0 is

01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:27.070
And the market was offered, the labour

01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.730
market, to the economists at this

01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:32.010
price, that is, at this salary.

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:34.890
Economists are traveling.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.320
The price of the economist P1.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.020
What are young people responding to?

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.780
A large number of young people, under

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.860
other equal conditions, are starting

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.780
to choose the profession of economist.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.640
And after some time, the market’s offer

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.820
of economists increases from

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.740
Q0 to Q1.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.180
This is the wrong proposal of economists.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.100
They are economists.

01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:12.970
Now let’s look at the tank market.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.840
My logic here is very simple.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.340
I come from what?

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.740
That if a young man chose the profession

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.080
of an economist, he will not go conditionally

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.740
to the tankman.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.720
Does that mean we are watching?

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.220
At the same price of the economist

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:41.800
P0, the supply of economists

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.480
on the market will be smaller than

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.480
before.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:49.860
So where will the curved offer go?

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:51.840
The left?

01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:01.330
Now let me...

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.790
This is what I suggest you to think about.

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:06.570
to think.

01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:10.310
The oil traveled.

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:15.360
What will happen to the supply

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360
of natural gas?

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.950
Think of.

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:26.350
Oil has traveled.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.760
What will it lead to?

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.400
That at higher prices of oil

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.300
it will be produced in those

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.380
fields that were previously unprofitable.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.440
Oil supply will increase.

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.000
So they are no longer economists, they

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:47.760
are oil.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.460
You see, the price of oil was

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.680
P0, conditionally $10 per barrel.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.380
It produced 2 barrels of oil.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.160
And at the price of P1 $ 15 per

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.260
barrel began to produce 3 barrels.

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:08.010
But very often, when oil is extracted,

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:10.630
natural gas is also

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:11.350
extracted.

01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.790
So what will it lead to?

01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:24.730
Will the supply of gas on the market increase?

01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:31.870
That is, look, gas is a good that

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.550
complements oil in production.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:36.550
What are we watching here?

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:41.570
Where will the gas supply

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:42.570
curve move?

01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:47.110
to the right.

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:49.870
At the same price, they will

01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.230
produce more gas simply because they

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.170
are producing more oil.

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.360
To end this question, let

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.340
us stop at this very

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.980
important moment.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.300
Remember, I told you that you should

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.620
distinguish between the concept of demand and

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.640
the amount of demand.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.700
Similarly, the concept of the offer

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.440
and the amount of the offer must be distinguished.

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:25.510
We read.

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.270
If you look at the slide, if the change

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:33.170
in sales of a given product occurs under

01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:35.550
the influence of the change in

01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:40.450
its price, then they say about the change

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:43.570
in the amount of the offer.

01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:46.950
This is the movement along the

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:48.290
proposal curve.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:50.290
Please look at.

01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:53.490
Why is oil producing more?

01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:56.690
Because oil has gone.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:02.710
Therefore, we go on the proposal

01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:05.170
curve from this point to this.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:08.630
The curve proposal does not move here.

01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:12.150
Oil increased, and the supply

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:14.910
of oil increased.

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:16.850
Read on further.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.730
If the change in the sales of goods

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:22.950
occurs under the influence of all

01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:25.890
other factors, then they say about

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:29.690
the change of their own offer.

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:32.410
And then there is a shift in the curve

01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:33.550
of the proposal.

01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:36.350
Look at the right schedule.

01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:40.350
Oil is expensive, more is being extracted.

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:41.530
Here we are going on the curve.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.850
At the same price, the gas

01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:49.290
is offered to the market.

01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:53.850
And we are seeing a shift in the

01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.390
curve of gas supply.

01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:57.350
In our example, right down.

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:01.390
The second question we have discussed with you.

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:04.830
We move to the third question.

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:06.330
The Third Question.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.750
The market balance.

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.860
What is required here?

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.400
So far, you and I have looked at the

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.800
demand and the offer in isolation from

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.460
each other.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.280
And now we have to combine

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.940
the function of supply and

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.420
demand in one picture.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.300
This is how it is done in the slide.

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.220
Two curves of demand and offer.

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.260
Let us discuss.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.920
Suppose the price was at P1 level

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.920
at the beginning.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.480
P1 is

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.420
Look what we will observe.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.360
You see, the price is high.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:06.640
At this price, the demand is small.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.400
What is it equal to the schedule?

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:11.980
Q1D

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.860
See you?

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.940
At the price of P1, the demand

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.960
value is Q1D.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.520
At such a high price, few would

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.260
like to buy this product.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.420
What do you think of the offer?

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.280
The price is high.

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:34.740
At this price, many would be happy

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.020
to produce and sell this product.

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.600
The value of the offer at the

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.940
price of P1 is Q1S.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.060
So what do we observe?

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.680
At P1 the supply

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.900
exceeds the demand.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:01.100
We are also seeing a market in the market.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:04.400
Manufacturers want to sell more

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.300
goods than consumers agree to

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.140
buy at this price.

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:16.020
In this model, we are considering

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.440
the so-called fully

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.520
competitive market.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.160
What is a completely competitive

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.600
market?

01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.740
This is a market with a lot of

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:31.080
independent sellers and buyers.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.860
No one controls the price.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.280
The price on the market is set naturally

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.320
under the influence of the demand of thousands

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.060
of buyers and the supply of hundreds

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.600
of sellers.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.280
But still at the P1 price, when

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.020
the sellers can't sell all

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:55.900
their goods, the price begins to fall.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:03.800
Let’s see now what happens if the market

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.380
price accidentally completely, suddenly

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.580
settles at the level of P2.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.280
What do we see now with the P2 price?

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.170
The price is low.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:20.870
At this price, many would be happy

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:23.250
to buy this product.

01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:26.050
And the amount of demand for

01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:30.590
the product is, look at the slide, Q2D.

01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:33.490
The price is low for manufacturers.

01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:36.350
At this price very few producers

01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:40.150
would like to produce and

01:31:40.150 --> 01:31:41.610
sell this product.

01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:44.130
That is, at the P2 price, the Q2S product will

01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:47.610
be offered to the market.

01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:50.930
What are we watching now?

01:31:51.210 --> 01:31:53.970
They want to sell, they want to,

01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:56.570
sorry, buy more goods than they want

01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:58.190
to sell.

01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:00.050
What is the name of the difference?

01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:01.490
Do you know that word?

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.820
Of course the Devi.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.760
There is a deficit in the market.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:12.780
And the price of the goods naturally begins to rise.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.880
The next step, what are we watching?

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.340
Look carefully at the slide.

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.780
There is a price P

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:29.080
with a star, where the values

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.620
of supply and demand

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.360
coincide.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:38.280
This price is called the equilibrium

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.200
price.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:45.180
P is the equilibrium price.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.280
The quantity of goods purchased

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.380
and sold at this price is

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.980
called the balance quantity.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.180
Let’s see how the balance

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:04.400
can change.

01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:09.290
The next slide we call a balance

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:12.010
shift.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.740
shift of balance.

01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:19.990
Let us reason.

01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:23.150
Suppose for some reason, people’

01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:25.590
s income may have increased.

01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:29.310
Demand for goods increased.

01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:34.260
What are we observing as a result?

01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:43.110
The demand curve moves upwards to the

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:47.730
right from position D0 to position D1.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.000
At the same time, the cost of

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.480
the manufacturer is increasing.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:55.960
What does it lead to?

01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:59.480
That the supply of goods decreases

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.540
and the curve of supply moves where?

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.860
Left up.

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.200
What are we watching?

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:12.480
The demand curve moved to the right.

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.000
The curve proposal moved to the left.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.580
And now they are crossing those

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.360
curves at another point.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.640
What is happening in this regard?

01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:28.990
The price of the goods must increase.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.300
Both factors in this case, both the increase

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.700
in demand and the decrease in supply,

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:39.160
pull the price toward the increase.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.420
The price of P1 was P0.

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.280
What happens to the equal number?

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.020
I have Q1 on the Q0 chart.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.480
The balance amount remains

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.500
the same.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.200
But it is not necessary.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.280
Imagine that the demand function

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.920
has shifted more to the right

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.440
than the supply function

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.300
to the left.

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.480
But see what will happen?

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.380
In this case, the price will be

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.820
even higher and the balance amount will increase.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.280
Imagine the reverse situation.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.200
When the price, when the curve

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.040
of supply shifted to the left stronger

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:27.380
than the curve of demand to the right,

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.080
what will we now observe?

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.040
The price will again rise even more,

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.860
but the balance amount will now decrease.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.320
The third question we have looked at.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.940
The fourth question is quite large.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.700
There are many practical applications of this theory.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:51.120
Let us briefly discuss

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.180
some of the simplest applications.

01:35:55.460 --> 01:36:00.260
In Russia, due to favorable

01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.320
weather conditions, this year

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.460
a record grain harvest was

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.620
collected.

01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:12.210
Please illustrate this situation

01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:13.610
graphically.

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.860
I am convinced that the market

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.480
for grain in our country

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.380
is very competitive.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.120
So, will it be what we have?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.760
The number of grains on the axis X, the price

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.860
on the axis Y.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:38.560
There are some functions, basic initial

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.880
functions, demand and offer,

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.480
I will designate them D0 and S0.

01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:52.670
There is a certain equilibrium price P0

01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:57.930
and a certain equilibrium quantity Q0.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.300
Now the conditions.

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.940
I will repeat it again.

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:07.200
Due to favorable weather conditions,

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:10.300
this year record grain harvests

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.060
were collected in Russia.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.200
What will change in the schedule, think.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.480
Well, in fact, if a record grain harvest

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.280
is collected, it means the market is

01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:30.260
overwhelmed with grain.

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.400
The supply of grain is increasing.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.280
And when the grain supply

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.500
increases, where does the supply

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.140
curve go?

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.300
Right down and down.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.320
Right down and down.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.620
What are we watching?

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:58.100
The price of grain is beginning to fall,

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.600
and it will be sold more on the market.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.880
Note that in this case, for

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.300
now only the supply curve

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.540
is shifted, but not the demand

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.460
curve.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:13.840
Because no factors affecting

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.660
demand have changed here.

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.480
Just the market is overwhelmed with grain,

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.080
grain more, grain price falls, and grain

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.220
is buying more, but we go here.

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.040
The supply curve moves, the demand

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.920
curve does not move, we go along

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.660
the demand curve.

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.180
Due to the price decline, consumers

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:35.660
are buying more grain.

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.000
Continue to analyze the situation.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.440
Suppose that under such

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.880
conditions the Ministry of Agriculture

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.440
decides on additional

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.860
purchases of grain to the

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.660
state reserve.

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.960
What will be on schedule?

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.240
Think, it is not difficult.

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.860
Additional purchases of grain

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.020
in the state reserve.

01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:22.480
If so, who will go to the

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.360
market?

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.580
A new major buyer in the person of the Minneapolis.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.380
So what is increasing now?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.520
The grain demand and demand curve

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:42.640
shift to the right to position D1.

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.420
What does the producer

01:39:47.290 --> 01:39:49.910
of Minecraft do?

01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:54.990
It tries to keep the price

01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:58.410
below P0 to support

01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:00.170
farmers.

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.620
Another thing is that when the Ministry of

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:07.520
Agriculture actually carried out such a

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.220
policy, farmers already sold their grain

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:12.960
and he really supported the buyers with

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.200
their grain purchases.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.480
Another example.

01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:27.820
The economies of India and China are seeing

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.000
rapid growth.

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:34.520
How will this affect the global

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.020
oil market?

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.820
Well again.

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.300
Look at the global oil market.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.220
Is there anything here?

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.560
The quantity price.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:51.000
There is an initial demand for oil in the

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:51.740
world market.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.440
There is an initial oil offer.

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.720
There is a balanced price.

01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.940
There is a balanced number.

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.900
What happens next?

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:08.920
The Chinese and Indian economies are growing rapidly.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.300
How will this affect the global

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:12.160
oil market?

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.920
Well obviously.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:20.180
Fast-growing economies need

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:22.680
more oil as a necessary

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:23.980
raw material.

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:26.780
So what is happening in the global market?

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:40.010
The oil demand curve is shifting to the right.

01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.630
And we watch what?

01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:47.070
Reduction of oil.

01:41:47.970 --> 01:41:49.770
But the balance also grows.

01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.790
If the oil supply curve

01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:53.750
has such an upward tilt.

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:57.670
Another example.

01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:03.430
The price of oil has risen sharply in

01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:04.570
the world market.

01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:10.030
How will this affect the foreign exchange market

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:11.150
in Russia?

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:17.410
I would like to point out that

01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:19.650
the change in the world oil price is

01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:21.150
a subsidiary condition.

01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:24.410
We are studying the changes

01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:29.230
in the currency market in our country.

01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:34.530
What is sold and bought in the currency market?

01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:38.390
The foreign currency.

01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:41.490
For example, the US dollar.

01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:45.110
So on the axis X we will postpone

01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:46.450
the amount of dollars.

01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:51.950
The dollar is a commodity like any other.

01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:55.470
There is demand for dollars, there is its offer.

01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:58.410
So, on the axis X, the amount of dollars.

01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:08.940
The price of the dollar in rubles

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:09.960
is called.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.540
The dollar course.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:18.160
So there is something we have.

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:22.040
Initial dollar demand and

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:26.200
initial dollar supply.

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.820
Let us reason.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.660
Oil has gone?

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.400
Russia exports oil.

01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:40.070
So, the influx of foreign

01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:42.370
currency, US dollars, to the Russian

01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:46.330
market has increased.

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:47.450
What will we see?

01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:53.390
The dollar offer is increasing.

01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.850
And the curve of the dollar offer is shifting

01:43:58.270 --> 01:44:01.010
to the right.

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:09.300
What happens to the dollar?

01:44:10.690 --> 01:44:12.250
The dollar is getting cheaper.

01:44:12.810 --> 01:44:14.290
This is actually happening in Russia.

01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:18.730
Due to the large influx of dollars on the

01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:23.630
Russian market, the dollar is cheaper.

01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:26.530
And now let’s assume that the Bank

01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:28.310
of Russia, the Central Bank, does

01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:34.160
not want the dollar to cheaper.

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:34.960
What to do him?

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:40.040
He wants the dollar to remain

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.940
the same, P0.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.540
What to do with the central bank?

01:44:52.110 --> 01:44:56.250
It should increase the demand for dollars.

01:44:57.150 --> 01:45:00.390
He starts buying dollars.

01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:01.690
What are we watching?

01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:05.450
On the one hand, the supply of dollars is growing,

01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:09.130
on the other hand, the demand for dollars

01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:10.510
is growing.

01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:15.700
This could lead to the dollar

01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.400
price remaining.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.180
The dollar rate remains the same.

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.920
Or maybe it will fall a little if the

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:28.160
Central Bank’s demand increases by

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.480
a smaller amount.

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.180
Suppose it will be.

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.160
What we are actually watching now.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:38.500
And to finish this question and at the

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:44.540
same time this topic, we need to understand

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:49.740
that this model, it describes

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.480
the various market situations well.

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.920
But it is actually nothing more

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.080
than a tool like a hammer.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.480
This tool must be used.

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.400
In order to correctly predict the

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.960
consequences of the changes in

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.660
demand and supply in the real market,

01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:12.280
it is necessary to understand that

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.300
the functions of demand and

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.320
supply are not always so standard,

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.220
so classic.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.620
See what a realistic look of the proposal

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.460
function is.

01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:40.050
Demand for proposal.

01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:45.730
Sooner or later, the function

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:49.810
of the proposition moves to the vertical.

01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:51.650
See here.

01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:55.350
Remember, I assumed that we only

01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:58.550
have three oil fields in the world

01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:00.370
market.

01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:03.510
And, suppose, the price

01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:06.750
set at $15 per barrel.

01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:07.650
Remember our example?

01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:12.830
Three barrels of oil are

01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:15.370
bought and sold.

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:19.710
But the fourth field simply does

01:47:19.710 --> 01:47:20.810
not exist.

01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:27.890
So, the fourth barrel of oil

01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:30.390
just got nonewhere until new

01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:34.530
fields were opened.

01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:36.510
So what is the

01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:37.990
curve proposal?

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.750
This is such.

01:47:47.690 --> 01:47:49.150
It goes vertical.

01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:54.610
If so, what will increase

01:47:54.610 --> 01:48:00.750
demand for oil?

01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:03.670
Only the price of oil.

01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.830
The balance of oil on the global

01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:09.890
market will remain the same.

01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:11.230
Just the same.

01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:13.310
And the demand curve may not

01:48:15.190 --> 01:48:16.450
be quite standard.

01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:19.130
Well, the standard type of demand curve, here

01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:19.770
it is.

01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:28.490
And if it doesn’t give you God and I

01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:31.430
insulin too, what depends on the

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:32.290
demand for insulin?

01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:33.670
The number of patients, right?

01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:36.330
Well, the prices depend slightly,

01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.270
at least within a certain

01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:47.310
price range.

01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:52.690
And if this is the case, then the curve

01:48:52.690 --> 01:48:55.030
of demand for insulin at a certain price

01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:12.950
of insulin will not buy less, this must

01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:15.270
be taken into account.

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:17.710
This is insulin, a commodity that is

01:49:17.710 --> 01:49:18.930
not easy to replace.

01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:22.330
There is a product that is easy

01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:27.950
to replace, and it is easy to refuse.

01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:31.470
Beer of this brand.

01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:36.070
What is the role of beer demand?

01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:38.290
Not for beer at all, but

01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:40.470
for beer of this brand.

01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:42.330
Goods are easily replaced.

01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:44.990
So, with a slight increase in the

01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:48.290
price of beer for this, for this

01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:49.670
type of beer, it is for

01:49:50.630 --> 01:49:53.030
it, consumers can easily switch

01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:58.930
to another type of beer.

01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:02.790
So what is the demand function?

01:50:04.170 --> 01:50:05.250
Very sexually.

01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:07.990
This is what I repeat again

01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:09.790
to better predict the

01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:12.790
effects of the change in supply

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:18.330
and demand in the same market.

01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:22.530
We need to see what the

01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:24.570
real functions of supply

01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:28.030
and demand will look like.

01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:30.050
They are not always standard.

01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:32.210
They can be both vertical

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:34.830
and horizontal.

01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:37.890
I repeat again.

01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:41.590
More detailed theory.

01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:43.930
These are described in the text of the lectures.

01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:48.750
You can get acquainted with them.

01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:53.890
The second topic will end with you.

01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:03.950
We move on to a new topic.

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.330
Production and costs.

01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:08.550
Please see the topic

01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:10.450
slide.

01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:12.150
My first question is with you.

01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:14.390
The production function.

01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:16.350
What is it?

01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:19.290
First, the definition of production

01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:21.310
is very simple.

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.430
Production is any human

01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:25.450
activity to transform

01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:26.810
limited resources of any

01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:29.310
kind, material, labor,

01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:31.530
natural, finished products.

01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:33.210
So what is the idea?

01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:37.610
To produce something, we need resources.

01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:39.670
And the production function shows

01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:42.350
the relationship between what?

01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:44.970
Between the amount of

01:51:44.970 --> 01:51:48.310
resources used and

01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:50.510
the maximum output

01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:51.930
output volume that can

01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:55.370
be achieved provided

01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:58.470
that all available resources

01:51:58.470 --> 01:52:02.070
are used fully

01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:03.770
and most efficiently.

01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:05.990


01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:10.130
The housewife is baking cakes.

01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:14.470
Within an hour, say, she can

01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:16.850
bake, if she works normally,

01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:18.850
not unworking, but better

01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:21.850
organized her work, she can

01:52:21.850 --> 01:52:24.690
afford to bake 10 cakes.

01:52:25.410 --> 01:52:29.050
So if we indicate the quantity of

01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:31.590
the household labor by L labor, labor,

01:52:31.590 --> 01:52:35.110
and production by Q quantity,

01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:37.450
then the elementary production

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:40.470
function is like that.

01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:44.670
Q is multiplied by L.

01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:47.170
I hope you can see that this

01:52:47.170 --> 01:52:52.690
feature shows how the output varies

01:52:52.690 --> 01:52:54.710
depending on the amount of work

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:56.230
used by the housewife, provided,

01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:59.410
I repeat, that her work has

01:52:59.410 --> 01:53:00.970
been organized optimally

01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:04.030
and works with normal intensity.

01:53:05.050 --> 01:53:06.290
This is the simplest

01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:07.510
production function.

01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.970
More complex functions are used

01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.130
in economics.

01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:14.850
Here, please, the most commonly

01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:17.230
used in economic theory is

01:53:17.230 --> 01:53:21.530
the two-factor production function,

01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:23.870
which reflects the dependence

01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:26.930
of output on the amount

01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:31.110
of labour and capital used.

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:33.790
Labor is L, capital

01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:35.670
is K.

01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:38.010
Q is equal to A multiplied

01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:40.410
by K in alpha, multiplied

01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:43.270
by L in beta.

01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:47.510
So K and L is the amount

01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:49.710
of labor and capital used.

01:53:50.110 --> 01:53:52.010
I just want to clarify.

01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:55.810
We measure labor in human hours, and by

01:53:56.110 --> 01:53:59.350
capital we understand not the sum

01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:01.810
of money, we invest it in business,

01:54:01.810 --> 01:54:04.550
but what is called in the economic

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:05.970
theory physical capital, that

01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:07.950
is, the means of production,

01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:12.230
machines, machines and equipment.

01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:14.490
Thus, the amount of capital we measure

01:54:14.490 --> 01:54:17.910
usually in machine-hours.

01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:22.270
And again, alpha and beta are

01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:25.370
already known parameters.

01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:27.890
And if we know them, it is

01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:30.590
enough for us to submit the quantities

01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:32.610
of labour and capital that

01:54:32.710 --> 01:54:34.990
can change, and we can get the

01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:38.810
corresponding quantity of release.

01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:41.650
I repeat again, that is achievable

01:54:41.650 --> 01:54:45.470
on the condition that both labor

01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:52.710
and capital are used in the most rational way.

01:54:52.810 --> 01:54:57.430
What do these parameters mean?

01:54:58.370 --> 01:55:00.310
Start with the parameter A.

01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:02.830
Please imagine that the

01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:05.830
quantities of capital and labor

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:11.030
are given, and the parameter A

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:12.170
changes.

01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:14.030
What does this mean?

01:55:14.970 --> 01:55:17.990
In the same case, with the same quantities

01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:20.410
of capital and labor, we can

01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:23.710
get a larger volume of production.

01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:27.350
So, parameter A reflects the

01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:31.290
impact of technical progress on

01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.770
the production function.

01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:35.150
What do parameters A and B say?

01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:39.910
A and B are the so-called coefficients

01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:43.250
of elasticity of output on labor

01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:46.010
and capital.

01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:48.350
What does this mean?

01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:51.630
Coefficient A shows how

01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:55.050
much the output changes

01:55:55.050 --> 01:55:59.230
by 1% when the capital changes

01:55:59.230 --> 01:56:00.810
by 1%.

01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:02.930
Accordingly, coefficient B shows

01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:05.750
how many percent of the output

01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:08.090
can be changed when the

01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:16.810
change of only one percent of labor.

01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:19.090
Knowing the production function, we

01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:23.410
can measure the yield from scale.

01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:27.490
Read the definition on the next

01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:29.810
slide of scale yield.

01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:33.890
The yield of scale shows how many times

01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:39.390
the output increases with the simultaneous

01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:42.030
increase of all factors of

01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:45.210
production, that is, all

01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:47.410
resources n times.

01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:51.190
To produce something, we need resources.

01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:54.310
Let’s say we use two factors:

01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:57.630
labor and capital.

01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:03.050
Suppose we and you have doubled

01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:06.110
the amount of labor and capital,

01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:09.090
that is, built a two-fold

01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:10.750
factory.

01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:13.330
This means that we use twice

01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:14.930
as much capital, twice

01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:17.490
as much machines, and

01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:19.290
twice as much labor.

01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:24.170
What about production?

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.870
Production will grow, but not the

01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:28.270
fact that it will double.

01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:32.750
Possibly three cases.

01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:33.890
The first case.

01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:36.890
We double the number of factors

01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:40.190
and the output triples.

01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.970


01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:45.770
In this case, we say that there

01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:50.930
is an increasing return from the post office.

01:57:51.110 --> 01:57:53.790
The second case.

01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:57.590
We increase output, we increase all

01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:00.350
factors, sorry, n times, that is,

01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:01.230
labor, if capital has increased

01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:03.250
n times twice, in my example,

01:58:03.250 --> 01:58:05.590
and output increases

01:58:05.590 --> 01:58:08.230
less than n times, for example,

01:58:08.230 --> 01:58:10.310
one and a half times.

01:58:10.690 --> 01:58:13.350
Then we say that there is a decreasing

01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:16.390
return on scale.

01:58:16.650 --> 01:58:17.710
And the third case.

01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:21.090
We increased both factors, all

01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:24.550
factors increased n times twice

01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:26.790
in my example, and the output

01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:28.810
increased also n times, too

01:58:28.810 --> 01:58:29.450
twice.

01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:33.670
Then we say that there is a

01:58:33.670 --> 01:58:36.890
constant return on scale.

01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:39.290
The nature of the return on scale,

01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:42.230
it plays a very important role in

01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:45.570
determining the optimal size of the enterprise.

01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:46.830
Let me say, the giraffes.

01:58:48.230 --> 01:58:51.090
They can be collected in a small workshop.

01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:54.430
Maybe of course.

01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:57.610
The car, as a production complex,

01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.610
in terms of labor and capital, we

01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:03.490
may suppose, is a hundred times greater

01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:06.370
than such a small workshop.

01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:11.210
That is, it uses a hundred times more

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.770
of the factors of production.

01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:16.090
And the output of the car car

01:59:16.090 --> 01:59:19.030
is increased by 200 or 300 times.

01:59:19.530 --> 01:59:21.290
What does that mean?

01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:25.650
As a car, assembling cars in a large

01:59:25.650 --> 01:59:29.310
factory is more effective than in

01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:30.230
a small workshop.

01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:32.630
So if the return on scale increases,

01:59:32.630 --> 01:59:34.530
what do we have?

01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:44.230
Increase the size of the enterprise.

01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:45.110
Another example.

01:59:45.210 --> 01:59:47.490
In Soviet times, they were

01:59:47.490 --> 01:59:48.890
very interested in building

01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:50.950
giant enterprises, including

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.490
in agriculture.

01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:55.950
They built, for example, giant pig

01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:59.690
farms for thousands or even tens

01:59:59.690 --> 02:00:01.870
of thousands of cattle.

02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:04.290
Not only that the whole ecology flew within

02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:05.630
a radius of 100 kilometers.

02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:07.510
Here is what was.

02:00:08.150 --> 02:00:10.570
For example, a giant pig farm

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:14.870
uses a hundred times more factor

02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:17.430
production than a small farm.

02:00:18.690 --> 02:00:21.090
And the meat production

02:00:21.090 --> 02:00:23.310
in her is, let’s say, only ten

02:00:23.310 --> 02:00:24.270
times more.

02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:27.090
What does that mean?

02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:29.550
That large enterprises in agriculture

02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:31.950
are economically inefficient.

02:00:32.190 --> 02:00:33.750
This is why small farms

02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:36.490
are quite effective in agriculture.

02:00:36.490 --> 02:00:38.770


02:00:39.010 --> 02:00:42.890
And when we increase the size of the

02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:46.050
enterprise, we sooner or later come

02:00:46.050 --> 02:00:48.590
to a situation in which the increasing

02:00:48.590 --> 02:00:51.050
return on scale is replaced

02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:53.590
by a constant, and then decreasing.

02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:56.890
This means that it is not worth strengthening

02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:59.710
the company.

02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:03.810
It is better to enjoy a large

02:01:03.810 --> 02:01:04.910
number of, but a smaller

02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:06.530
size.

02:01:06.630 --> 02:01:10.710
Knowing the production function, we

02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:14.990
can always calculate the cost of the company.

02:01:15.170 --> 02:01:17.750
Here we move to the second question.

02:01:27.610 --> 02:01:30.590
Economists divide costs into

02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:33.090
accounting and economic.

02:01:33.190 --> 02:01:34.810
Definition of accounting costs.

02:01:34.890 --> 02:01:36.470
Please look at the slide.

02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:40.970
Accounting costs of a company are

02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:46.560
the amount of actual payments purchased

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:48.640
by resources.

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.920
Well, that is very easy.

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.370
To produce something, a company

02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:59.170
needs a variety of resources.

02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:02.790
This company purchases.

02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:06.270
A accountant then summarizes all these

02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:07.470
payments purchased by resources

02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:11.570
and enters them into its accounting

02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:13.930
report.

02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:20.510
Let us look at the simplest

02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:22.230
example.

02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:24.730
Let us look at the simplest

02:02:24.730 --> 02:02:28.330
example of accounting costs.

02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:32.630
Suppose the company uses equipment

02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:37.950
worth 200 rubles and a service

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:40.930
life, say, 5 years.

02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:43.890
The entire cost of the equipment

02:02:43.890 --> 02:02:45.950
cannot be attributed to the

02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:47.050
cost of one year.

02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:50.230
We need to use amortization.

02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:53.030
When using the simplest linear

02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:55.890
depreciation, the cost of one

02:02:55.890 --> 02:02:58.270
year will be attributed, respectively,

02:02:58.270 --> 02:03:00.750
200, divided by 5, 40

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:02.550
rubles.

02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:13.050
The accountant makes its report.

02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:16.950
The amortisation is 40 rubles.

02:03:17.050 --> 02:03:21.530
Further, let’s say, a firm uses an

02:03:21.630 --> 02:03:27.070
annual accountant writing 80 raw materials

02:03:27.070 --> 02:03:32.130
and paying a firm, let’s say, 60

02:03:32.130 --> 02:03:46.330
rubles of salary per year.

02:03:46.330 --> 02:03:52.550
The accountant says, salary 60.

02:03:52.650 --> 02:03:54.370
Now let’s say that

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:57.950
the equipment is 20 rubles.

02:03:59.430 --> 02:04:01.610
The annual loan

02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:04.390
rate is 20 rubles.

02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.550
The loan fee is 20 rubles.

02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:12.790
Suppose that no more payments are

02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:15.490
made by the company.

02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:18.590
Well, it does not incur administrative,

02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:20.730
transportation, advertising, research,

02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:23.110
does not pay taxes and is not

02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:24.490
attributable to cost.

02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:27.090
Nothing of that.

02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:30.570
The accountant summarizes all these

02:04:30.570 --> 02:04:32.230
payments and writes.

02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:38.590
The accounting costs amounted

02:04:38.590 --> 02:04:41.550
to 200 rubles.

02:04:41.650 --> 02:04:45.510
The economist has a little of his own view.

02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:54.260
Alternative costs are

02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:56.920
economic costs.

02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.220
They represent the value of

02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:03.320
the goods that could be obtained

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:08.060
by the most profitable of

02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:13.250
all alternative ways of

02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:15.930
using limited resources.

02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:18.450
I am afraid it is not very clear, but it can be easier.

02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:21.930
In practical calculations,

02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:25.650
economic costs include, in addition

02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:29.430
to the explicit or accounting

02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:33.210
costs, also the implicit

02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:35.190
costs.

02:05:35.210 --> 02:05:37.650
Can we write that economic

02:05:37.650 --> 02:05:42.550
costs are equal to what?

02:05:42.710 --> 02:05:46.050
Accounting costs plus some other

02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:48.930
unclear costs.

02:05:50.370 --> 02:05:56.750
What is accounting costs?

02:05:56.850 --> 02:05:57.850
I have already said.

02:05:59.170 --> 02:06:01.830
It is not clear what implicit costs are.

02:06:01.930 --> 02:06:02.850
We read.

02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:07.750
The implicit costs are the

02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:11.410
amount of incomes of the

02:06:11.410 --> 02:06:16.050
company on its own resources.

02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:19.910
It is about the income that the

02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:23.550
management of the company could

02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:32.590
get by using its resources not in

02:06:32.590 --> 02:06:37.170
this business, but somehow differently.

02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:39.710
Let us find out.

02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:44.880
Imagine that you have started your own

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:45.580
business.

02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:47.740
You come into this business not

02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.140
with empty hands.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:55.090
What did you bring with you?

02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:58.190
Maybe a lot of

02:06:58.190 --> 02:07:00.290
money.

02:07:01.330 --> 02:07:06.890
Let’s say 100 rubles.

02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:08.950
Could you use this

02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:11.890
capital as an alternative?

02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:16.490
Of course could.

02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:18.490
What is the easiest way

02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:19.550
to use that money?

02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:24.150
You could put them in the bank.

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.400
You would get a percentage.

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.520
If you invest that money in your

02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:36.760
own company, you have lost that percentage.

02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:41.960
And this unreceived percentage will

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:48.430
enter the firm's implicit costs.

02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:51.250
Well, let’s say you invested 100

02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:52.930
rubles in your business.

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:56.290
You had to close your

02:07:56.290 --> 02:07:58.890
bank account.

02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:04.170
You have lost 10% of your invested

02:08:04.170 --> 02:08:04.830
money.

02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:20.450
I for simplicity assume that the

02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:23.530
bank pays on deposits also 10%.

02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:28.980
So, the implicit cost that these

02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:30.300
funds you got as if free, but

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.700
that does not mean that their

02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:35.100
use should be taken into account.

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.540
So you invested 100 rubles,

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:41.160
lost 10% on those funds, which

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.880
you could get if you kept that

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.320
money in the bank.

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.420
And accordingly, in the implicit

02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:48.200
costs will include this unreceived

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:49.800
percentage of 10 rubles.

02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:52.360
and further.

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.620
In order to start your business,

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:59.540
you had to leave your job.

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:02.880
You probably worked for hiring before.

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:04.680
So you lost?

02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:07.820
The wage.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:12.520
Unreceived wages will also be included

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:15.360
in the firm’s implicit costs.

02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:19.080
Let’s say, by hiring, you

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.620
earned 200 rubles.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.140
When you start your business, you lose

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.640
those 200 rubles.

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:27.840
These 200 rubles of unreceived

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.280
salary economists include in the implicit

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.420
costs of your company.

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.820
I write.

02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:41.540
Unpaid salary.

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:43.420
How many were there?

02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:45.640
20 rubles, I would say.

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.860
Unpaid salary.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.840
Another assumption.

02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:53.440
Suppose for your business, you have turned

02:09:53.440 --> 02:10:11.430
your apartment into an office or a

02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:12.010
warehouse.

02:10:12.110 --> 02:10:13.670
What did you lose in this case?

02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:15.630
How do you estimate your losses?

02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:20.100
You could provide this apartment

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:22.240
for your business, you lost

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:24.480
those 20 rubles.

02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:31.820
So, the unreceived rent is

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:34.580
also legally included in the implicit

02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.960
costs.

02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:40.380
Unreceived rent is 20 rubles.

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:42.780
Well well well.

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.120
Summarizing all these lost income,

02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:55.240
we get the implicit costs of the company.

02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:59.900
We got 50 rubles.

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.940
It turns out that the total

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:06.480
economic costs of the company

02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:09.140
are accounting costs of 200, implicit

02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:16.020
costs of 50, and that 250

02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:18.000
rubles.

02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:19.700
But now we have to answer the most

02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:21.100
important question.

02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:24.040
Why are economists original?

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.600
For what reason they have invented

02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.780
in addition to the explicit

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.660
or accounting costs, which are

02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:34.220
obvious to all, some implicit

02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:36.800
costs, which, I will repeat,

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.240
the firm does not even pay anyone.

02:11:42.130 --> 02:11:46.810
The implicit costs are those income that

02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:51.050
entrepreneurs have lost by investing their

02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:55.490
resources in the company, which they have provided

02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:58.950
to the company, supposedly free of charge.

02:12:00.010 --> 02:12:00.810
Here is why.

02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:05.710
Without knowing the implicit

02:12:05.710 --> 02:12:09.070
costs, we cannot estimate how

02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:13.030
profitable a business is.

02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:15.290
I have already said about the costs.

02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:18.230
The total economic costs amounted

02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:22.870
to 250 rubles, but after all,

02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:25.610
the firm produces something

02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:28.890
and, suppose, produces, sells

02:12:28.890 --> 02:12:32.030
products and, suppose, the

02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:37.150
annual revenue of the

02:12:38.190 --> 02:12:43.090
firm is, suppose, 240 rubles.

02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.920
How to assess the accountant situation?

02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:56.820
The accountant only takes account

02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.800
of the accounting costs.

02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:00.940
Not because he is so stupid,

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:03.340
but because the accountant guides

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:05.080
certain rules of

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:06.760
accounting.

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.420
The accountant will most likely congratulate

02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:13.280
you on the profit.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:18.100
Revenue 240, accounting expenses 200.

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:34.560
The profit was 40 rubles.

02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.980
How do you assess the situation of an economist?

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.660
The economist is losing.

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:49.840
Revenue minus economic costs.

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.180
It was minus 10.

02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:55.580
Loss of 10 rubles.

02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:00.140
What does this mean in the mouth of an economist?

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.040
And very simple.

02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.620
No one has pulled you into this business.

02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:09.240
If you didn’t go, how much money

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.100
would you have in your wallet

02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:14.100
at the end of the year?

02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:18.180
You would keep your money in the bank.

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.680
You would have a annual interest rate of 10 rubles.

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.080
They would hire themselves.

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:25.560
Annual salary is 20 rubles.

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:27.520
The apartment could be rented.

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.380
The rent would be paid 20 rubles

02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:30.140
per year.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.040
You would have 50 rubles

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.480
in your pocket.

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.300
How much do you have in your pocket

02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:37.840
for the year?

02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.540
Only 40 rubles of accounting profit.

02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:44.660
Profit for 240.

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:46.500
Accountant with 200.

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:48.160
So you have taxes in your

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:48.700
pocket.

02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:49.560
I don’t take, of course.

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.120
40 rubles

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:55.280
So you just do not have a profitable

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.380
business under these conditions.

02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:04.580
Now let us summarize.

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:07.840
Look at the slide.

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:10.900
The difference between revenue

02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:13.000
and accounting costs is

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.580
the accounting profit of the company.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:18.200
We have counted.

02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:20.780
Revenue minus accounting

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:23.320
costs and accounting profit.

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:26.080
The difference between revenue

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:29.760
and economic costs is the

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.080
economic profit or surplus profit

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.700
of the company.

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.640
This is the economic profit,

02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:40.140
the revenue minus the

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:43.440
economic costs.

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:45.860
And the third conclusion we can make.

02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.300
If the profit is negative,

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:52.680
the company has a loss.

02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:55.680
Business is not beneficial to entrepreneurs.

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:01.880
Whatever the amount

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.900
of accounting.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.600
To conclude this question,

02:16:10.610 --> 02:16:12.110
a few examples.

02:16:12.210 --> 02:16:14.190
The first example I will give immediately.

02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:16.450
I invented it.

02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:30.170
Don’t think that we are in the

02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:31.950
department really doing this.

02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:35.270
I know that in a week

02:16:35.370 --> 02:16:53.060
on a business trip I

02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:55.640
will earn, suppose,

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.180
100 rubles.

02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.900
What are those 100 rubles in my examples?

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:06.260
100 rubles is my income.

02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:10.360
That’s what I get on a trip.

02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:17.470
But, as I have, I work at

02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:19.910
the Academy of Foreign Trade.

02:17:20.010 --> 02:17:24.030
I have to give you some lessons

02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:25.430
every week.

02:17:25.710 --> 02:17:27.710
I just cannot leave like that.

02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:30.450
The class will be broken, there will be a scandal.

02:17:31.590 --> 02:17:32.130
What to do?

02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:35.770
I will go to my colleague and say,

02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:39.250
listen, I really need to leave,

02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:45.210
take classes, I am uncomfortable to ask him.

02:17:45.650 --> 02:17:48.130
So I will tell him so, take classes

02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:51.370
for me, I will pay you

02:17:51.370 --> 02:17:54.430
50 rubles.

02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:57.810
There will be no scandal.

02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:59.430
Administration and it is important that

02:17:59.430 --> 02:18:02.250
the course is carried out.

02:18:02.630 --> 02:18:03.610
Who will spend?

02:18:03.710 --> 02:18:04.610
This is the second question.

02:18:04.710 --> 02:18:07.810
So I pay a colleague to

02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:11.850
travel without problems

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:14.110
50 rubles.

02:18:14.210 --> 02:18:19.110
What are those 50 rubles in our terms?

02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:26.400
That’s what I take out of my pocket

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:28.680
and pay to my colleague.

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.640
These are my accounting costs.

02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:35.560
Well, it would seem that everything is okay.

02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:39.500
It is clearly beneficial to go on a trip.

02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:42.660
After all, I will earn 100 rubles on

02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:45.880
a business trip, and I will pay, I

02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:47.420
will bear the cost to go on

02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:49.380
a business trip 50 rubles.

02:18:49.820 --> 02:19:06.750
My accounting income is

02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:09.590
50 rubles.

02:19:09.690 --> 02:19:11.830
But for the sake of simplicity,

02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:16.400
I do not consider any other

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:17.600
accounting costs related to the

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:18.540
trip.

02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.020
But there is one nuance.

02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:23.780
Because of the fact that I am going

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:26.700
on a business trip, I will not be able to read

02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:29.100
a lecture on the MBA program.

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:33.580
No one will make excuses for me here.

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:38.300
But I will not get a salary.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:41.600
Suppose I am paid 60 rubles for

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:43.320
the MBA program.

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:47.760
If I go on a business trip, I don’t

02:19:47.760 --> 02:20:02.590
make those 60 rubles.

02:20:02.890 --> 02:20:06.530
The total cost

02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:07.930
of the trip

02:20:13.430 --> 02:20:18.070
was 110 rubles.

02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:20.490
50 plus 60

02:20:20.590 --> 02:20:23.870
The revenue on the trip is only 100.

02:20:24.890 --> 02:20:33.090
The economic approximation

02:20:33.090 --> 02:20:37.050
of the trip is minus

02:20:37.050 --> 02:20:37.950
10.

02:20:38.050 --> 02:20:40.790
Travelling is unprofitable.

02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:55.310
Another example.

02:20:55.410 --> 02:20:58.630
Suppose you have a small cafe.

02:20:59.790 --> 02:21:03.290
You have decided to set in the

02:21:03.390 --> 02:21:05.530
corner a small or accounting

02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:08.270
cost on this project.

02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:12.530
Well, obviously, the annual depreciation

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:16.170
of the machine and the cost of its annual maintenance.

02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:19.830
What will be included in the implicit cost of the machine?

02:21:24.450 --> 02:21:27.410
I assume that there is no

02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:30.170
free space in your cafe.

02:21:31.390 --> 02:21:33.310
Therefore, if you installed the machine

02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:36.590
in this corner, you will have to remove

02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:38.690
the table.

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:40.130
Well let’s suppose.

02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:42.670
Accordingly, lost profit from the table

02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:45.110
will enter the implicit cost

02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:46.330
of the machine.

02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:49.770
You cannot ignore the implicit costs,

02:21:49.930 --> 02:21:51.330
otherwise you can’t understand

02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:55.680
how profitable or unprofitable

02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:57.260
it is to install the machine.

02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:58.860
Another last example.

02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:04.130
My friend was doing this

02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:07.630
business, maybe now.

02:22:08.130 --> 02:22:11.030
It is an intermediary between the mayonnaise

02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:13.770
plant and the shopping points.

02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:16.670
She took mayonnaise at the

02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:19.550
factory for sale, and then

02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:21.050
arranged it for retail.

02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:25.250
One day she had

02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:26.510
trouble.

02:22:27.850 --> 02:22:29.630
The owner of the container in the

02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:33.870
wholesale refused to buy mayonnaise

02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:37.390
from her, explaining that mayonnaise

02:22:37.390 --> 02:22:38.990
is slowly selling.

02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:41.270
She to me.

02:22:42.430 --> 02:22:44.130
With this question, Sergey

02:22:44.130 --> 02:22:46.650
Georgievich, and what about it fast

02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:47.710
or slow?

02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:50.490
After all, I, she says to me, I don’t

02:22:50.490 --> 02:22:52.910
take money from him, I give him mayonnaise

02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:54.790
for implementation.

02:22:55.490 --> 02:22:56.850
Sold quickly?

02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:58.750
Compare with me quickly.

02:22:59.290 --> 02:23:00.430
Selling slowly?

02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:02.170
Compare with me slowly.

02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:07.130
What does she not understand?

02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:09.530
It does not understand that the owner of

02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:12.490
the container has also implicit costs.

02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:16.110
What are they composed of?

02:23:16.210 --> 02:23:17.490
The container is not rubber.

02:23:18.210 --> 02:23:20.430
If mayonnaise is in this corner,

02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:24.170
there will not be, for example,

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:27.510
the same Estonian cream, which,

02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:29.950
suppose, sells faster.

02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:33.250
So what does it work out?

02:23:33.350 --> 02:23:35.730
Loss of profit from the sale of cream

02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:39.350
will be included in the implicit cost

02:23:39.350 --> 02:23:40.510
of mayonnaise.

02:23:41.370 --> 02:23:43.770
It turns out that the ordinary trader

02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:47.230
in the market, having no notion of these

02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:49.310
scientific terms of obvious and implicit

02:23:49.310 --> 02:23:52.270
costs, cannot fail to take

02:23:52.270 --> 02:23:53.890
into account implicit costs in

02:23:53.890 --> 02:23:56.530
his practical activity.

02:23:56.830 --> 02:24:00.970
We start with the third question, the types of costs.

02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:06.090
All costs, both accounting and

02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:09.430
complete economic, can be divided

02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:13.790
into constant and variable.

02:24:15.850 --> 02:24:18.010
What is at the basis of this division?

02:24:18.330 --> 02:24:20.050
See here.

02:24:20.730 --> 02:24:24.010
The company is increasing the production.

02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:30.860
And it is evident that with the increase of

02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.600
output, some costs change, while

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:36.920
others remain unchanged.

02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:41.260
The costs that do not change with

02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:44.880
the increase in output are

02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.020
called fixed costs.

02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:50.560
The costs that change with the

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:53.860
increase in output are called

02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:56.020
variable costs.

02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:59.020
Why are costs divided into constant

02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:00.720
and variable?

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:05.540
Because we also divide the factors of

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:09.080
production into constant and variable.

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:12.620
The fact is that some factors

02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:16.060
of production can be changed easily

02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:18.500
and quickly with an increase

02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:19.540
in output.

02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:20.860
To increase the issue.

02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:24.500
Well, let’s say, it’s quite easy to hire

02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:27.020
new employees in the company.

02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.360
Workers are a variable factor

02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:31.480
of production.

02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.460
But the company takes a certain

02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:37.340
amount of time to purchase

02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:39.560
new equipment, that is, to use

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.840
additional capital.

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:44.200
Therefore, we usually refer equipment

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:47.260
to a constant factor of production

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:50.200
in a short period of time.

02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:54.460
Look at the definition again on the

02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:55.640
slide.

02:25:56.460 --> 02:25:59.340
Fixed costs are costs that

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.180
do not change with the

02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:04.260
change in output.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.820
This is the cost of constant factors

02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:09.200
of production.

02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:12.400
Usually, the fixed costs

02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.040
include depreciation, rent,

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:17.080
interest on the loan,

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.520
and management salary.

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:21.620
Unclear costs are also

02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:23.300
usually fixed.

02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:27.200
Now the variable costs again.

02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:29.600
Variable costs are costs whose

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.320
value changes with the change

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.320
in output.

02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:36.440
This is the cost of variable factors

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.640
of production.

02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:40.800
These usually include wages in workers'

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:42.720
production, raw materials and

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:45.180
materials costs, electricity

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:47.280
for technological purposes

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:49.060
and others.

02:26:52.810 --> 02:26:56.490
Fixed costs and variable

02:26:56.490 --> 02:26:58.750
costs.

02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:04.450
If we summarize them, we

02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:07.530
get the total cost.

02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:09.910
Please look at the slide.

02:27:10.050 --> 02:27:13.810
FC is fixed cost.

02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:17.650
VC is variable cost, variable

02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:18.930
cost.

02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:21.730
The total cost is TC.

02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:25.470
Total costs of the company.

02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:31.710
It is also important to know

02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:36.850
the unit cost or average cost.

02:27:37.050 --> 02:27:40.510
The average constant cost is indicated

02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:42.490
by the letter AFC.

02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:44.470
Look at the slide.

02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:46.790
These are fixed costs

02:27:46.890 --> 02:27:48.910
per unit of production.

02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:53.730
AFC is equal to FC constant

02:27:53.730 --> 02:27:55.690
cost divided

02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:57.250
by Q.

02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:02.890
Average variable cost, AVC,

02:28:03.890 --> 02:28:05.730
is the variable cost

02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:07.690
per unit of production.

02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:09.850
How to count them?

02:28:10.390 --> 02:28:13.250
We divide the total amount of variable costs

02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:14.910
by the volume of production.

02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:16.790
Look at the formula.

02:28:17.490 --> 02:28:21.590
And finally, the average

02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:25.830
total cost is the total cost

02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:27.930
per unit of production.

02:28:29.850 --> 02:28:30.790
How to calculate?

02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:33.630
Total cost, TC, can

02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:36.130
be divided by

02:28:36.130 --> 02:28:36.870
Q.

02:28:37.930 --> 02:28:39.670
Or else can be counted.

02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:42.450
Average constant and variable

02:28:42.450 --> 02:28:45.750
costs can be summed up.

02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:52.860
A very important role in economic

02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:57.080
analysis is played by marginal

02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.360
cost.

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.180
Limit costs are the increase

02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:05.480
in total costs when the output

02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:08.540
increases by one unit.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.020
Look at the formula.

02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:16.080
mc is equal to delta TC divided by

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.300
delta Q.

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:18.900
How to understand?

02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:22.560
Let’s say, you have already

02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:25.200
produced a few units.

02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.200
You want to produce another

02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:34.080
additional product.

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:39.100
Another additional product.

02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.620
To produce an additional unit

02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:45.620
of products, additional costs

02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.000
must be incurred.

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:51.600
These additional costs, which

02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:53.860
will be required by the production

02:29:53.860 --> 02:29:56.300
of an additional unit of product,

02:29:56.860 --> 02:30:00.520
are the limit costs.

02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:02.880
But look when we increase

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.040
the issue?

02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:09.120
When will the total cost increase?

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.280
The total costs are consisting

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:15.680
of fixed and variable costs.

02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:19.740
Only variable costs increase.

02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:22.360
Fixed costs are not changed over

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:26.060
a short period of time.

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:31.520
The increase in total costs is

02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:36.660
equal to the increase in variable costs.

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:39.920
Thus, the limit costs can be calculated

02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:43.480
by dividing the delta of the growth

02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:45.600
of variable costs, divided by the

02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:48.020
delta of the production.

02:30:51.350 --> 02:30:54.790
To understand this, I give

02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:57.050
an example of calculating

02:30:57.050 --> 02:30:58.170
the cost.

02:30:59.550 --> 02:31:01.570
Please look at the slide.

02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:06.190
There are two types of editions, 10 and 11.

02:31:07.090 --> 02:31:08.770
What are the constant costs?

02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:11.690
50 all the time.

02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:14.090
They do not change with the

02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:16.350
change of the output to determine

02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:17.470
the fixed cost.

02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:20.350
Which are changing?

02:31:20.770 --> 02:31:22.310
The variables change.

02:31:22.310 --> 02:31:25.390
Suppose that 10 was

02:31:25.390 --> 02:31:27.450
100 rubles, and

02:31:27.450 --> 02:31:29.870
11 was 105 rubles.

02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:34.750
All other parameters are easily calculated.

02:31:35.710 --> 02:31:39.170
What is the total cost?

02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:40.830
How many were they at the 10th

02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:41.590
edition?

02:31:42.490 --> 02:31:44.730
50 plus 100, that is 150.

02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:47.950
They are now in the issue 11.

02:31:48.490 --> 02:31:51.310
50 plus 105 – 155.

02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:54.130
Average constant, how to calculate?

02:31:54.610 --> 02:31:55.230
very easy.

02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:57.690
We divide the constant cost by the volume

02:31:57.690 --> 02:31:59.370
of the issue.

02:31:59.570 --> 02:32:02.610
50 divided by 10 is 5.

02:32:02.850 --> 02:32:06.630
5 rubles of fixed costs per unit

02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:08.890
of release at issue 10.

02:32:09.430 --> 02:32:11.830
11 What will we expect?

02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:13.230
50 divided by 11.

02:32:13.330 --> 02:32:15.910
It is approximately 4.55.

02:32:17.370 --> 02:32:19.830
This is the average constant cost of the

02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:21.130
new volume of production.

02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:26.170
Average variable costs.

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:28.510
Variable costs for the issue.

02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:30.110
How many were?

02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:36.590
100 to 10, 10 became 105 to 11, 9 and 55.

02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:40.530
Finally, the average total cost.

02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:41.690
How can I calculate?

02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:46.270
The total cost can be divided by the volume

02:32:46.270 --> 02:32:47.110
of the issue.

02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:49.830
Average constant and average

02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:52.110
variable costs can be

02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:55.570
summed up.

02:32:55.570 --> 02:32:57.530
So, before they were how much?

02:32:57.670 --> 02:33:01.490
5 plus 10, 15 average total costs.

02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:05.930
Now they are 4, 55, 4 and 55

02:33:05.930 --> 02:33:07.690
plus 9.

02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:10.070
14 and 1.

02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:15.730
The last column contains the

02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:17.650
limit costs.

02:33:17.650 --> 02:33:19.690
Limit costs are just one

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.010
value here.

02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:25.050
Limit costs are the increase

02:33:25.050 --> 02:33:27.810
in total costs when production

02:33:27.810 --> 02:33:30.310
increases by one unit.

02:33:30.730 --> 02:33:33.630
Increase in output 1, Increase

02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:36.450
in total costs 5.

02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:39.370
5 for 1 is 5.

02:33:40.130 --> 02:33:41.550
The maximum cost

02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:42.750
is 5 rubles.

02:33:43.430 --> 02:33:46.210
This is an additional cost that

02:33:46.530 --> 02:33:48.950
will have to be borne if we increase

02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:51.730
the output from 10 to 11.

02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:55.470
I would like to point out that

02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:58.270
the limit costs can also be calculated

02:33:58.270 --> 02:34:00.950
by dividing the increase in variable

02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:04.190
costs by the increase in output.

02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:06.950
5 divided by 1 equals 5.

02:34:09.890 --> 02:34:12.350
Now, we go to the fourth issue of

02:34:12.350 --> 02:34:14.390
our topic.

02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:16.870
Costs in the short term.

02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:20.550
A short period in microeconomics

02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:23.390
is a period during

02:34:23.390 --> 02:34:26.310
which some factors

02:34:26.310 --> 02:34:29.830
of production cannot be

02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:33.230
changed and others can

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:35.310
be changed.

02:34:38.010 --> 02:34:40.350
Capital is considered to be a constant

02:34:40.350 --> 02:34:43.410
factor of production, and labour is

02:34:43.410 --> 02:34:45.690
considered to be a variable factor.

02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:52.440
Accordingly, capital costs in the

02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:54.140
short period are fixed costs,

02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:57.500
and labor costs in the short

02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:00.240
period are variable costs.

02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:05.790
Let’s see what the costs

02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:09.310
can be in the short term.

02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:13.190
Let’s start with the constant cost.

02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:18.030
Look at the slide again.

02:35:18.470 --> 02:35:21.130
Fixed costs are those costs

02:35:21.130 --> 02:35:24.470
that do not change with the change

02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:27.950
in the volume of the output.

02:35:28.210 --> 02:35:29.010
See also.

02:35:29.890 --> 02:35:31.950
The issue changes on the left chart,

02:35:32.970 --> 02:35:36.130
and the fixed costs do not change.

02:35:36.310 --> 02:35:39.250
Accordingly, the function of constant costs

02:35:39.250 --> 02:35:41.990
is a straight line of the

02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:43.610
parallel axis x.

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:50.000
Now let’s talk about the function of average

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.060
constant costs.

02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:55.380
What are the average constant costs?

02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:56.840
We have already talked about it.

02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:01.120
They are obtained by dividing the constant cost

02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:03.520
by the volume of production.

02:36:05.890 --> 02:36:07.790
The constant cost number does not change,

02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:10.850
and the volume of production denominator

02:36:10.850 --> 02:36:11.970
changes.

02:36:13.170 --> 02:36:17.210
Set any amount of constant cost.

02:36:17.810 --> 02:36:19.630
Let us suppose 10.

02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:23.740
Let the output be equal to one.

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:26.620
What is the average constant cost?

02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:31.280
10 divided by 1 equals 10.

02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:34.300
Let us say that the output is equal to 2.

02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:37.820
The constant is not changing, and the average

02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:38.940
constant is how much?

02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:42.400
10 divided by 2 ridiculous?

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.020
5 is

02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:46.390
Let the release be equal to 5.

02:36:47.610 --> 02:36:50.050
Average constant 10 divided by 5 is equal

02:36:50.050 --> 02:36:51.690
to 2?

02:36:52.130 --> 02:36:54.330
Let the output be equal to 10.

02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:57.490
10 divided by 10 equals 1.

02:36:58.530 --> 02:37:01.690
And the issue is very big.

02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:06.290
Average constant costs.

02:37:06.290 --> 02:37:08.730
10 for a very large value will

02:37:08.730 --> 02:37:10.250
be a very small value.

02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:12.950
Accordingly, with the growth of output,

02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:14.970
the average constant cost

02:37:14.970 --> 02:37:15.830
tends to zero.

02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:18.410
And in general, the function

02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:21.090
of average constant costs represents

02:37:21.090 --> 02:37:25.970
a parable that is visible on the

02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:27.630
right chart.

02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:35.060
How are they changing?

02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:37.380
What will be the functions of other costs?

02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:41.970
Here, there is no unambiguous answer.

02:37:43.770 --> 02:37:47.430
It all depends on the accepted conditions.

02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:50.530
Let us first consider the simplified

02:37:50.590 --> 02:37:52.690
cost functions.

02:37:53.850 --> 02:37:56.930
They are based on the assumption that

02:37:56.930 --> 02:38:00.170
the limit costs are constant.

02:38:01.390 --> 02:38:04.010
What does it mean that the limit costs are constant?

02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:09.440
This means that with the increase of

02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:15.520
output, the costs increase all the time

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:17.540
by the same amount.

02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.160
Take the example of trade.

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:25.560
Let us have a shop

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:28.260
that sells beer.

02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:33.410
For trade, the volume of release

02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:36.390
is the number of goods sold,

02:38:36.390 --> 02:38:39.850
i.e. the bottles of beer sold.

02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:45.560
What costs are usually

02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:48.200
variable?

02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:53.840
To sell beer, it must be purchased

02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.080
from a wholesaler.

02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:00.260
The more beer we sell, the

02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:03.680
more beer we have to buy.

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.040
Accordingly, the cost of purchasing beer grows

02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.220
with the volume of sales, that is, it grows

02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:10.960
with the volume of production.

02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.800
Therefore, for trade, the purchase

02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:16.800
costs are variable.

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.740
All other costs are considered

02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:22.860
constant in trade.

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:26.940
Those that do not change with the increase of the release.

02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:30.320
The rental fee does not change,

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:33.000
the electricity costs do

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.720
not change.

02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:36.700
If no one has bought anything from

02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:39.240
us, the rent must be paid, the store

02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:41.740
is running, the refrigerators are

02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:44.960
working, the store is illuminated.

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:46.740
The salary of the seller will also be considered

02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.800
independent of the volume of the

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:49.940
issue, that is, we will also be

02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:52.560
considered as a constant cost.

02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:57.410
Look at the table.

02:39:57.890 --> 02:40:01.770
My output varies from 0 to 100.

02:40:01.950 --> 02:40:04.450
The number of bottles sold

02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:06.830
varies from 0 to 100.

02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:09.270
The fixed cost is set

02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:10.510
at 100 rubles.

02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:14.710
They are not dependent on the release.

02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:18.830
The variable cost is the

02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:23.050
cost of buying beer.

02:40:23.050 --> 02:40:26.290
Suppose that each bottle of beer is

02:40:26.290 --> 02:40:29.370
purchased for 5 rubles.

02:40:32.390 --> 02:40:35.890
If we have not bought a bottle

02:40:35.890 --> 02:40:37.690
of beer and sold a bottle of

02:40:37.690 --> 02:40:40.350
beer, the variable cost

02:40:40.350 --> 02:40:41.390
is zero.

02:40:42.490 --> 02:40:44.390
If we bought and sold one bottle

02:40:44.390 --> 02:40:47.050
of beer, the variable cost is equal

02:40:47.050 --> 02:40:49.430
to the cost of purchasing that

02:40:49.430 --> 02:40:52.350
bottle, that is, 5 rubles.

02:40:52.430 --> 02:40:55.190
We bought and sold 2 bottles of

02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:58.670
beer, the variable cost is 10 rubles

02:40:58.670 --> 02:41:01.030
and so on, 15, 20, 25 and

02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:02.930
so on and so on.

02:41:03.310 --> 02:41:06.930
So, variable costs are constantly

02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:09.050
increasing by how much?

02:41:10.330 --> 02:41:13.230
With each next day of release for

02:41:13.450 --> 02:41:14.830
5 rubles.

02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:18.830
These are additional costs

02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:20.710
or limit costs.

02:41:22.210 --> 02:41:25.010
See, fifth column, the limit

02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:26.990
costs, all the time 5, 5,

02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.930
5, 5.

02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:31.450
How much is the total cost?

02:41:32.490 --> 02:41:34.470
With zero-issue, variable costs

02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:36.710
are zero, but constant costs

02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:38.590
still have to be borne.

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:41.890
The total cost is

02:41:41.890 --> 02:41:43.710
100 rubles.

02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:49.030
When issuing 1 constant 100,

02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:51.390
variable 5, only 105 and so on.

02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:55.710
By known formulas, we can calculate

02:41:55.710 --> 02:41:58.410
the average constant and average

02:41:58.410 --> 02:42:00.910
variable costs, as well as

02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:04.870
the average aggregate costs.

02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:07.150
This is what I want to draw your attention to.

02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:12.430
Limit costs are constant.

02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:14.990
With each next unit of product,

02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:18.090
the limit costs increase

02:42:18.090 --> 02:42:21.790
all the time by the same

02:42:21.790 --> 02:42:23.770
amount, by 5 rubles.

02:42:24.190 --> 02:42:29.920
In this case, they are equal

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:33.920
to the average variable cost.

02:42:37.170 --> 02:42:39.510
Well, in fact, if we have a output

02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:42.210
other than one, variable costs

02:42:42.210 --> 02:42:43.290
how much do we have?

02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:44.190
5 is

02:42:45.430 --> 02:42:47.490
With the release of 2 units, the variable

02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:48.510
cost is 10.

02:42:49.850 --> 02:42:52.710
With 3 units 15, with 4 - 20, with

02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:53.910
5 - 25.

02:42:54.930 --> 02:42:57.710
The average variable cost is always

02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:59.870
equal to 5.

02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:03.870
The average variable cost, in my conditional

02:43:03.870 --> 02:43:07.110
example, is exactly the purchase

02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:10.370
price of a bottle of beer.

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:15.930
This is reflected in the next slide.

02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:17.070
See also.

02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:22.670
On axis X we have the output, and on axis

02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:26.930
Y - the marginal and average variable costs.

02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:29.870
The limit costs remain the same with

02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:32.310
the increase in output.

02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:36.780
And they are necessarily equal in this

02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:40.300
case to the average variable costs.

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.960
Now look at how the variable

02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:47.300
and aggregate cost functions go.

02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:52.720
I have already mentioned the permanent.

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:56.480
The function of constant costs goes parallel

02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:57.520
to the X axis.

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:01.040
Let us return to our table.

02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:06.980
Look at how the variable costs change.

02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:10.880
When the issue 0 is 0; when the issue

02:44:10.890 --> 02:44:13.720
1 is 5, when the issue 2 is 10, and so on.

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.520
Variable cost function is a linear function

02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:21.460
that starts from the beginning

02:44:21.470 --> 02:44:22.600
of coordinates.

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:28.540
This is shown in the chart.

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:33.400
How will the total cost function go?

02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:40.560
See, at issue 0 the variable

02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:42.880
costs, as we have already said,

02:44:42.890 --> 02:44:44.500
are equal to 0.

02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:49.540
But constant costs are not equal to 0

02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:53.180
because they must be borne at any volume

02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:55.180
of release.

02:44:56.900 --> 02:44:59.820
In the case of zero-issue, the

02:44:59.830 --> 02:45:02.920
total cost is equal to the constant.

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.100
Then the total cost function.

02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:11.040
It is a linear function, a parallel

02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:12.940
function, going parallel to the

02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:14.540
variable cost function.

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:21.100
The difference between total

02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:23.260
and variable costs is

02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:24.920
the fixed cost.

02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:27.060
This amount does not change.

02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:29.080
These two functions go parallel

02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:31.500
to each other.

02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:35.520
Let us now look at the average

02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:38.080
cost function.

02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:44.720
Remember the formula.

02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:48.120
What is the average total cost?

02:45:50.370 --> 02:45:55.810
These are the average constant costs

02:45:57.690 --> 02:46:01.720
plus the average variable costs.

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:09.020
What do we know about average cost?

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:13.360
With the increase of the output, they decrease

02:46:13.370 --> 02:46:15.660
and aim to zero.

02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:22.600
What do we know about the average

02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:24.160
variable cost?

02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:28.840
In this model, they do not change,

02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:31.140
they are a constant value.

02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:37.640
But if this foldable diminishes

02:46:37.650 --> 02:46:39.740
and tends to zero, and the

02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:44.600
second foldable is a constant, then

02:46:44.610 --> 02:46:47.000
what does the sum seek?

02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:55.920
The amount is aimed at the average

02:46:55.930 --> 02:46:57.620
variable cost.

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.080
This is shown in the chart.

02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:08.020
The higher the output, the lower

02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:11.540
the average total cost, which,

02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:14.140
however, is not aimed at zero,

02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:16.940
but is aimed at average

02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:19.380
variable costs.

02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:22.440
What...

02:47:22.450 --> 02:47:24.780
So, we can make a conclusion.

02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:32.420
The larger the output, the less

02:47:32.430 --> 02:47:35.280
the average total...

02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:38.520
Average constant and corresponding

02:47:38.530 --> 02:47:41.120
total costs.

02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:46.460
A simple question.

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:51.400
Let’s say you are studying economics as

02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:52.700
part of an MBA program.

02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:57.940
You study economics as a group.

02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:00.760
Apply this last conclusion

02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:02.080
that I just made in my

02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:05.300
group.

02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:07.040
Not very difficult.

02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:13.780
What is an MBA issue for the school?

02:48:16.690 --> 02:48:18.810
The number of listeners, right?

02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:22.470
What are we watching?

02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:26.610
The more students in a group,

02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:31.130
the less the cost of training

02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:32.890
for one student.

02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:38.000
So, we have considered simplified

02:48:38.010 --> 02:48:40.100
cost functions.

02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:43.060
Such functions are usually consistent with

02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:45.220
the practice of small.

02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:47.700
But very often in business

02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:50.300
you have to face the same

02:48:50.310 --> 02:48:52.160
complex cost functions.

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:56.020
Here is another premise.

02:48:56.940 --> 02:49:00.400
Limit costs first decrease,

02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:04.040
then reach a minimum, and then

02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:05.800
begin to increase.

02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:07.740
Look at the slide.

02:49:10.270 --> 02:49:10.830
How to understand?

02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:16.290
At first, with the growth of production,

02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:18.990
each additional unit of product

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.110
requires less and less additional costs.

02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:27.130
Then these additional costs

02:49:27.140 --> 02:49:28.810
become minimal.

02:49:29.010 --> 02:49:32.150
After that, each additional unit

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:34.830
of release requires increasing

02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:36.530
additional costs.

02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:42.560
As soon as this is the case, all cost

02:49:42.570 --> 02:49:44.160
functions change.

02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:48.910
Please look at a conditional example.

02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:50.770
The next slide.

02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:54.460
Here, the output in the first

02:49:54.470 --> 02:49:57.740
column varies from zero to ten.

02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:00.920
The fixed cost by definition

02:50:00.930 --> 02:50:03.640
should not change.

02:50:04.300 --> 02:50:07.140
They are always 25, 25, 25.

02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:12.440
Variable costs are changing.

02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:15.170
How they change?

02:50:15.180 --> 02:50:16.810
You will see in the table.

02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:22.330
All other indicators can be calculated.

02:50:22.370 --> 02:50:24.910
As always, the total cost is obtained

02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:27.210
by summing up the fixed

02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:31.430
costs and the variable costs.

02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:34.510
have counted?

02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.430
See you?

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.260
Let’s see how the limit

02:50:45.270 --> 02:50:47.900
cost function changes.

02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:50.000
How can we calculate the

02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:51.800
limit costs?

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:55.560
We take the increase in total costs

02:50:55.570 --> 02:51:00.080
and divide it by the increase in production.

02:51:00.090 --> 02:51:02.600
Increased release all the time of the unit.

02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:05.220
What is the total cost increase

02:51:05.230 --> 02:51:05.880
first?

02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:08.760
55 minus 25 how much is it?

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:10.520
First of 30.

02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:13.680
Then the total cost increases

02:51:13.690 --> 02:51:18.240
24, then 20 and so on.

02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:21.620
What we see means that when issued

02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:24.920
from zero to five, the limit costs

02:51:24.930 --> 02:51:28.180
are constantly decreasing, eventually

02:51:28.190 --> 02:51:30.300
reaching a value of 16.

02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:34.800
After that, starting with issue

02:51:34.810 --> 02:51:36.700
6 and so on, the limit costs

02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:39.220
begin to rise.

02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:42.120
The average and fixed costs are always

02:51:42.130 --> 02:51:43.120
decreasing.

02:51:43.580 --> 02:51:44.920
There is nothing new here.

02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:49.660
The functions of the average variable

02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:52.900
and average total costs change

02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:53.920
immediately.

02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:58.500
Look what they will be now.

02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:05.250
Here is the slide.

02:52:06.670 --> 02:52:11.570
Limit and average costs.

02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:14.530
Look at what happens with

02:52:14.540 --> 02:52:16.270
the limit costs.

02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.380
As I said, first they decrease,

02:52:19.390 --> 02:52:22.520
then they reach the minimum, then

02:52:22.530 --> 02:52:25.480
they begin to strive, then they increase.

02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:28.820
What happens to the average

02:52:28.830 --> 02:52:30.640
variable cost?

02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:33.220
They first fall.

02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:36.320
But they are declining, as you

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:40.020
can see, slower than the limit costs.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:41.040
Then look at.

02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:45.320
Within a certain period of time, the

02:52:45.330 --> 02:52:48.300
limit costs are already increasing.

02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:52.880
And the average variable costs,

02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:57.980
look carefully, they are still decreasing.

02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:03.620
And note that the average variable

02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:07.380
costs decrease until they

02:53:07.390 --> 02:53:10.840
are even above the limit costs.

02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:13.820
Hence the most important conclusion.

02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:18.900
The average variable cost

02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:21.800
reaches its minimum at

02:53:21.810 --> 02:53:26.660
the point where it is equal to

02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:28.340
the limit cost.

02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:36.080
Finally, let’s look at the average

02:53:36.090 --> 02:53:37.880
total cost function.

02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:44.260
This function comes out of infinity.

02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:47.120
For an infinite small quantity,

02:53:47.130 --> 02:53:49.500
the average total cost is very large

02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:51.760
because the output is very small.

02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:54.100
Next What?

02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:59.060
They decline and also necessarily

02:53:59.070 --> 02:54:02.780
reach their minimum at the point where

02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:06.860
they are equal to the limit costs.

02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:10.440
The function of the limit costs necessarily

02:54:10.450 --> 02:54:14.260
crosses the functions of the average

02:54:14.270 --> 02:54:16.680
variable and the average total

02:54:16.690 --> 02:54:21.000
cost at the points of their minimum.

02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:25.980
Once the minimum point is

02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:28.660
passed, the average total

02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:32.460
cost begins to rise.

02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:37.540
As they increase, they are constantly

02:54:37.550 --> 02:54:41.560
approaching the function of

02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:43.060
average variable costs.

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:46.280
Think, why is it so?

02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:51.600
The average total cost is equal

02:54:51.610 --> 02:54:53.960
to what we have already mentioned,

02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:03.980
the average constant cost, plus

02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:07.680
the average variable cost.

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.060
What are the average constant

02:55:11.070 --> 02:55:11.840
costs?

02:55:14.250 --> 02:55:14.850
to zero.

02:55:15.210 --> 02:55:16.390
I have said this many times.

02:55:17.290 --> 02:55:21.090
The average variable cost

02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:25.950
is the average total cost.

02:55:26.730 --> 02:55:29.650
Well, this is actually all about

02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:32.150
the fourth issue of this topic –

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:33.810
the cost in the short term.

02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:38.180
There is another fifth issue on the subject

02:55:38.190 --> 02:55:40.200
– the costs in the long term.

02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:42.860
There will be nothing new there,

02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:45.980
except that I just want

02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:49.380
to emphasize that there

02:55:49.390 --> 02:55:53.640
are no constant costs in

02:55:53.650 --> 02:55:54.820
the long run.

02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:58.900
All costs are variable.

02:55:58.920 --> 02:55:59.420
Why is?

02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.960
Because in the long run, the company

02:56:05.970 --> 02:56:09.260
can change all the factors of production.

02:56:09.700 --> 02:56:10.880
She can find additional

02:56:10.890 --> 02:56:13.080
workers, she can install additional

02:56:13.090 --> 02:56:15.040
equipment, she can rent

02:56:15.050 --> 02:56:18.460
a more spacious

02:56:18.470 --> 02:56:19.800
building.

02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:22.500
All factors of production

02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:24.660
become variable, so all

02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:28.220
costs also become variable.

02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:32.540
There is no function of average

02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:33.580
constant cost.

02:56:34.140 --> 02:56:35.800
Is there only a function?

02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:39.480
The function of the limit costs is the function

02:56:39.490 --> 02:56:41.440
of the average cost.

02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:43.480
And it will be the same.

02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:46.120
The function of the limit costs first

02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:49.360
decreases, then reaches a minimum,

02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:52.080
then begins to increase.

02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:55.180
The average total cost function first

02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:58.180
decreases, then reaches the minimum

02:56:58.190 --> 02:57:00.300
at the point of intersection

02:57:00.310 --> 02:57:03.480
with the limit cost function.

02:57:04.140 --> 02:57:05.820
After that, the average total

02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:09.480
cost function begins to increase.

02:57:16.770 --> 02:57:19.670
Let us start with the fourth topic

02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:21.190
of our course.

02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:25.410
Market Structures and Company Behavior.

02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:28.990
Here we will talk about how the company

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.090
operates in certain market

02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:32.690
conditions.

02:57:34.050 --> 02:57:35.950
And it is probably obvious

02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:39.090
that the behavior of a company depends

02:57:39.100 --> 02:57:41.010
not only on the amount of

02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:43.910
resources it has, but also on the

02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:46.750
market environment in which it operates.

02:57:47.430 --> 02:57:50.030
In other words, the behavior of the company

02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.810
depends on the type of market.

02:57:52.530 --> 02:57:54.710
Please look at the slide.

02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:56.890
The first question we will discuss

02:57:56.900 --> 02:57:58.930
with you is called “types of

02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:01.270
market structures”.

02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:04.690
Or it will be about types of markets.

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:09.560
Please see, there is...

02:58:09.570 --> 02:58:12.020
Microeconomics distinguishes four types

02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:14.640
of market structures or forms of market

02:58:14.650 --> 02:58:16.320
organization.

02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:20.320
This is perfect competition,

02:58:20.900 --> 02:58:24.000
monopoly, oligopoly,

02:58:24.300 --> 02:58:26.320
monopolistic competition.

02:58:31.170 --> 02:58:33.730
Let’s start with perfect competition.

02:58:35.090 --> 02:58:37.350
Well, very often perfect

02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:39.750
competition is misunderstood.

02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:41.810
They think that perfect

02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:45.940
competition is something like

02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:48.460
absolutely harsh, ruthless

02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:50.140
competition.

02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:52.800
Actually nothing like that.

02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:55.140
The definition is very simple.

02:58:55.260 --> 02:58:58.420
Perfect competition is a market

02:58:58.430 --> 02:59:02.260
structure in which there are

02:59:02.270 --> 02:59:05.760
so many sellers and buyers that

02:59:05.770 --> 02:59:10.800
none of them can influence the

02:59:10.810 --> 02:59:13.760
market price by changing

02:59:13.770 --> 02:59:16.440
the volume of their

02:59:16.450 --> 02:59:18.700
supply or demand.

02:59:20.090 --> 02:59:21.990
The price of a product in a completely

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.630
competitive market is determined by

02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:27.690
the interaction of thousands of independent

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:31.810
buyers and hundreds of independent sellers.

02:59:32.290 --> 02:59:34.070
Every buyer and every seller

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:36.890
is a piece of sand on the scale

02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:39.850
of the market, which can not change

02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:42.750
anything in the market by

02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:44.610
its behavior.

02:59:45.010 --> 02:59:48.650
Let’s look at the signs of

02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:50.310
perfect competition.

02:59:52.750 --> 02:59:54.850
Well, I actually said about the

02:59:54.860 --> 02:59:55.790
first sign.

02:59:55.870 --> 02:59:57.570
Here is a sign.

02:59:58.050 --> 02:59:59.630
Each of the very large numbers

02:59:59.640 --> 03:00:01.930
of sellers and buyers has such a

03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:04.530
small market share that they cannot

03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:06.690
change the market price by their

03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:09.930
behavior, but can sell or buy

03:00:09.940 --> 03:00:13.430
as many products as they want

03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:15.810
at that price.

03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:22.740
Let me give you an example, I think it

03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:24.780
will be appropriate.

03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:28.340
Here is a friend who lives

03:00:28.350 --> 03:00:31.160
in the Volgograd province, calls me in

03:00:31.170 --> 03:00:33.840
Moscow and asks what tomatoes in

03:00:33.850 --> 03:00:34.740
Moscow are for?

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:38.900
The case was in the summer and not last

03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:42.180
year, I don’t remember what I answered,

03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:44.440
well, let’s say, 10 rubles per kilogram.

03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:48.060
She had an unfettered curiosity.

03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:51.400
She was going to bring a truck

03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:53.280
with Volga tomatoes to Moscow.

03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:58.390
So, what did she come from, having

03:00:58.530 --> 03:01:00.470
received my information, the price

03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:03.490
of tomatoes in Moscow 10 rubles per kilogram?

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:11.140
It was based on the fact that

03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:13.000
if today the price is so, its appearance

03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:17.120
or not appearance on the

03:01:17.130 --> 03:01:21.140
market can not affect the price.

03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:26.870
But on the other hand, she is confident

03:01:27.250 --> 03:01:28.790
that since she holds a tiny

03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:30.850
share of the tomato market, she

03:01:30.860 --> 03:01:34.310
will be able to sell any quantity

03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:35.810
of her tomatoes at this price,

03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:37.290
10 rubles per kilogram.

03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:41.920
That is, and a ton, and three, and even

03:01:41.930 --> 03:01:44.000
five, and more, she just has no.

03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:47.100
It is clear that if she brought to

03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:49.740
Moscow at the same time, say,

03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:52.440
thousands of tons of tomatoes, then

03:01:52.450 --> 03:01:55.080
such a large seller would necessarily

03:01:55.090 --> 03:01:56.840
influence the market price.

03:01:57.440 --> 03:01:59.240
But that would no longer be a condition

03:01:59.250 --> 03:02:00.500
for perfect competition.

03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:03.780
Under perfect competition, market

03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:06.060
price is determined by the interaction

03:02:07.650 --> 03:02:10.230
of thousands of independent

03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:14.170
buyers, hundreds of independent

03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:16.690
sellers, each piece of

03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:19.930
sand on the general market

03:02:19.940 --> 03:02:22.550
scale, and no one alone

03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:24.330
can influence the price.

03:02:24.770 --> 03:02:26.910
Another example, so that it might

03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:28.410
be better understood.

03:02:29.530 --> 03:02:34.690
You encountered a neighbor at the entrance.

03:02:35.070 --> 03:02:37.870
He comes from the bazar.

03:02:38.930 --> 03:02:41.250
You ask him what tomatoes are for?

03:02:41.810 --> 03:02:45.550
He responds, 10 rubles per kilogram.

03:02:46.810 --> 03:02:49.170
So what are you coming from?

03:02:49.430 --> 03:02:51.850
How soon did that price come up?

03:02:52.910 --> 03:02:55.530
Your appearance or not appearing

03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:58.450
on the market as a buyer

03:02:58.460 --> 03:03:01.450
again can not affect the price.

03:03:02.090 --> 03:03:04.270
But you can buy at this price, for 10

03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.590
rubles, and a kilogram, and 3, and

03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:08.110
5, and even 10.

03:03:09.030 --> 03:03:11.430
That is, you also feel like

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:13.390
a perfect competitor

03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:15.250
in the tomato market, but

03:03:15.260 --> 03:03:17.530
not as a seller, but as a buyer.

03:03:19.690 --> 03:03:21.830
Let’s look at the schedule.

03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:28.180
Balanced market price and demand curve

03:03:28.190 --> 03:03:30.620
for a product of a particular firm.

03:03:30.780 --> 03:03:33.120
Look at two schedules.

03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:37.260
The left chart illustrates the demand

03:03:37.270 --> 03:03:38.920
for supply in a completely

03:03:38.930 --> 03:03:40.360
competitive market.

03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:42.660
I repeat again.

03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:45.860
There are thousands of buyers and hundreds

03:03:45.870 --> 03:03:47.780
of independent sellers.

03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:52.000
On the X-axis we place the total

03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:54.080
number of tomatoes sold and purchased

03:03:54.090 --> 03:03:55.840
on this market.

03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:57.060
And what do we see?

03:03:58.020 --> 03:04:02.200
That at the price P with the star

03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:06.040
we have some market balance.

03:04:06.460 --> 03:04:08.420
Demand on the tomato market

03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:10.560
from all buyers is equal to

03:04:10.570 --> 03:04:12.520
the supply on this market

03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:13.940
from all sellers.

03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:17.000
Now look at the right schedule.

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:21.240
You see, on the X axis I postpone and

03:04:21.250 --> 03:04:23.200
indicate the output, production, volume

03:04:23.500 --> 03:04:25.060
of the cumal.

03:04:26.260 --> 03:04:29.340
It is a separate company.

03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:31.700
This is, in a way, my tomato

03:04:31.710 --> 03:04:33.120
acquaintance.

03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:36.780
If on the left chart the bill goes for

03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:39.360
thousands of tons, then on the right

03:04:39.370 --> 03:04:41.200
chart it only goes for tons.

03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:44.560
It is a sandstone on a market scale.

03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:48.240
And it takes the existing

03:04:48.250 --> 03:04:52.800
market price P with a star as a set.

03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:55.700
As economists say, it is

03:04:55.710 --> 03:05:00.680
a price-taker, the price recipient.

03:05:02.130 --> 03:05:03.950
She takes this price as

03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:06.470
a set and can sell any quantity

03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:10.150
of her tomatoes at that price.

03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:14.570
Note that in perfect competition,

03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:17.690
it cannot raise the

03:05:17.700 --> 03:05:19.050
price.

03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:22.330
No one will buy tomatoes.

03:05:22.570 --> 03:05:25.770
What’s the point of having hundreds

03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:27.850
of sellers with a lower price?

03:05:28.590 --> 03:05:31.630
And it makes no sense to lower

03:05:31.950 --> 03:05:34.690
the price, because at this price

03:05:34.700 --> 03:05:36.790
she can sell any amount of

03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:37.570
her tomatoes.

03:05:38.900 --> 03:05:41.720
It was you and I who saw the first

03:05:41.730 --> 03:05:44.020
sign of perfect competition.

03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:48.040
Let us go back to our signs,

03:05:48.050 --> 03:05:51.520
let us look at the second sign.

03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:54.380
Full homogeneity of products,

03:05:54.540 --> 03:05:56.180
lack of trademarks.

03:05:57.140 --> 03:05:58.200
What does this mean?

03:05:59.770 --> 03:06:05.090
The products of different sellers

03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:07.230
are completely the same in

03:06:07.240 --> 03:06:08.670
the representation of buyers.

03:06:09.330 --> 03:06:12.450
Buyers do not distinguish the product

03:06:12.460 --> 03:06:14.930
of one seller from another and

03:06:14.940 --> 03:06:17.310
the seller himself from the other.

03:06:17.730 --> 03:06:19.290
But when you come to the real

03:06:19.300 --> 03:06:21.370
tomato market, agree, you will

03:06:21.380 --> 03:06:22.750
still walk in the rows, you

03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:24.150
will watch.

03:06:24.610 --> 03:06:26.530
Here, it seems tomatoes are

03:06:26.540 --> 03:06:29.470
red, but this seller seems

03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:31.930
to break a little confidence.

03:06:32.170 --> 03:06:34.250
This is not possible

03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:35.950
in perfect competition.

03:06:36.210 --> 03:06:40.010
All sellers on one person and all

03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:42.610
products are absolutely the same,

03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:43.770
no differences.

03:06:45.230 --> 03:06:48.170
Look at the third sign.

03:06:48.670 --> 03:06:51.090
Free entry and access

03:06:51.100 --> 03:06:53.350
to the market.

03:06:54.860 --> 03:06:58.180
This means that there are no barriers,

03:06:58.190 --> 03:07:00.820
financial, administrative,

03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:03.040
any, that prevented it from

03:07:03.050 --> 03:07:05.420
entering the market of new sellers

03:07:05.430 --> 03:07:08.880
or the departure of sellers

03:07:08.890 --> 03:07:10.800
from this market.

03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:16.560
Let us try this example for the

03:07:16.570 --> 03:07:19.600
discharge.

03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:23.480
Somewhere I read that our current

03:07:23.490 --> 03:07:26.640
president Vladimir Putin in his

03:07:29.010 --> 03:07:30.960
temporary, worked private transportation

03:07:30.970 --> 03:07:33.560
on his jigul.

03:07:33.820 --> 03:07:35.100
What did it mean?

03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:37.260
That he just one day sat down

03:07:37.270 --> 03:07:39.720
at the wheel of his car, went

03:07:40.120 --> 03:07:41.540
to the streets of St. Petersburg,

03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:44.620
that is, entered the private

03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:46.020
market.

03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:50.260
A while later, Vladimir Vladimirovich

03:07:50.270 --> 03:07:52.440
found an interesting job

03:07:52.450 --> 03:07:54.880
as President of Russia.

03:07:55.060 --> 03:07:57.920
This means only that he quietly

03:07:57.930 --> 03:07:59.620
put his jigguls in the garage

03:07:59.630 --> 03:08:02.000
and went to work in the Kremlin.

03:08:02.220 --> 03:08:04.440
As easily he entered the market,

03:08:04.450 --> 03:08:07.480
so easily he left it.

03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:09.900
This is a sign of perfect competition.

03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:12.280
There are no barriers to entry

03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.920
and exit.

03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:17.000
The fourth sign.

03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:20.320
Perfect knowledge of the market

03:08:20.330 --> 03:08:23.980
by sellers and buyers.

03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:27.200
Again, if you come to the real

03:08:27.210 --> 03:08:31.920
tomato market, then you’ll

03:08:31.930 --> 03:08:34.600
probably walk in the rows,

03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:36.200
again, looking.

03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:38.580
Maybe there are tomatoes

03:08:38.590 --> 03:08:41.260
better or a little cheaper.

03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:44.050
This is not possible in

03:08:44.060 --> 03:08:45.170
perfect competition.

03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:50.670
All sellers and all buyers are there.

03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:53.870
They seem to be together at one point.

03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:56.030
All market information

03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:58.750
is instantly disclosed.

03:08:59.050 --> 03:09:01.530
It is equally available to

03:09:01.540 --> 03:09:03.290
all sellers and all buyers.

03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:09.260
Well, if you summarize all that

03:09:09.270 --> 03:09:11.860
I said, you will probably

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.580
agree that perfect competition

03:09:14.590 --> 03:09:17.480
is abstraction.

03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:23.100
Such a market does not really exist.

03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:26.900
There are markets that are more or

03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:30.500
less close to this ideal, but there

03:09:30.510 --> 03:09:31.580
is no perfectly competitive

03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:32.980
market in reality.

03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:35.330
Then the question.

03:09:36.470 --> 03:09:38.310
If there are no competitive

03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:41.170
markets, why study them?

03:09:41.850 --> 03:09:43.910
The answer is very simple.

03:09:44.130 --> 03:09:47.310
For the same reason that the chemist

03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:49.170
studies the properties of, for

03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:51.510
example, absolutely pure distilled

03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:54.170
water, which nature does not exist either.

03:09:55.310 --> 03:09:58.850
It is simply impossible to understand

03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:01.670
the properties of any impurities unless

03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:05.250
we understand, not study the subject in

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.230
some perfect state.

03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:09.430
I was talking about the first type of

03:10:09.530 --> 03:10:11.530
market, perfect competition.

03:10:12.270 --> 03:10:15.650
The second type of market is called monopoly.

03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:19.050
Read the definition.

03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:21.510
Monopoly is a market structure

03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:25.110
in which there is only one company

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:28.690
in the market that produces

03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:32.970
a product that has no close

03:10:32.980 --> 03:10:34.030
substitute.

03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:40.030
Monopolies are found at

03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:43.570
the national, regional, most often

03:10:43.580 --> 03:10:46.810
at the local level.

03:10:47.130 --> 03:10:48.990
In Russia there are national

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.210
monopolies.

03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:55.370
In particular, after the reform

03:10:55.380 --> 03:10:58.690
of RAUIS, the federal network

03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:01.590
company will monopolize

03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:04.210
the power transmission lines.

03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:08.830
Or, say, in our country,

03:11:10.340 --> 03:11:12.350
it is a national monopoly,

03:11:12.690 --> 03:11:16.650
or, say, in our city there is

03:11:16.660 --> 03:11:20.870
only one company offering certain

03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:21.750
services.

03:11:22.290 --> 03:11:24.670
It is a monopoly on the local.

03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:29.430
But the next market structure

03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:32.950
is more common - oligopoly.

03:11:35.140 --> 03:11:36.120
What is it?

03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:37.680
See the definition.

03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:41.320
Oligopoly is a market structure

03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:44.720
characterized by a small

03:11:44.730 --> 03:11:48.400
number of operating firms.

03:11:52.310 --> 03:11:53.970
Examples of oligopoly.

03:11:56.450 --> 03:11:58.450
Two airlines on one

03:11:58.460 --> 03:11:59.370
route.

03:12:00.210 --> 03:12:03.370
In Moscow, the mobile market is controlled,

03:12:03.380 --> 03:12:06.570
if I am not mistaken, by four

03:12:07.310 --> 03:12:08.430
companies.

03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:11.710
Oligopoly is defined as a situation where there

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:16.010
are less than 20 companies in the market.

03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:17.050
This is considered

03:12:17.060 --> 03:12:19.150
an oligopolistic structure.

03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:21.570
This is a very common case

03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:23.910
of oligopoly.

03:12:25.230 --> 03:12:27.890
Oligopoly is a very interesting

03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:28.870
market structure.

03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:33.770
When we looked at

03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:35.930
perfect competition,

03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:39.950
we saw that when a single

03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:43.270
seller makes a decision,

03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:45.610
he does not look at

03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:48.250
other sellers.

03:12:48.630 --> 03:12:50.410
He is a sandstone on the scale of the

03:12:50.420 --> 03:12:52.090
market, he simply accepts the

03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:54.190
market price.

03:12:54.270 --> 03:12:56.810
The monopoly does not look at competitors,

03:12:56.820 --> 03:12:58.950
either, for the simple reason

03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:00.950
that they simply do not exist in

03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:01.690
the monopoly.

03:13:01.890 --> 03:13:07.170
But the olegopolist acts as his

03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:11.830
own capabilities and the behavior

03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:15.350
of other firms allow him.

03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:19.660
The olegopolistic situation

03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:21.940
is similar to a kind of card game

03:13:21.950 --> 03:13:27.160
where there is no single pre-

03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:29.000
set model of behavior.

03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:32.360
Each player plays as the

03:13:32.370 --> 03:13:36.400
cards are allowed and as the

03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:38.160
competitors play.

03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:40.780
In the context of oligopoly,

03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:44.380
strategic behavior is formed.

03:13:47.050 --> 03:13:52.350
At the same time, individual olegopolists

03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:54.650
can choose one or another form of

03:13:54.660 --> 03:13:57.090
rivalry, one or another strategy

03:13:57.100 --> 03:14:00.390
of rivalry or adopt a strategy

03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:03.430
of conspiracy.

03:14:03.450 --> 03:14:04.550
So happens too.

03:14:07.460 --> 03:14:09.940
The fourth type of market

03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:12.080
is monopolistic competition.

03:14:12.860 --> 03:14:14.200
Read the definition.

03:14:14.940 --> 03:14:17.400
Monopolistic competition is a

03:14:17.410 --> 03:14:20.120
market structure in which

03:14:20.130 --> 03:14:23.220
a group of goods that are close

03:14:23.230 --> 03:14:25.180
substituents are produced

03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:27.800
by a large number of independent

03:14:27.810 --> 03:14:30.280
firms.

03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:31.620
Try to explain.

03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:35.980
Let us remember the perfect

03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:38.180
competition.

03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:42.240
There were a lot of firms there.

03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:46.000
In theory, it is infinite.

03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:50.100
In the conditions of monopolistic

03:14:50.110 --> 03:14:52.600
competition, may not be so

03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:54.060
many, but also very many.

03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:57.740
But there are fundamental differences.

03:14:58.180 --> 03:15:00.300
Remember, I said that in perfect

03:15:00.310 --> 03:15:04.640
competition, the products of individual

03:15:04.650 --> 03:15:07.400
firms are absolutely indistinguishable

03:15:07.410 --> 03:15:10.340
in the eyes of the buyers.

03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:12.640
The companies are completely the same.

03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:14.920
This is not the case

03:15:14.930 --> 03:15:16.520
with monopolistic competition.

03:15:16.780 --> 03:15:21.460
Here, each company has a certain distinction

03:15:21.470 --> 03:15:26.340
that distinguishes it, its products

03:15:26.350 --> 03:15:30.760
or its own from other firms.

03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:40.760
It is a mini monopoly.

03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:44.000
It is a mini-monopoly in a very narrow

03:15:44.010 --> 03:15:46.580
segment of the market.

03:15:46.590 --> 03:15:47.360
Here is example.

03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:51.520
There are many cafes in our city, but

03:15:51.530 --> 03:15:55.800
I distinguish this cafe from what.

03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:58.440
Maybe it’s a cafe, I think, maybe

03:15:58.450 --> 03:16:00.860
it’s a better place to eat in this

03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:02.680
cafe, maybe there’s a more

03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:05.100
sympathetic waitress, maybe the

03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:07.520
interior is more attractive, or

03:16:07.530 --> 03:16:08.740
maybe this cafe is just

03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:10.620
located closer to my home.

03:16:12.170 --> 03:16:15.820
That is, in the conditions

03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:18.260
of monopolistic competition, I repeat

03:16:18.270 --> 03:16:22.520
again, individual firms, possessing

03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:25.200
some distinctive features,

03:16:25.210 --> 03:16:27.760
possess a small but still

03:16:27.770 --> 03:16:29.780
monopolistic power in

03:16:29.790 --> 03:16:32.220
a narrow segment of the

03:16:32.230 --> 03:16:33.400
market.

03:16:34.850 --> 03:16:38.320
And now look, it is necessary

03:16:38.330 --> 03:16:42.080
to distinguish between pure

03:16:42.090 --> 03:16:47.860
monopoly and monopoly power.

03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:51.520
Monopoly power arises where

03:16:52.260 --> 03:16:56.180
a single firm has some

03:16:56.190 --> 03:16:58.580
control over the price.

03:17:03.370 --> 03:17:07.130
It can change the price within

03:17:07.140 --> 03:17:10.670
certain limits.

03:17:12.230 --> 03:17:14.590
This is not the case with perfect competition.

03:17:15.010 --> 03:17:18.510
Please look at the left schedule.

03:17:18.990 --> 03:17:20.630
On the left is a very competitive

03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:22.590
company.

03:17:22.970 --> 03:17:25.370
I have already said that in perfect

03:17:25.380 --> 03:17:28.190
competition, a single firm,

03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:31.450
being a sandstone on the general

03:17:31.460 --> 03:17:33.750
market scale, can sell

03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:35.910
any quantity of its products

03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:39.050
at the market price.

03:17:39.350 --> 03:17:42.390
The function of demand for a product

03:17:42.400 --> 03:17:45.010
of a completely competitive company

03:17:45.020 --> 03:17:47.290
is a horizontal line.

03:17:47.670 --> 03:17:51.770
The market can buy any quantity

03:17:51.780 --> 03:17:54.810
of its products at the current

03:17:54.820 --> 03:17:56.750
market price.

03:17:57.530 --> 03:17:59.410
Changing the price of a completely

03:17:59.420 --> 03:18:01.930
competitive company cannot by definition.

03:18:02.750 --> 03:18:04.290
But a firm with a monopoly

03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:06.730
power may change the price to

03:18:06.740 --> 03:18:08.790
a greater or lesser extent.

03:18:08.970 --> 03:18:11.370
Please look at the right schedule.

03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:13.430
There, the demand function for the

03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:16.090
company's product has a negative slope.

03:18:18.840 --> 03:18:22.140
This means that the company can

03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:24.600
raise or lower the price.

03:18:24.610 --> 03:18:29.180
But it is clear that by raising the

03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:31.220
price, it will face a decrease in

03:18:31.230 --> 03:18:33.060
demand for its product.

03:18:34.220 --> 03:18:38.780
And if the price is lower, it will face its increase.

03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:42.040
No super monopoly can abolish

03:18:42.050 --> 03:18:45.180
the laws of demand.

03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:49.460
But what is obvious is that it is important

03:18:49.470 --> 03:18:54.100
that the more the slope of demand

03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:58.360
for a company's product, the lower

03:18:58.370 --> 03:19:00.500
its monopoly power.

03:19:01.900 --> 03:19:07.400
So I have just said that by the inclination

03:19:07.410 --> 03:19:11.200
of the demand function on a firm’

03:19:11.210 --> 03:19:14.740
s product, one can judge how

03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:17.020
great its monopoly power is.

03:19:27.850 --> 03:19:28.790
Well, please look at the quantity of the

03:19:29.170 --> 03:19:30.390
goods, as always, the price of the goods,

03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:37.260
and let’s say the function of demand

03:19:37.270 --> 03:19:39.420
is going like this.

03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:45.270
Look what it means.

03:19:45.310 --> 03:19:47.610
You see, the function has a

03:19:47.620 --> 03:19:48.830
fairly high tilt.

03:19:54.060 --> 03:19:58.940
So, a firm can raise the price quite

03:19:58.950 --> 03:20:02.440
significantly from P0 to P1, see,

03:20:02.620 --> 03:20:04.680
a significant price increase, without

03:20:04.690 --> 03:20:09.060
fear of losing a large volume

03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:10.040
of demand.

03:20:20.580 --> 03:20:24.660
In other words, it is difficult for the consumer

03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:27.080
to do without the product of this company.

03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:30.800
Even with a large price rise, the

03:20:30.810 --> 03:20:34.240
fall in demand will be minor.

03:20:35.420 --> 03:20:38.420
We say that the company

03:20:38.430 --> 03:20:41.140
has a high monopoly power.

03:20:43.070 --> 03:20:45.290
Now imagine a monopoly

03:20:45.300 --> 03:20:47.530
competitive company.

03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:51.370
The function of demand for its product goes

03:20:51.380 --> 03:20:53.190
very much by logo.

03:20:58.530 --> 03:21:02.330
So, the company can raise the price.

03:21:02.350 --> 03:21:05.350
This is the demand function for its product.

03:21:05.690 --> 03:21:07.630
But note, the company has

03:21:07.950 --> 03:21:11.670
raised the price very slightly.

03:21:12.810 --> 03:21:14.830
How much did you lose in demand?

03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:18.950
very much.

03:21:19.210 --> 03:21:22.790
A slight price increase has led

03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:25.390
to a significant decline in demand.

03:21:25.400 --> 03:21:26.250
Why so?

03:21:27.070 --> 03:21:29.130
In the context of monopolistic

03:21:29.140 --> 03:21:31.790
competition, the product

03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:34.110
has many substitutes.

03:21:34.750 --> 03:21:37.110
Therefore, with a slight increase

03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:40.870
in the price, buyers can easily switch

03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:45.990
to the product of other companies.

03:21:47.720 --> 03:21:49.160
What extreme case?

03:21:49.340 --> 03:21:53.140
The perfect competition.

03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:56.640
When the line of demand for the

03:21:56.650 --> 03:22:00.840
company’s product becomes such a slope

03:22:02.180 --> 03:22:06.260
that it becomes horizontal.

03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:09.220
The company has no

03:22:09.230 --> 03:22:11.180
control over the market

03:22:11.190 --> 03:22:12.540
price.

03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:17.360
He can only accept the price.

03:22:17.370 --> 03:22:23.180
Now let us look at the reasons

03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:25.840
why monopoly power

03:22:25.850 --> 03:22:29.800
can arise and exist.

03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:34.060
I identify three reasons.

03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:36.380
The first reason is very simple.

03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:38.620
Exclusive rights

03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:41.020
granted by authorities.

03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:45.620
Well, let’s say, local

03:22:45.630 --> 03:22:48.860
or regional authorities,

03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:52.120
or all-Russian authorities, only my

03:22:52.130 --> 03:22:55.260
firm is allowed to engage in this

03:22:55.270 --> 03:22:56.240
type of activity.

03:22:56.920 --> 03:22:59.200
Other companies simply do not

03:22:59.210 --> 03:23:01.100
get the appropriate license.

03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:06.200
This leads to an administrative

03:23:06.210 --> 03:23:08.360
monopoly.

03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:13.480
If the license is granted to several

03:23:13.490 --> 03:23:18.700
companies, we are given an administrative oligopoly.

03:23:19.140 --> 03:23:21.940
Now let us talk about the second reason

03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:25.660
for the existence of monopoly power.

03:23:26.560 --> 03:23:29.260
It is the exclusive ownership

03:23:29.270 --> 03:23:31.760
of any production resource.

03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:34.780
I have said many times that

03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:37.120
to do something, you need

03:23:37.380 --> 03:23:38.500
resources.

03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:41.120
Imagine, please, that some important

03:23:41.130 --> 03:23:43.760
resource for the production

03:23:43.770 --> 03:23:48.000
of this product is in the

03:23:48.010 --> 03:23:50.040
exclusive property

03:23:50.050 --> 03:23:53.060
of this firm.

03:23:53.580 --> 03:23:55.600
Only she can produce

03:23:55.610 --> 03:23:57.160
this product.

03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:59.420
Others can’t, and our company

03:23:59.430 --> 03:24:02.540
is a monopolist.

03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:04.040
The example.

03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:09.060
Alcoa was once the monopoly

03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:12.440
on the American aluminum

03:24:12.450 --> 03:24:14.320
market.

03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:16.900
Her monopoly was based on

03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:19.200
the fact that she alone

03:24:19.210 --> 03:24:21.660
owned all the bacit fields

03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:23.040
in Chile.

03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:29.200
Only a surgeon can perform

03:24:29.210 --> 03:24:31.300
this operation.

03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:37.880
He is the monopolist of his talent.

03:24:38.180 --> 03:24:40.100
Only he has the teaching talent,

03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:43.040
and on this basis there

03:24:43.050 --> 03:24:45.320
is a monopoly.

03:24:49.540 --> 03:24:53.980
Or only this company has a patent

03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:55.920
on the latest technological

03:24:55.930 --> 03:24:57.620
development.

03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:01.600
It is becoming a monopoly.

03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:04.640
If a resource belongs to

03:25:04.650 --> 03:25:07.080
several firms, it is no longer

03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:13.180
a monopoly, but an oligopoly.

03:25:17.140 --> 03:25:20.240
The third reason for monopoly power

03:25:20.250 --> 03:25:24.780
is the increasing return on scale.

03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:27.120
Here it is a little more difficult.

03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:32.180
Let us remember what is

03:25:32.190 --> 03:25:35.920
increasing return on scale.

03:25:36.140 --> 03:25:37.780
What does she mean?

03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:39.580
When does it emerge?

03:25:39.620 --> 03:25:41.740
When do we talk about increasing

03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:43.280
scale?

03:25:47.580 --> 03:25:50.260
When the number of resources

03:25:50.270 --> 03:25:53.440
used increases by N times, production

03:25:53.450 --> 03:25:57.140
increases by more than

03:25:57.150 --> 03:25:58.840
N times.

03:25:59.820 --> 03:26:01.020
We talked about this, if you remember,

03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:02.860
in the previous topic.

03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:07.520
But if there is an increasing return

03:26:07.530 --> 03:26:10.200
on scale, it means that

03:26:10.210 --> 03:26:16.820
the larger the output, the less

03:26:19.170 --> 03:26:22.330
the company costs per unit

03:26:22.340 --> 03:26:23.470
of products.

03:26:24.310 --> 03:26:25.970
Think really.

03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:35.000
The company is twice as large

03:26:35.540 --> 03:26:37.780
as a small company.

03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:41.500
It uses twice as much labor

03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:43.180
and capital.

03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:48.580
And the output of it increases by three times

03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:49.520
at the same time.

03:26:50.420 --> 03:26:53.740
This means that the unit

03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:57.000
cost of the product will be less.

03:26:58.380 --> 03:27:03.560
So, in this case, the larger the volume

03:27:03.570 --> 03:27:08.900
of production, the less the cost per

03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:11.500
unit of products.

03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:19.360
Once that happens, the companies are starting to grow.

03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:21.880
In fact, look at it.

03:27:21.890 --> 03:27:26.980
Here is the beginning of the twentieth century.

03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:30.040
Dozens of independent companies

03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:32.960
operated in the United

03:27:32.970 --> 03:27:34.040
States.

03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:36.620
What happens next?

03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:43.000
With the cash, several firms have grown.

03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:47.500
The amount of resources increased in

03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:49.980
them, well, suppose, conditionally twice.

03:27:51.780 --> 03:27:55.440
The output has increased four

03:27:55.450 --> 03:27:56.160
times.

03:27:56.940 --> 03:27:59.940
So, the larger company

03:27:59.950 --> 03:28:03.200
costs per unit of product.

03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:06.120
Less than smaller companies.

03:28:06.380 --> 03:28:07.560
What does this lead to?

03:28:08.240 --> 03:28:10.600
Big companies are growing,

03:28:10.610 --> 03:28:13.580
small companies are breaking down.

03:28:13.980 --> 03:28:16.660
In the end, there may be

03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:19.260
only one company on

03:28:19.270 --> 03:28:20.440
the market.

03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:24.060
If there are several companies in the market,

03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:30.520
we are talking about a natural oligopoly.

03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:33.020
See the definition

03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:37.980
of natural monopoly.

03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:40.940
The natural monopoly.

03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:44.740
A natural monopoly is a company

03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:48.760
that can meet any market demand

03:28:48.770 --> 03:28:51.780
with small and lower long-

03:28:51.790 --> 03:28:53.660
term average costs than those

03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:56.060
that would have been

03:28:56.070 --> 03:28:59.200
created if two or more

03:28:59.210 --> 03:29:02.180
companies were in the

03:29:02.190 --> 03:29:03.940
market instead.

03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:09.140
What is the nature of

03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:10.380
natural monopoly?

03:29:12.160 --> 03:29:15.930
The fact that its special monopoly

03:29:15.940 --> 03:29:20.210
position is not based on

03:29:20.220 --> 03:29:23.490
administrative resources, not

03:29:23.500 --> 03:29:25.310
on some other factors that can be

03:29:27.340 --> 03:29:30.210
eliminated in principle, and

03:29:30.220 --> 03:29:33.910
its monopoly position is based

03:29:33.920 --> 03:29:36.850
on the cost advantages.

03:29:36.860 --> 03:29:38.470
Hence an important conclusion.

03:29:39.330 --> 03:29:41.510
It is pointless to fight

03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:45.070
against natural monopoly by its scaling.

03:29:47.330 --> 03:29:51.670
If we create two instead of one

03:29:51.680 --> 03:29:53.510
large firm, which is a natural

03:29:55.590 --> 03:29:58.580
monopoly, the production of

03:29:58.590 --> 03:30:01.820
each will be twice as small as that

03:30:02.140 --> 03:30:03.280
of a large firm.

03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:08.960
The cost will be higher

03:30:08.970 --> 03:30:10.960
per unit of product.

03:30:12.690 --> 03:30:14.690
Well, here I will try

03:30:14.700 --> 03:30:17.290
to illustrate the natural monopoly

03:30:17.300 --> 03:30:19.570
by a number of examples.

03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:22.400
Here is the simplest example.

03:30:24.470 --> 03:30:31.910
In our homes in the kitchen two pipes,

03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:35.150
one with hot water, the other with cold water.

03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:41.470
Water to our homes is supplied by one company,

03:30:41.480 --> 03:30:44.350
the water channel bridge.

03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:47.610
But monopoly is bad, most

03:30:48.750 --> 03:30:49.910
often.

03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:52.950
And, well, when monopoly is usually

03:30:52.960 --> 03:30:56.070
overpriced, it is usually

03:30:57.430 --> 03:30:58.190
low quality.

03:30:58.750 --> 03:31:00.190
Why then, if the monopoly is bad,

03:31:00.200 --> 03:31:03.630
why do we then, in pursuit of competition,

03:31:03.640 --> 03:31:07.470
do not carry on every kitchen

03:31:07.480 --> 03:31:10.330
a lot of hot and cold water

03:31:10.340 --> 03:31:11.450
pipes, belonging to

03:31:11.490 --> 03:31:13.630
different companies?

03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:14.850
Companies could compete

03:31:14.860 --> 03:31:16.310
with each other.

03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:20.110
And we could choose the water

03:31:20.270 --> 03:31:23.330
that is cheaper or, say, cleaner.

03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:27.790
It is not done for a very simple reason.

03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:32.310
The cost of each liter of water will increase.

03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:34.290
Here is a very conditional example.

03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:42.630
Suppose the consumption of water

03:31:42.640 --> 03:31:44.450
per unit of time, no matter, a year,

03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:46.650
a month, a day, is conditionally

03:31:46.660 --> 03:31:48.470
100 liters.

03:31:53.610 --> 03:31:55.710
To bring a pipeline with water into the

03:31:55.720 --> 03:31:58.630
apartment, you need to spend 100 rubles.

03:32:04.300 --> 03:32:07.340
The cost of one liter of

03:32:07.350 --> 03:32:12.100
water is one ruble.

03:32:16.140 --> 03:32:18.460
Now imagine that in pursuit of competition

03:32:18.470 --> 03:32:22.500
we have spent at least two pipes

03:32:22.510 --> 03:32:25.940
in the apartment, supplying water,

03:32:26.240 --> 03:32:28.320
which is delivered by

03:32:28.330 --> 03:32:30.740
different companies.

03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:33.540
Two different companies supply water to

03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.960
our homes.

03:32:34.240 --> 03:32:38.380
But then, if two pipes, the cost of

03:32:38.390 --> 03:32:42.420
the padding will increase exactly twice

03:32:42.430 --> 03:32:46.120
and now make up 200 rubles in total.

03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:54.970
And the consumption of water in the

03:32:54.980 --> 03:32:56.770
apartment will remain, it will not change

03:32:56.780 --> 03:32:59.110
from this, will remain as -still 100 liters.

03:32:59.770 --> 03:33:00.950
And what will happen?

03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:14.700
The cost of each liter is 2 rubles.

03:33:14.710 --> 03:33:18.780
So, this means that it is not profitable

03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:23.020
to create several companies competing

03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:24.860
with each other instead

03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:26.240
of one monopoly.

03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:31.620
The unit cost of products will increase.

03:33:31.920 --> 03:33:34.220
This is a natural monopoly.

03:33:34.640 --> 03:33:37.260
I repeat, a natural monopoly is

03:33:37.270 --> 03:33:41.760
a firm whose monopoly position

03:33:41.770 --> 03:33:42.760
is based on cost

03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:47.230
advantages and is associated

03:33:47.240 --> 03:33:50.210
with increasing scale returns.

03:33:50.230 --> 03:33:52.030
If we create several companies

03:33:52.040 --> 03:33:55.110
instead of one, the cost

03:33:55.120 --> 03:33:57.810
per unit of the product

03:33:57.820 --> 03:33:59.950
will increase.

03:34:00.250 --> 03:34:01.350
How did we get it?

03:34:01.390 --> 03:34:04.250
In my conditional example.

03:34:04.510 --> 03:34:05.230
Another example.

03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:07.410
RAU of Russia.

03:34:09.250 --> 03:34:11.490
This company is doing a lot

03:34:11.500 --> 03:34:12.270
now.

03:34:12.310 --> 03:34:14.070
It is engaged in both

03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:18.280
power generation and

03:34:18.290 --> 03:34:20.220
transmission through

03:34:20.230 --> 03:34:22.880
power lines and through

03:34:22.890 --> 03:34:25.440
its subsidiaries.

03:34:30.990 --> 03:34:35.210
Well, look, let’s say, it’s all power

03:34:35.220 --> 03:34:38.170
plants that generate companies.

03:34:42.350 --> 03:34:44.390
This is the electric transmission line.

03:34:51.390 --> 03:34:55.580
It is the sale of electricity to consumers.

03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:00.780
Which of these three

03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:04.600
areas of activity is a

03:35:04.610 --> 03:35:06.120
natural monopoly?

03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:14.980
Clear electric transmission line.

03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:20.070
The reform of the RAO of the

03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:22.130
EU envisages its elimination in its

03:35:22.140 --> 03:35:22.730
present form.

03:35:23.850 --> 03:35:26.690
From the RAO of the EU will

03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:28.710
be separated as independent firms

03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:31.250
wholesale generating companies

03:35:31.260 --> 03:35:34.210
and territorial generating companies.

03:35:34.590 --> 03:35:39.070
Generation can be in the field of competition.

03:35:39.330 --> 03:35:41.390
Generating companies can

03:35:41.400 --> 03:35:43.430
compete with each other.

03:35:43.650 --> 03:35:45.350
There is no natural monopoly.

03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:48.950
The electricity transmission line should

03:35:48.960 --> 03:35:49.670
be one.

03:35:50.370 --> 03:35:53.350
Because if we put another line

03:35:53.360 --> 03:36:00.030
next to that line for competition.

03:36:00.230 --> 03:36:02.670
The cost of the installation will increase

03:36:02.680 --> 03:36:04.130
exactly twice.

03:36:04.450 --> 03:36:06.930
The cost of each kilowatt hour of

03:36:06.940 --> 03:36:08.810
electricity transmission

03:36:08.820 --> 03:36:11.150
will increase.

03:36:11.430 --> 03:36:13.870
The electricity transmission line

03:36:13.880 --> 03:36:15.170
is a natural monopoly.

03:36:15.630 --> 03:36:19.450
And after the reform of the RAU

03:36:19.460 --> 03:36:21.990
EU, the power transmission line will

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:25.030
remain owned by the federal network company.

03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:27.470
This would be a natural monopoly

03:36:28.050 --> 03:36:29.410
in which the control of the stock

03:36:29.420 --> 03:36:30.630
is owned by the state.

03:36:32.430 --> 03:36:33.250
well well well.

03:36:34.290 --> 03:36:41.200
And if we take the sphere of Gazprom,

03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:45.100
what is there a natural monopoly?

03:36:48.890 --> 03:36:50.610
Gas pipelines obviously.

03:36:52.680 --> 03:36:54.320
Independent companies

03:36:54.330 --> 03:36:55.860
can produce gas.

03:36:55.960 --> 03:37:01.310
But here is the pipe, until it is of course

03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:04.330
not filled to the end, it is better

03:37:04.340 --> 03:37:05.150
if there is only one.

03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:08.710
Otherwise, the cost of gas transmission will increase.

03:37:09.010 --> 03:37:11.830
Every unit of gas, I mean, will grow.

03:37:12.210 --> 03:37:15.850
In the RAO and RZD field,

03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:17.050
the Russian railways are

03:37:17.060 --> 03:37:18.610
a natural monopoly.

03:37:19.850 --> 03:37:21.970
The roads and all

03:37:21.980 --> 03:37:23.530
the railway infrastructure.

03:37:25.240 --> 03:37:27.580
Vans and locomotives are

03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:29.380
private property.

03:37:29.390 --> 03:37:30.540
It is owned by independent

03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:32.260
competing companies.

03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:35.440
They are not natural monopolies.

03:37:36.140 --> 03:37:37.220
This is actually going on.

03:37:37.620 --> 03:37:40.420
Sooner or later, only roads and infrastructure

03:37:40.430 --> 03:37:44.420
will remain in the property of RAO and the Railway.

03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:46.000
The rest will be owned

03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:47.860
by independent firms that

03:37:48.020 --> 03:37:49.960
will compete with each other.

03:37:50.660 --> 03:37:54.480
So, we have looked at the different

03:37:54.490 --> 03:37:58.160
types of existing market structures.

03:37:59.910 --> 03:38:02.870
Now, we go to the second issue of this topic.

03:38:02.970 --> 03:38:04.430
income of the company.

03:38:06.090 --> 03:38:09.390
First of all, the concept of gross

03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:12.670
income or revenue of the company.

03:38:14.290 --> 03:38:17.370
It is marked by the letters TR Total Revenue.

03:38:17.570 --> 03:38:19.430
gross income or income.

03:38:20.110 --> 03:38:21.070
What is it?

03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:22.670
It is very simple.

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:26.430
The revenue of the company is the product of the

03:38:26.440 --> 03:38:30.050
price of the goods on the volume of production.

03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:32.850
On the slide you can see the formula.

03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:36.470
TR is equal to P multiplied by Q.

03:38:37.210 --> 03:38:39.210
The usual formula of revenue.

03:38:40.090 --> 03:38:42.530
Another term used is the average

03:38:42.540 --> 03:38:44.490
income of the company.

03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:47.370
The average income of the company.

03:38:47.380 --> 03:38:48.670
Look at the slide.

03:38:49.050 --> 03:38:53.250
This is a private revenue division on the

03:38:53.260 --> 03:38:55.510
volume of release or implementation.

03:38:58.350 --> 03:39:02.790
But it is not difficult to understand that

03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:07.370
if the revenue on the volume of release will get the price.

03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:12.010
So average income is just another

03:39:12.020 --> 03:39:13.890
name for price.

03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:23.250
Graphically, it is possible to build

03:39:25.890 --> 03:39:28.680
a revenue function if we deal with

03:39:28.690 --> 03:39:31.320
a completely competitive company.

03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:34.440
What is different, remember?

03:39:36.580 --> 03:39:40.210
A completely competitive company

03:39:40.220 --> 03:39:42.770
has a price set.

03:39:43.410 --> 03:39:46.530
The company cannot change the price.

03:39:48.130 --> 03:39:51.050
And hence it follows that the function

03:39:51.060 --> 03:39:53.830
of revenue from the release of a completely

03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:56.810
competitive firm is a linear function

03:39:56.820 --> 03:40:00.270
that comes from the beginning of the coordinate.

03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:04.170
With zero release, the revenue is zero.

03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:09.590
In the single issue, we get the issue

03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:12.610
multiplied by the given price and

03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:13.710
so on.

03:40:14.610 --> 03:40:16.450
The function of revenue will

03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.230
be linear.

03:40:20.360 --> 03:40:25.140
The next very important concept in

03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:29.760
microeconomics is the limit income.

03:40:30.380 --> 03:40:32.260
Margin of Revenge.

03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:35.280
The definition of the limit income is

03:40:35.290 --> 03:40:37.440
read on the slide.

03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:40.860
The company's limit income is

03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:45.540
the increase in revenue when sales

03:40:45.550 --> 03:40:48.560
increase by one unit.

03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:55.630
That is, MR is equal to Delta

03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:57.610
TR divided by Delta Cube.

03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:04.870
Does nothing remind you of

03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:06.030
the limit income?

03:41:06.490 --> 03:41:10.950
Something of what we studied, looked

03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:14.990
at in the previous topic.

03:41:15.290 --> 03:41:16.870
Remember, in the previous topic we

03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:19.450
talked about the limit costs?

03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:22.520
Let us remember.

03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:26.620
Limit costs are the increase in total

03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:29.400
costs, with the increase in production

03:41:29.410 --> 03:41:31.920
by one unit.

03:41:32.460 --> 03:41:36.000
A marginal income is the increase in

03:41:36.010 --> 03:41:38.980
revenue, with an increase in output

03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:42.240
or sales by one unit.

03:41:42.540 --> 03:41:46.520
Accordingly, the limit income is the

03:41:46.530 --> 03:41:50.040
additional income that the company

03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:54.480
receives when it releases and sells

03:41:54.490 --> 03:41:57.860
an additional unit of the product.

03:41:58.020 --> 03:42:00.960
Here is the simplest example

03:42:00.970 --> 03:42:04.980
of calculating the limit income.

03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:06.560
Look at the slide.

03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:10.480
Yes, just another small comment.

03:42:10.780 --> 03:42:14.220
If we are talking about a completely competitive

03:42:14.230 --> 03:42:18.340
company, then its marginal income

03:42:18.350 --> 03:42:22.160
is equal to the price of the goods.

03:42:23.530 --> 03:42:25.690
Well, in fact, a completely

03:42:25.700 --> 03:42:29.030
competitive company sells any volume

03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:31.570
of its products at the

03:42:31.580 --> 03:42:34.890
current market price.

03:42:35.050 --> 03:42:37.070
The price for a completely competitive

03:42:37.080 --> 03:42:39.550
company is set.

03:42:42.490 --> 03:42:46.250
And if so, then each additional

03:42:46.260 --> 03:42:49.130
unit of release brings such

03:42:49.140 --> 03:42:51.870
a company an additional

03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:54.970
revenue, the additional

03:42:55.250 --> 03:42:57.770
income is equal to this

03:42:57.780 --> 03:42:59.710
price.

03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:03.610
Well, if a company, for example, sells products

03:43:03.620 --> 03:43:06.170
all the time at the price of 10 rubles,

03:43:06.180 --> 03:43:09.730
then each additional unit of release

03:43:09.740 --> 03:43:12.690
will increase the company's revenue

03:43:12.700 --> 03:43:15.350
by those same 10 rubles.

03:43:16.450 --> 03:43:17.950
The marginal income of a firm, a

03:43:17.960 --> 03:43:19.570
firm that is completely

03:43:19.580 --> 03:43:21.750
competitive, is necessarily

03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:24.370
equal to the price of the goods

03:43:24.380 --> 03:43:26.010
at which it sells its products.

03:43:27.130 --> 03:43:29.350
Well, and look, please, at the table,

03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:31.770
on the slide.

03:43:32.110 --> 03:43:35.150
In the first column, the company's issue

03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:36.790
changes.

03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:40.390
I change it from zero to five.

03:43:41.270 --> 03:43:43.450
The price, as we have said, for

03:43:43.460 --> 03:43:45.490
a completely competitive company,

03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:47.170
is constant.

03:43:47.410 --> 03:43:48.990
10 rubles is.

03:43:49.690 --> 03:43:53.950
By multiplying the price by the volume of sales,

03:43:53.960 --> 03:43:57.600
I get the company's revenue.

03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:00.980
It changes with the change of the release.

03:44:01.260 --> 03:44:04.140
You see it changes linearly.

03:44:04.150 --> 03:44:06.780
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

03:44:07.100 --> 03:44:08.840
What we just talked about.

03:44:11.470 --> 03:44:13.830
What is the limit income?

03:44:14.190 --> 03:44:15.290
Let us count.

03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:17.050
What is the Limit Income?

03:44:18.050 --> 03:44:20.350
This is the revenue delta, that is,

03:44:20.360 --> 03:44:23.330
the increase in revenue divided by the

03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:24.830
increase in release.

03:44:25.470 --> 03:44:28.050
The increase in output here is always

03:44:30.140 --> 03:44:32.770
one, and the increase in revenue

03:44:32.780 --> 03:44:35.310
is always ten.

03:44:35.320 --> 03:44:38.430
That is, the marginal income is equal,

03:44:38.440 --> 03:44:40.890
I repeat, to the price of a product

03:44:40.900 --> 03:44:43.430
for a completely competitive firm, I repeat.

03:44:43.770 --> 03:44:45.470
For monopoly, this will no longer be the

03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:47.210
case, we will talk about it again.

03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:50.670
We move to the third question.

03:44:52.840 --> 03:44:56.520
The balance of a completely competitive company.

03:44:58.410 --> 03:45:01.470
Here we proceed from the fact that

03:45:01.480 --> 03:45:04.990
the company seeks to maximize

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:05.970
its profit.

03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:09.090
What is Profit?

03:45:09.100 --> 03:45:10.770
It is very simple.

03:45:11.230 --> 03:45:12.790
Look at the slide.

03:45:13.130 --> 03:45:15.510
Profit is the difference between

03:45:15.520 --> 03:45:20.230
the company's revenue and its total costs.

03:45:20.410 --> 03:45:25.330
That is, the profit is equal to TR

03:45:25.340 --> 03:45:28.770
revenue minus TS total costs.

03:45:28.850 --> 03:45:32.410
And again, the company wants this

03:45:32.420 --> 03:45:35.770
difference, that is, to maximize profit.

03:45:38.340 --> 03:45:41.920
Theoretically, the problem is solved very simply.

03:45:42.780 --> 03:45:46.420
The profit of the company is maximum

03:45:46.430 --> 03:45:50.600
at such volume of production, when

03:45:50.610 --> 03:45:55.060
its limit income becomes equal to

03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:56.700
the limit costs.

03:45:59.710 --> 03:46:01.210
How to explain?

03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:02.850
See also.

03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:07.730
My company is engaged in the production

03:46:07.740 --> 03:46:10.950
of a product or service.

03:46:12.930 --> 03:46:17.510
Let’s say I’m increasing the issue

03:46:17.520 --> 03:46:18.930
by one more.

03:46:21.060 --> 03:46:25.460
I will receive an additional income

03:46:25.470 --> 03:46:28.220
or in our terms a limit income.

03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:29.660
It is good.

03:46:30.420 --> 03:46:34.800
But at the same time I will have to

03:46:34.810 --> 03:46:36.360
bear additional costs.

03:46:36.370 --> 03:46:37.060
It is bad.

03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:40.820
However, if the additional

03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:43.600
income, i.e. the marginal income,

03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:47.180
is higher than the additional costs,

03:46:47.190 --> 03:46:49.480
i.e. the marginal costs, then

03:46:49.490 --> 03:46:51.580
the additional unit

03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:54.660
of production will increase

03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:57.860
the profit of my firm.

03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:04.590
And while the marginal income exceeds the

03:47:06.260 --> 03:47:09.290
marginal costs, the increase in output

03:47:09.300 --> 03:47:13.270
leads to an increase in the profit of

03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:15.410
the total profit received by the firm

03:47:15.420 --> 03:47:16.950
from all output units.

03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:23.760
So once the marginal income was

03:47:23.770 --> 03:47:27.180
equaled with the marginal costs,

03:47:27.190 --> 03:47:30.900
the additional unit of production

03:47:30.910 --> 03:47:33.960
ceased to increase the company’

03:47:33.970 --> 03:47:35.700
s total profit.

03:47:36.780 --> 03:47:41.680
The total profit reached its maximum.

03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:45.710
Thus, the profit is far greater than

03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:48.990
that of a competing firm at the maximum,

03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:51.730
at the volume of production at which

03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:54.070
the price at which it sells its

03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:57.910
products is equal, becomes equal

03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:00.190
to its limit costs.

03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:02.730
Let us make it more clear,

03:48:02.740 --> 03:48:05.770
let us look at a conditional

03:48:05.780 --> 03:48:07.130
numerical example.

03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:10.920
Here, please, look at the table

03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:15.160
in the first column of the change of the

03:48:15.500 --> 03:48:18.780
release from zero to ten.

03:48:20.230 --> 03:48:23.370
The second column is constant costs.

03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:25.390
Well, the fixed costs they do not

03:48:25.400 --> 03:48:27.970
change by definition, they do not depend

03:48:27.980 --> 03:48:29.850
on the release.

03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:32.350
You see, all the time 60, no matter what

03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:33.270
the volume of release.

03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:36.350
The third column variable

03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:39.630
costs shows how variable costs

03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:41.970
change along with the change

03:48:41.980 --> 03:48:43.030
in output.

03:48:45.190 --> 03:48:49.090
These amounts are given initially.

03:48:49.410 --> 03:48:52.030
All other values, at least

03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:53.530
in terms of costs, are

03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:55.330
calculable.

03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:59.170
Knowing the fixed and variable

03:48:59.180 --> 03:49:01.270
costs, we can calculate

03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:02.730
the total costs.

03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:06.190
We can calculate the average

03:49:06.200 --> 03:49:08.570
constant costs, the average

03:49:08.580 --> 03:49:11.230
variable costs and the average

03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:13.350
total costs.

03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:14.890
I hope you remember the formula.

03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:20.690
Finally, in the next column,

03:49:20.700 --> 03:49:24.650
we have the limit costs.

03:49:24.810 --> 03:49:25.990
How do we get them?

03:49:26.010 --> 03:49:28.590
The cost, look again.

03:49:29.230 --> 03:49:32.790
Limit costs are the increase in

03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:36.330
total costs, with the increase

03:49:36.340 --> 03:49:39.650
of production by one unit.

03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:42.530
My number is growing by

03:49:42.540 --> 03:49:43.250
one.

03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:46.150
I divide the increase in total

03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:49.970
cost per unit by the increase in production.

03:49:50.230 --> 03:49:53.570
So, when moving from zero

03:49:53.580 --> 03:49:56.590
to zero, the total cost

03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:01.210
increases by 32 rubles.

03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:04.230
This is the limit costs.

03:50:04.250 --> 03:50:07.130
These additional costs will have to

03:50:07.140 --> 03:50:09.630
be borne if we want to increase

03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:12.950
the output from zero to one.

03:50:15.070 --> 03:50:17.710
Furthermore, the output was increased

03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:20.850
by one from one to two.

03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:24.330
How much does the total cost increase?

03:50:26.060 --> 03:50:27.400
of 20 units.

03:50:27.820 --> 03:50:30.400
This is the limit costs when moving

03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:32.380
from issue one to issue two

03:50:32.390 --> 03:50:34.420
and so on.

03:50:35.420 --> 03:50:38.080
Note that the limit costs

03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:44.590
first decrease, then reach

03:50:44.600 --> 03:50:49.110
the minimum, when the four

03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:51.630
limit costs become

03:50:53.190 --> 03:50:56.620
minimum, and then the limit

03:50:56.630 --> 03:51:00.200
costs start to increase.

03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:02.440
That is, we are dealing

03:51:02.450 --> 03:51:05.960
with the classic U-shaped curve

03:51:05.970 --> 03:51:07.060
of the limit cost.

03:51:07.660 --> 03:51:08.940
That we have already mentioned in

03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:10.970
the previous shadow.

03:51:11.290 --> 03:51:15.650
The next column is the price.

03:51:17.490 --> 03:51:19.650
But if a firm is completely competitive,

03:51:19.660 --> 03:51:21.890
then, as I have said many times, the

03:51:21.900 --> 03:51:25.130
limit income of such a firm is

03:51:25.140 --> 03:51:28.470
always equal to the price of

03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:30.110
the goods at which it sells

03:51:30.120 --> 03:51:31.010
its products.

03:51:33.330 --> 03:51:35.930
So the price I set, the conditional price

03:51:35.940 --> 03:51:38.650
of 30, the limit income of a completely

03:51:38.660 --> 03:51:40.530
competitive firm is constant

03:51:40.540 --> 03:51:42.170
and equal to the price.

03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:46.850
Now look closely at the table.

03:51:50.640 --> 03:51:56.300
We increase output all the time and

03:51:56.310 --> 03:52:00.540
here, starting with two output

03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:04.540
units, the limit income or price

03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:07.320
exceeds the limit costs.

03:52:07.440 --> 03:52:10.160
For example, in issue 3, the limit

03:52:10.780 --> 03:52:12.760
income is equal to what?

03:52:15.970 --> 03:52:21.390
The maximum cost is 12.

03:52:22.610 --> 03:52:23.670
What does that mean?

03:52:26.660 --> 03:52:28.920
That if we release a third

03:52:28.930 --> 03:52:33.960
unit of products, our profit will increase.

03:52:34.960 --> 03:52:38.020
In fact, look at the last column.

03:52:40.730 --> 03:52:42.350
Profit in this zone is

03:52:42.360 --> 03:52:46.820
still negative, but with increased

03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:49.920
output, negative profit begins

03:52:49.930 --> 03:52:52.140
to decrease.

03:52:55.010 --> 03:52:56.470
That is, the profit is increasing.

03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:07.910
And look, here at issue 5 we already

03:53:07.920 --> 03:53:12.210
get a positive profit.

03:53:12.220 --> 03:53:13.110
It is equal to 8.

03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:17.210
However, we will not stop

03:53:17.220 --> 03:53:18.630
at this edition.

03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:20.940
Why is?

03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:23.660
Because if we produce a sixth unit

03:53:23.670 --> 03:53:26.140
of the product, what is the

03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:27.280
limit income?

03:53:27.840 --> 03:53:28.240
30 is

03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:29.280
It is always 30.

03:53:29.800 --> 03:53:32.900
The maximum cost is 18.

03:53:35.560 --> 03:53:37.600
That is, the sixth unit of products

03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:40.300
will require 18 rubles of additional

03:53:40.310 --> 03:53:42.900
costs, but will bring 30 rubles

03:53:42.910 --> 03:53:45.480
of additional income.

03:53:50.640 --> 03:53:51.720
Meaning is.

03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:53.920
How much will the profit increase?

03:53:55.280 --> 03:53:56.300
for 12 rubles.

03:53:57.060 --> 03:53:59.600
In fact, when the release 5 profit

03:53:59.610 --> 03:54:02.180
was 8, and when the release 6 it is already

03:54:02.190 --> 03:54:04.300
equal to 20.

03:54:05.480 --> 03:54:08.980
The profit increased by 12 rubles.

03:54:10.140 --> 03:54:11.480
Let us see further.

03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:15.040
In the 7th edition, what do we see?

03:54:17.530 --> 03:54:20.090
Limit income 30, limit expenses

03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:21.310
24.

03:54:22.210 --> 03:54:24.370
So, an additional unit of release

03:54:24.380 --> 03:54:27.310
increases our profit by 6

03:54:27.320 --> 03:54:28.050
rubles.

03:54:28.510 --> 03:54:29.430
So it happened.

03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:32.690
The profit increased by 6 rubles and

03:54:32.700 --> 03:54:34.250
reached 26 rubles.

03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:38.110
When is the profit maximum?

03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:41.690
It becomes maximum, strictly

03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:46.330
speaking, at the time when the limit

03:54:46.340 --> 03:54:51.390
income is equal to the limit costs.

03:54:53.250 --> 03:54:55.550
See, when you issue 8 the

03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:59.770
limit income 30, the limit expenses

03:54:59.780 --> 03:55:01.050
also 30.

03:55:01.390 --> 03:55:03.750
They were compared to each other.

03:55:04.010 --> 03:55:06.630
This means that the profit

03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:09.330
has stopped increasing.

03:55:10.030 --> 03:55:14.390
If the marginal income of the 8th

03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:17.130
edition were at least a penny

03:55:17.140 --> 03:55:20.850
more than the marginal cost, this

03:55:20.860 --> 03:55:23.250
additional unit of output would

03:55:23.260 --> 03:55:25.050
increase our profit.

03:55:25.270 --> 03:55:27.270
So, just as soon as the

03:55:27.280 --> 03:55:28.890
marginal income equaled the

03:55:28.900 --> 03:55:30.750
marginal costs, the profit reached

03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:32.330
its maximum.

03:55:32.370 --> 03:55:34.990
But here is the ninth unit of products,

03:55:35.350 --> 03:55:37.910
note, to release is pointless.

03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.450
Why is?

03:55:40.090 --> 03:55:41.790
What is the limit income of the

03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:43.130
ninth unit of product?

03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:45.290
Thirty as usual.

03:55:45.890 --> 03:55:48.030
What limit costs will it require?

03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:49.170
and 40.

03:55:49.690 --> 03:55:52.950
So the ninth unit of the product

03:55:52.960 --> 03:55:56.330
will reduce our total profit by

03:55:56.340 --> 03:55:56.950
ten rubles.

03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.870
So it happened.

03:55:58.430 --> 03:56:00.850
The total profit at nine units

03:56:00.860 --> 03:56:04.990
of release is only sixteen.

03:56:05.190 --> 03:56:08.390
The maximum point is passed.

03:56:09.190 --> 03:56:12.930
In the case of the release, eight companies

03:56:12.940 --> 03:56:15.530
are in a state of balance.

03:56:15.890 --> 03:56:18.830
It is not beneficial to reduce

03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:21.410
or increase its output.

03:56:23.540 --> 03:56:25.740
Now we’ll look at the same thing,

03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:28.800
but on the schedule.

03:56:30.660 --> 03:56:33.220
Look carefully, do not rush

03:56:33.230 --> 03:56:36.420
to what is shown here on this chart.

03:56:37.940 --> 03:56:41.580
Well, all these charts could be obtained

03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:46.520
if we started to transfer the numbers

03:56:46.530 --> 03:56:48.840
from the previous table

03:56:48.850 --> 03:56:51.260
to the chart.

03:56:53.020 --> 03:56:56.420
In fact, yes you see the price line,

03:56:56.430 --> 03:57:00.300
it goes horizontally parallel

03:57:00.310 --> 03:57:05.020
to the X axis, the release axis.

03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:08.900
The price is set.

03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:13.190
It does not change with the

03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:15.290
change of the release.

03:57:16.570 --> 03:57:18.910
The price changes, and the price is constant.

03:57:19.390 --> 03:57:21.050
And the limit income, as we have said,

03:57:21.060 --> 03:57:22.870
is equal to the price.

03:57:23.290 --> 03:57:26.650
In my example, the price was 30 rubles.

03:57:27.770 --> 03:57:29.570
And she does not change.

03:57:30.190 --> 03:57:31.110
not change.

03:57:33.890 --> 03:57:36.310
Look at the limit cost

03:57:36.320 --> 03:57:37.250
function.

03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:39.410
What are the limit costs?

03:57:40.350 --> 03:57:44.950
First they decrease, then they begin to grow.

03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:49.350
This is reflected in the drawing.

03:57:49.570 --> 03:57:51.170
Do you see the cost limit function?

03:57:51.770 --> 03:57:54.710
First it decreases, then at some volume

03:57:54.720 --> 03:57:57.050
of release reaches a minimum,

03:57:57.060 --> 03:57:59.350
then the MC function

03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:01.030
begins to increase.

03:58:01.130 --> 03:58:01.510
See you?

03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:07.810
Now look at the AC function.

03:58:08.690 --> 03:58:09.990
What is AC?

03:58:11.250 --> 03:58:15.450
This is a function of average total costs.

03:58:17.050 --> 03:58:17.810
What is she?

03:58:17.850 --> 03:58:19.890
Back to the table.

03:58:20.470 --> 03:58:21.990
Look at this function.

03:58:22.270 --> 03:58:23.330
That is so.

03:58:23.890 --> 03:58:26.410
It first with the increase of

03:58:26.420 --> 03:58:28.870
the output, the average total cost

03:58:28.880 --> 03:58:35.270
of AC decreases, then with the release

03:58:35.280 --> 03:58:38.870
7 as you see reach the minimum

03:58:38.880 --> 03:58:41.790
and then the average total cost

03:58:41.800 --> 03:58:44.630
starts to increase as actually reflected

03:58:44.640 --> 03:58:47.430
in our figure.

03:58:51.000 --> 03:58:54.480
In this picture, there are

03:58:54.490 --> 03:58:57.380
several critical points.

03:58:59.490 --> 03:59:05.570
The first point corresponds to Q1.

03:59:08.470 --> 03:59:12.280
Please see what we observe

03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:15.660
in the release interval from 0 to

03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:18.000
Q1.

03:59:20.470 --> 03:59:24.330
In this interval, the limit costs

03:59:24.340 --> 03:59:27.250
look closely above the price

03:59:27.260 --> 03:59:33.720
of the product or the limit

03:59:33.730 --> 03:59:36.420
income of the company.

03:59:36.430 --> 03:59:40.100
In this period, the company’

03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:43.180
s losses only increase.

03:59:43.620 --> 03:59:44.700
So it is.

03:59:48.250 --> 03:59:48.930
See you?

03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:56.310
In the range from 0 to 1, the limit costs

03:59:56.320 --> 03:59:59.990
are greater than the limit income.

04:00:00.000 --> 04:00:04.150
Accordingly, when issuing 1 loss

04:00:04.160 --> 04:00:08.590
of the company a negative profit.

04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:10.510
The biggest ones.

04:00:10.520 --> 04:00:15.110
Look further at the painting.

04:00:15.290 --> 04:00:18.590
What do we see in the release interval

04:00:18.600 --> 04:00:22.370
from Q1 to Q2?

04:00:23.090 --> 04:00:26.510
In this interval, the limit income is already

04:00:26.520 --> 04:00:28.730
greater than the limit costs.

04:00:29.430 --> 04:00:32.530
This means that each

04:00:32.540 --> 04:00:36.970
additional unit of release already

04:00:36.980 --> 04:00:40.450
increases our profit.

04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:43.050
But the total profit remains

04:00:43.060 --> 04:00:46.510
negative due to the load of past losses.

04:00:46.930 --> 04:00:50.670
What do we see in Q2?

04:00:51.350 --> 04:00:55.870
In this Q2 issue, the price of the

04:00:57.270 --> 04:01:01.610
goods becomes equal to the

04:01:01.620 --> 04:01:03.870
average total cost.

04:01:04.110 --> 04:01:05.410
See this?

04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:10.210
In Q2, the price is equal to the

04:01:10.220 --> 04:01:12.130
average total cost.

04:01:12.530 --> 04:01:15.970
The price is equal to the average cost.

04:01:16.530 --> 04:01:19.150
The average and total costs

04:01:19.160 --> 04:01:22.690
are the costs per 1 issue.

04:01:24.850 --> 04:01:27.490
If the price is equal to the cost

04:01:27.500 --> 04:01:30.830
of 1 issue, the profit becomes

04:01:30.840 --> 04:01:32.230
zero.

04:01:34.350 --> 04:01:40.310
Therefore, the Q2 release corresponds to the

04:01:40.320 --> 04:01:43.310
point of non-loss of the company.

04:01:43.470 --> 04:01:47.950
When issued 2, the profit of the company is zero.

04:01:50.090 --> 04:01:52.910
When issued from zero to Q2, the company

04:01:52.920 --> 04:01:54.770
is losing.

04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:57.850
It is in the loss zone.

04:01:58.650 --> 04:02:02.610
And only when it reaches the Q2 release the company

04:02:02.620 --> 04:02:05.650
brings the ends to the ends for the first time.

04:02:06.690 --> 04:02:09.150
It reaches the point of unprecedentedness.

04:02:09.470 --> 04:02:12.430
If we are less, we are doomed to loss.

04:02:13.050 --> 04:02:16.070
If we reached Q2 release, the company

04:02:16.080 --> 04:02:17.690
has reached this release.

04:02:19.200 --> 04:02:21.320
Loss is zero, but profit

04:02:21.330 --> 04:02:21.920
is zero.

04:02:22.040 --> 04:02:24.960
We are at the point of unfailingness.

04:02:25.440 --> 04:02:29.720
What further increase in the output

04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:32.670
leads to?

04:02:33.270 --> 04:02:36.910
That the price is already above

04:02:36.920 --> 04:02:38.890
the average total cost.

04:02:41.080 --> 04:02:45.710
That is, with each unit of product

04:02:45.720 --> 04:02:48.610
we get more money than the

04:02:48.620 --> 04:02:50.930
cost per unit of product.

04:02:51.210 --> 04:02:55.450
So we are in a profit zone.

04:02:58.550 --> 04:03:03.170
And look, the price always

04:03:03.180 --> 04:03:06.850
exceeds the limit costs.

04:03:07.010 --> 04:03:11.670
So the more we produce,

04:03:11.680 --> 04:03:15.770
the more our profits.

04:03:20.610 --> 04:03:22.550
The more our profits.

04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:29.510
Where is the maximum profit?

04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:33.670
It is maximum, as I said, at

04:03:33.680 --> 04:03:38.970
the point where the company’

04:03:42.520 --> 04:03:45.770
s limit costs become

04:03:45.780 --> 04:03:48.450
equal to the price.

04:03:50.370 --> 04:03:52.970
In the Q3 release.

04:03:55.230 --> 04:03:58.510
In Q3, the company receives

04:03:58.520 --> 04:04:01.810
the maximum total profit.

04:04:03.400 --> 04:04:04.120
well well.

04:04:05.060 --> 04:04:08.140
And if we are going to increase

04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:15.280
output, beyond Q3, what do we

04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:16.700
get, what do we see?

04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:22.000
The limit costs are already higher than

04:04:22.010 --> 04:04:23.640
the price.

04:04:25.800 --> 04:04:28.900
This means that the maximum profit

04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:30.080
is passed.

04:04:33.240 --> 04:04:35.930
Maximum profit is reached.

04:04:36.310 --> 04:04:40.070
Profit has already begun to decrease.

04:04:40.310 --> 04:04:42.150
The balance point of the completely

04:04:42.160 --> 04:04:44.550
competitive Q3 company.

04:04:45.130 --> 04:04:49.670
With this issue, the company receives

04:04:49.680 --> 04:04:50.990
maximum profit.

04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:53.930
If the company still increases the output,

04:04:53.940 --> 04:05:01.030
in the interval from Q3 to Q4 the

04:05:01.040 --> 04:05:03.490
profit is still positive, but the

04:05:03.500 --> 04:05:04.790
maximum is passed.

04:05:05.650 --> 04:05:10.930
And when the Q4 is released, what do we see?

04:05:12.050 --> 04:05:17.010
The price of the goods again becomes equal

04:05:17.020 --> 04:05:19.450
to the average cost, or the cost per

04:05:19.460 --> 04:05:20.430
unit of the product.

04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:22.890
But if the price is equal to the

04:05:22.900 --> 04:05:25.250
cost per unit of product, the total

04:05:25.260 --> 04:05:27.910
profit becomes zero.

04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:32.910
This is the second point of unfailingness.

04:05:33.230 --> 04:05:34.630
But if we continue to persevere,

04:05:34.640 --> 04:05:36.190
continue to build output,

04:05:36.200 --> 04:05:39.010
we will already have

04:05:39.020 --> 04:05:41.350
a negative profit.

04:05:41.530 --> 04:05:46.310
We will fall into the zone of loss again.

04:05:52.430 --> 04:05:57.790
Let us complicate the situation a little.

04:05:59.570 --> 04:06:02.190
Imagine what terrible happened.

04:06:04.770 --> 04:06:07.130
I have said that a completely

04:06:07.140 --> 04:06:10.670
competitive company has no

04:06:10.680 --> 04:06:13.450
control over the price.

04:06:15.080 --> 04:06:18.940
Despite the company’s will, the market price

04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:20.260
has fallen.

04:06:21.380 --> 04:06:23.240
And now it is...

04:06:23.250 --> 04:06:26.920
Look at the new slide.

04:06:28.380 --> 04:06:33.740
The market price is 24 rubles.

04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:40.810
All other data regarding

04:06:40.820 --> 04:06:43.210
costs remain the same.

04:06:46.390 --> 04:06:48.510
What does this mean now?

04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:52.830
Look closely at the

04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:58.920
last column, the last column.

04:07:00.500 --> 04:07:04.020
At such a low price, the company

04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:07.440
is doomed to losses at any volume

04:07:07.450 --> 04:07:08.580
of production.

04:07:10.300 --> 04:07:13.720
Whatever the issue, the company

04:07:13.730 --> 04:07:15.100
will be losing.

04:07:16.020 --> 04:07:19.280
What can the company do in such conditions?

04:07:21.690 --> 04:07:27.250
It can only minimize the loss.

04:07:27.850 --> 04:07:30.450
Maximum profit in this case means

04:07:30.460 --> 04:07:33.910
the minimum of the loss received,

04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:38.820
but the rule remains the same.

04:07:39.260 --> 04:07:43.140
When is maximum profit achieved?

04:07:44.080 --> 04:07:46.860
When the limit income is equal

04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:48.480
to the limit cost.

04:07:48.780 --> 04:07:55.560
See 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 See

04:07:55.570 --> 04:07:59.580
the eighth and ninth columns.

04:07:59.640 --> 04:08:02.620
In the eighth column, we have the

04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:05.360
limit costs, in the ninth column,

04:08:05.370 --> 04:08:07.040
we have the limit income equal to

04:08:07.050 --> 04:08:08.200
the price.

04:08:08.600 --> 04:08:11.980
Where are the limit costs equal

04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:13.920
to the limit income?

04:08:13.930 --> 04:08:16.680
7 in the issue now.

04:08:18.040 --> 04:08:19.560
And look at it, please.

04:08:20.020 --> 04:08:25.600
This will maximize the profit of the company.

04:08:25.700 --> 04:08:28.460
In other words, the loss is minimal.

04:08:29.100 --> 04:08:31.720
Repeat maximum profit in this

04:08:31.730 --> 04:08:34.460
case means receiving the

04:08:34.470 --> 04:08:36.500
minimum loss.

04:08:36.660 --> 04:08:38.960
The loss is minimal at release 7.

04:08:42.020 --> 04:08:46.620
But here comes the main question.

04:08:47.500 --> 04:08:48.180
See you?

04:08:48.280 --> 04:08:50.800
The company cannot avoid losses.

04:08:51.180 --> 04:08:52.620
At such a low price.

04:08:52.900 --> 04:08:56.480
It can only minimize the loss.

04:08:57.940 --> 04:09:00.200
But maybe it’s worth just stopping?

04:09:00.580 --> 04:09:01.940
Stop production and all.

04:09:04.270 --> 04:09:06.950
We cannot avoid losses.

04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:11.330
Let us close.

04:09:12.050 --> 04:09:13.670
Stop the release of products.

04:09:14.110 --> 04:09:15.790
If the product is damaged, we

04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:18.090
will stop production.

04:09:18.730 --> 04:09:19.390
and all.

04:09:21.150 --> 04:09:24.710
In fact, it would be a bad decision.

04:09:28.150 --> 04:09:28.570
Why is?

04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:32.790
Let us consider the cost theory.

04:09:39.090 --> 04:09:43.970
In the short term, there are constant

04:09:43.980 --> 04:09:47.690
costs that cannot be avoided.

04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:54.910
Even if the company closes, that is,

04:09:54.920 --> 04:09:57.430
the output will be zero.

04:09:57.710 --> 04:10:00.970
There are constant costs that

04:10:01.270 --> 04:10:03.550
will still have to be borne.

04:10:04.490 --> 04:10:06.390
What are the constant costs?

04:10:09.320 --> 04:10:11.060
They are equal, see the second

04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:13.320
column, 60.

04:10:15.980 --> 04:10:19.220
If the company closes, it will

04:10:19.230 --> 04:10:20.480
lose revenue.

04:10:20.840 --> 04:10:21.920
She produces nothing,

04:10:21.960 --> 04:10:22.760
sells nothing.

04:10:23.120 --> 04:10:24.440
The revenue will be zero.

04:10:25.200 --> 04:10:27.120
It will save on variable

04:10:27.130 --> 04:10:28.340
costs.

04:10:28.520 --> 04:10:30.320
With zero output, the variable

04:10:30.330 --> 04:10:31.920
costs, as you can see, are also zero.

04:10:32.660 --> 04:10:34.980
But the constant costs will still have

04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.860
to be borne.

04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:43.690
This means that the company’s losses will

04:10:43.700 --> 04:10:44.590
be greater.

04:10:45.610 --> 04:10:49.470
And if we close, the company's loss will

04:10:49.480 --> 04:10:51.870
be equal to the constant costs.

04:10:52.170 --> 04:10:56.330
This is reflected in the last column.

04:10:57.410 --> 04:11:00.010
In case of zero-issue, the profit of the company

04:11:00.020 --> 04:11:00.970
is minus 60.

04:11:01.770 --> 04:11:03.930
That is, the company is losing

04:11:03.940 --> 04:11:07.250
60 rubles, and this loss is exactly

04:11:07.260 --> 04:11:10.150
equal to constant costs.

04:11:14.360 --> 04:11:18.680
Well, if it is all not very

04:11:18.690 --> 04:11:21.540
clear, I will try to give this

04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:23.260
practical example.

04:11:27.200 --> 04:11:29.840
Well, you probably know that

04:11:29.850 --> 04:11:33.340
our country is now bathing in oil dollars.

04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:39.450
The price of our oil brand "Jurls"

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:42.810
is above $ 60 per barrel.

04:11:43.230 --> 04:11:47.010
It is hard to believe now, but in the

04:11:47.020 --> 04:11:51.090
98th year, the average annual

04:11:51.100 --> 04:11:54.950
price of our oil, the world price

04:11:54.960 --> 04:11:57.370
was about $11 per barrel.

04:11:59.250 --> 04:12:03.390
At such a low price, many of our oil

04:12:03.400 --> 04:12:06.650
companies suffered losses.

04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:11.230
But they did not close.

04:12:14.130 --> 04:12:14.670
Why is?

04:12:16.190 --> 04:12:20.030
Because in the short term

04:12:20.040 --> 04:12:23.410
there are constant costs

04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:26.830
that cannot be avoided.

04:12:27.790 --> 04:12:29.810
And if the companies closed our oil

04:12:29.820 --> 04:12:31.650
companies, they would be moving to pump oil.

04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:34.130
They would lose revenue,

04:12:34.430 --> 04:12:36.570
save on variable costs.

04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:40.010
But in the oil tank there is a large

04:12:40.020 --> 04:12:42.670
amount of constant costs that

04:12:42.680 --> 04:12:44.370
must be borne regardless

04:12:44.380 --> 04:12:46.270
of whether you produce something

04:12:46.280 --> 04:12:47.590
or nothing.

04:12:47.890 --> 04:12:50.270
In this case, the losses would be

04:12:50.280 --> 04:12:51.210
even greater.

04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:54.730
This is reflected in my conditional

04:12:54.740 --> 04:12:57.170
number example.

04:13:00.930 --> 04:13:04.050
I tried to show the same thing

04:13:04.060 --> 04:13:06.650
in the painting.

04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:09.430
Look at the next slide.

04:13:10.150 --> 04:13:13.390
What is the optimal edition?

04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:15.550
Let us go back to the

04:13:15.560 --> 04:13:18.110
previous slide.

04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:21.830
The optimal output is 7.

04:13:22.470 --> 04:13:26.130
At issue 7, the company's loss

04:13:26.140 --> 04:13:27.490
is minimal, that is, the

04:13:27.500 --> 04:13:29.550
profit is as much as possible.

04:13:30.730 --> 04:13:33.330
What is the revenue with this volume

04:13:33.340 --> 04:13:34.310
of release?

04:13:35.810 --> 04:13:37.190
168 is

04:13:38.490 --> 04:13:41.890
What are the total costs of this

04:13:41.900 --> 04:13:43.550
volume of release at issue

04:13:43.560 --> 04:13:44.350
7?

04:13:45.090 --> 04:13:45.770
See also.

04:13:47.360 --> 04:13:51.120
Column TC, total cost, total cost.

04:13:51.160 --> 04:13:52.520
184 is

04:13:53.400 --> 04:13:55.140
So what do we observe?

04:13:58.630 --> 04:14:00.870
That we have the total cost,

04:14:00.880 --> 04:14:03.290
I said, exceed the revenue, we

04:14:03.300 --> 04:14:04.690
are losing.

04:14:08.020 --> 04:14:10.980
What are the variable costs of the 7th

04:14:10.990 --> 04:14:11.800
edition?

04:14:12.220 --> 04:14:13.900
124. the

04:14:14.700 --> 04:14:15.700
What are we watching?

04:14:16.460 --> 04:14:19.680
The revenue does not cover

04:14:19.690 --> 04:14:21.000
the total cost.

04:14:21.010 --> 04:14:21.460
This is yes.

04:14:21.470 --> 04:14:24.840
It covers variable costs

04:14:24.850 --> 04:14:27.840
and partly covers fixed costs.

04:14:28.380 --> 04:14:30.260
Look at the painting.

04:14:32.020 --> 04:14:33.720
In the best case, what is

04:14:33.730 --> 04:14:34.480
our income?

04:14:36.910 --> 04:14:38.370
168 is

04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:42.350
Total costs are 184.

04:14:42.770 --> 04:14:45.130
Variable costs of 124.

04:14:45.410 --> 04:14:46.690
The permanent 60.

04:14:46.970 --> 04:14:47.910
They are always 60.

04:14:50.020 --> 04:14:52.300
Here we see that revenue

04:14:52.310 --> 04:14:55.660
covers variable costs and partially

04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:57.720
covers fixed costs.

04:15:00.680 --> 04:15:02.200
If we stopped the production,

04:15:03.060 --> 04:15:04.620
we would lose revenue, save

04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:07.260
on variables, and suffer even more

04:15:07.270 --> 04:15:11.120
losses in the amount of all

04:15:11.130 --> 04:15:12.360
the constant costs.

04:15:17.410 --> 04:15:23.530
When will the company leave the market,

04:15:23.540 --> 04:15:25.370
even in a short period of time?

04:15:28.360 --> 04:15:29.040
Here is when.

04:15:29.480 --> 04:15:31.960
Look at the next slide.

04:15:32.440 --> 04:15:36.680
When the price falls to such

04:15:36.690 --> 04:15:40.640
a low level that revenue with optimal

04:15:40.650 --> 04:15:43.640
output will not even cover

04:15:43.650 --> 04:15:44.960
the variable costs.

04:15:47.290 --> 04:15:49.970
There is no point in staying

04:15:49.980 --> 04:15:51.910
on the market and continuing production

04:15:51.920 --> 04:15:53.110
in a short period of time.

04:15:53.810 --> 04:15:55.010
I have to stop publishing.

04:15:55.850 --> 04:15:58.270
We will lose revenue, but we will

04:15:58.280 --> 04:16:00.230
save on variable costs and the

04:16:00.240 --> 04:16:02.370
loss will be still less than

04:16:02.380 --> 04:16:03.570
if we stay on the market.

04:16:06.080 --> 04:16:09.080
Now I try to depict it all,

04:16:09.090 --> 04:16:13.780
to show it all in the graphs.

04:16:18.500 --> 04:16:19.460
See also.

04:16:21.490 --> 04:16:23.750
The cost functions are traditional.

04:16:25.850 --> 04:16:27.310
As it was, it is all left.

04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:28.770
There is nothing new here.

04:16:40.020 --> 04:16:46.380
The price is equal to P1 at the beginning.

04:16:47.680 --> 04:16:49.580
Which issue does the company choose?

04:16:51.260 --> 04:16:52.160
Q1 is

04:16:53.520 --> 04:16:54.980
Why Q1?

04:16:55.320 --> 04:16:57.920
Because we remember the rules.

04:16:58.480 --> 04:17:01.580
Profit is maximum at such volume

04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:04.680
of production, at which the price

04:17:04.690 --> 04:17:07.860
or limit income is equal to

04:17:07.870 --> 04:17:09.920
the limit costs.

04:17:10.660 --> 04:17:12.580
The price is equal to the limit costs.

04:17:16.440 --> 04:17:18.580
Imagine that regardless of the will

04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:21.420
of the firm, a completely competitive

04:17:21.430 --> 04:17:22.740
firm does not affect the price,

04:17:22.750 --> 04:17:24.540
as we said, the price drops

04:17:24.820 --> 04:17:28.760
to the level of P2.

04:17:34.380 --> 04:17:37.400
Where is the issue where the

04:17:37.410 --> 04:17:38.540
profit is maximum?

04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:44.450
It is profit maximum always with such

04:17:44.460 --> 04:17:47.370
volume of production, where the price

04:17:47.380 --> 04:17:49.510
is equal to the limit costs.

04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:51.590
Where is this crossroads?

04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:56.430
The point is now E2 and Q2 release.

04:18:01.350 --> 04:18:06.450
But with this issue, the company

04:18:06.460 --> 04:18:09.570
no longer receives any economic profit.

04:18:15.190 --> 04:18:19.010
At this price and this issue, with this

04:18:19.020 --> 04:18:20.690
issue, it is better to say so, with

04:18:20.830 --> 04:18:24.770
Q2, the price is equal not only

04:18:24.780 --> 04:18:27.230
to the marginal costs, but also

04:18:27.240 --> 04:18:28.730
to the average total costs.

04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:29.790
Look carefully.

04:18:32.810 --> 04:18:34.710
Do you see the average total cost line?

04:18:36.270 --> 04:18:37.690
The AC line.

04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:41.090
The AC function decreases, then

04:18:41.100 --> 04:18:43.350
reaches the minimum to the E2 slurry.

04:18:47.430 --> 04:18:51.850
At the P2 price, the company does not

04:18:51.860 --> 04:18:52.710
get any profit.

04:18:52.930 --> 04:18:55.090
And no losses.

04:18:55.100 --> 04:18:57.030
The economic profit is zero.

04:18:58.790 --> 04:19:01.130
And if the price drops to P2, to

04:19:01.210 --> 04:19:03.830
P3, what are we now watching?

04:19:03.970 --> 04:19:08.150
For any volume of production, the price is below

04:19:08.160 --> 04:19:09.270
the average cost.

04:19:09.490 --> 04:19:11.310
Cost per unit of product.

04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:13.130
Losses are inevitable.

04:19:13.140 --> 04:19:15.030
But nevertheless, to minimize

04:19:15.040 --> 04:19:17.930
the loss, the company chooses

04:19:17.940 --> 04:19:21.710
the release always one where the

04:19:21.720 --> 04:19:25.090
P3 price is equal to the limit cost.

04:19:25.190 --> 04:19:26.990
This is Q3 release.

04:19:30.120 --> 04:19:32.840
The company is losing.

04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:38.550
It minimizes the loss at this point.

04:19:43.150 --> 04:19:45.790
But note what is important, when

04:19:48.940 --> 04:19:55.640
the price at the Q3 release

04:19:55.650 --> 04:19:58.440
price exceeds, look carefully,

04:19:59.260 --> 04:20:01.880
the average variable cost.

04:20:03.530 --> 04:20:05.030
Look carefully.

04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:09.830
When Q3 is released, we always

04:20:09.840 --> 04:20:13.270
have P3 price, and the AVC

04:20:13.280 --> 04:20:16.110
function is lower.

04:20:16.650 --> 04:20:19.910
This means that while remaining on

04:20:19.920 --> 04:20:24.530
the market, the firm partially covers

04:20:24.540 --> 04:20:26.850
variable costs and partially

04:20:26.860 --> 04:20:28.070
covers fixed costs.

04:20:28.390 --> 04:20:30.070
So it’s better to stay on the market.

04:20:30.250 --> 04:20:31.710
What I just told you.

04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:32.330
and above.

04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:37.290
If the price drops below P4,

04:20:37.450 --> 04:20:39.350
see what happens.

04:20:41.310 --> 04:20:45.510
If the price drops below P4, what

04:20:46.410 --> 04:20:48.010
will the price be?

04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:52.130
The minimum of the average variable cost.

04:20:52.690 --> 04:20:54.910
In this case, the company should close

04:20:54.920 --> 04:20:56.990
in a short period of time.

04:20:57.270 --> 04:21:00.570
The revenue will not only cover

04:21:00.580 --> 04:21:02.550
fixed, but also variable costs.

04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:05.950
Further production

04:21:05.960 --> 04:21:09.430
will only lead to losses.

04:21:12.440 --> 04:21:17.680
The E4 point is called the escape

04:21:17.690 --> 04:21:19.880
point in microeconomics.

04:21:20.900 --> 04:21:24.000
Point E4 is the minimum point of

04:21:24.010 --> 04:21:25.620
the average variable cost.

04:21:29.310 --> 04:21:33.090
If the price drops below, the revenue will

04:21:33.100 --> 04:21:34.510
not cover the variable costs.

04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:36.870
Must be closed.

04:21:38.010 --> 04:21:40.770
But I repeat, this is the theory of

04:21:40.780 --> 04:21:42.530
the company’s balance all – yet in a

04:21:42.540 --> 04:21:43.590
short period of time.

04:21:45.700 --> 04:21:48.560
Once again, if the price is, for

04:21:48.570 --> 04:21:52.860
example, P3, the company will

04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:54.220
be losing.

04:21:54.520 --> 04:21:56.140
But in a short time, it will remain

04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.980
on the market.

04:21:57.160 --> 04:21:59.000
Otherwise, the losses will be even greater,

04:21:59.280 --> 04:22:01.800
because there are constant costs that

04:22:02.360 --> 04:22:04.600
cannot be avoided in a short

04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:06.780
period of time.

04:22:10.390 --> 04:22:12.590
What is the difference between a long period

04:22:12.600 --> 04:22:13.670
and a short period?

04:22:16.180 --> 04:22:20.020
In the long run, all costs

04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:21.360
can be revised.

04:22:22.840 --> 04:22:25.660
For example, in the short term,

04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:27.560
the lease contract cannot be

04:22:27.570 --> 04:22:28.000
revised.

04:22:28.280 --> 04:22:30.880
Rental is a constant cost.

04:22:32.240 --> 04:22:33.920
The rent is covered by contract.

04:22:33.960 --> 04:22:35.220
The rent cannot be avoided.

04:22:36.040 --> 04:22:37.600
What can we do in the long run?

04:22:39.120 --> 04:22:40.720
To give up this lease,

04:22:40.730 --> 04:22:42.880
re-conclude, change the

04:22:42.890 --> 04:22:44.740
lease contract, find some

04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:47.120
other room, try to

04:22:47.130 --> 04:22:50.460
optimize costs.

04:22:50.760 --> 04:22:53.920
Therefore, in the long term, the company

04:22:53.930 --> 04:22:57.800
receiving a loss from the market will, of

04:22:57.810 --> 04:23:00.540
course, come out.

04:23:00.960 --> 04:23:05.380
If not, change the cost.

04:23:05.420 --> 04:23:06.940
For example, a more profitable rental

04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:07.800
contract.

04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:14.210
Now to the fourth question.

04:23:16.320 --> 04:23:18.480
We have talked with you about the

04:23:18.490 --> 04:23:21.760
balance of a completely competitive company.

04:23:22.360 --> 04:23:26.410
Now let’s talk about how the

04:23:26.420 --> 04:23:30.310
balance of a company with

04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:33.270
monopoly power is achieved.

04:23:36.090 --> 04:23:38.110
I remind you.

04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:41.410
A company with a monopoly power

04:23:41.420 --> 04:23:45.590
can control the price within certain

04:23:45.600 --> 04:23:46.810
limits.

04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:52.610
It can set a higher price.

04:23:53.290 --> 04:23:54.730
But then it will face a fall in

04:23:54.740 --> 04:23:55.890
demand for its products.

04:23:56.490 --> 04:23:58.210
It can set the price lower, the demand

04:23:58.590 --> 04:24:00.310
for its products will increase.

04:24:01.110 --> 04:24:05.190
So what is the task of a monopoly?

04:24:05.200 --> 04:24:11.730
The monopoly is a price maker, a price-seeker.

04:24:12.350 --> 04:24:16.490
Its task is to set such a price, respectively,

04:24:16.730 --> 04:24:17.890
to choose such a volume of

04:24:17.900 --> 04:24:21.050
release, in which its profit

04:24:21.060 --> 04:24:24.170
will be maximum.

04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:30.770
The general rule of profit maximization.

04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:35.010
Profit is maximum when the limit

04:24:35.020 --> 04:24:38.210
income is equal to the limit

04:24:38.220 --> 04:24:41.050
cost, this rule is universal.

04:24:41.850 --> 04:24:44.690
It is true for any firm, even if it is completely

04:24:44.700 --> 04:24:46.610
competitive, even if it is a monopoly,

04:24:46.620 --> 04:24:48.610
even if it is an origopolis, even if

04:24:48.620 --> 04:24:49.470
it is anyone.

04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:54.070
The profit of any company is maximum

04:24:54.080 --> 04:24:59.390
when its limit income is equal

04:24:59.400 --> 04:25:01.890
to the limit costs at this volume

04:25:01.900 --> 04:25:03.070
of production.

04:25:05.840 --> 04:25:07.460
Here, the monopoly brings nothing

04:25:07.470 --> 04:25:09.180
new compared to a completely

04:25:09.190 --> 04:25:10.180
competitive firm.

04:25:12.010 --> 04:25:14.690
But there is an important difference.

04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:17.270
Remember, I said that in a completely

04:25:17.280 --> 04:25:19.970
competitive firm the limit income

04:25:19.980 --> 04:25:23.490
is equal to the price of the commodity.

04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:27.330
The monopoly has nothing like that.

04:25:29.110 --> 04:25:32.690
The monopolist’s marginal income

04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:39.250
is always less than the price at which

04:25:39.260 --> 04:25:42.190
the monopolist sells his products.

04:25:43.940 --> 04:25:45.660
This is what needs to be solved.

04:25:47.620 --> 04:25:50.960
Let us take the simplest conditional

04:25:50.970 --> 04:25:55.020
function of demand for the monopoly product.

04:26:10.330 --> 04:26:13.410
P is 10 minus Q.

04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:18.850
P is the price, Q is the demand.

04:26:19.050 --> 04:26:20.870
What are we watching?

04:26:21.250 --> 04:26:24.170
The higher the price, the lower

04:26:24.180 --> 04:26:27.050
the demand.

04:26:28.810 --> 04:26:33.670
Here is this function, the data taken from

04:26:33.680 --> 04:26:37.110
this function I transferred to the table.

04:26:37.120 --> 04:26:39.070
Please look at the slide.

04:26:41.790 --> 04:26:46.430
Well, see, at the price of 10, let’s say,

04:26:46.570 --> 04:26:49.230
put a tenth here, the amount of demand

04:26:49.240 --> 04:26:50.410
will be what?

04:26:51.130 --> 04:26:51.430
and zero.

04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.670
Okay no?

04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:56.390
At the price of 9, if we place

04:26:56.400 --> 04:26:58.750
the nine, the demand will be

04:26:58.760 --> 04:26:59.930
one and so on.

04:27:00.210 --> 04:27:02.270
So, what does the first line

04:27:02.280 --> 04:27:03.630
contain?

04:27:04.390 --> 04:27:06.050
All possible prices for the monopoly

04:27:06.060 --> 04:27:07.430
product from 10 to 0.

04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:11.290
The second line contains all

04:27:11.300 --> 04:27:14.190
possible values of demand at a particular

04:27:14.200 --> 04:27:15.910
price.

04:27:16.170 --> 04:27:16.770
Of course yes?

04:27:17.710 --> 04:27:21.010
The third line contains what?

04:27:23.930 --> 04:27:27.290
Monopoly at different prices.

04:27:29.250 --> 04:27:31.130
I hope you remember that revenue is

04:27:31.140 --> 04:27:35.850
a product of the price on the volume

04:27:35.860 --> 04:27:37.570
of demand.

04:27:37.890 --> 04:27:41.210
So at the price of 0 we can not

04:27:41.220 --> 04:27:42.730
sell a single unit of the goods,

04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:44.150
respectively, the revenue is 0.

04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:46.510
At the price of 9 we can sell one unit

04:27:46.520 --> 04:27:48.790
of the goods of the monopoly.

04:27:49.150 --> 04:27:51.330
9 and so on.

04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:53.470
and so on.

04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:56.610
I would like to reiterate

04:27:56.620 --> 04:27:59.510
that monopoly cannot abolish

04:27:59.520 --> 04:28:01.730
the laws of demand.

04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:03.850
No matter what monopoly I am, at a certain

04:28:03.860 --> 04:28:06.010
price, the demand for my products

04:28:06.020 --> 04:28:07.210
will fall to zero.

04:28:11.720 --> 04:28:14.940
Well, so what are we watching?

04:28:15.360 --> 04:28:17.260
What is our revenue?

04:28:17.980 --> 04:28:21.500
First it increases, then at the price

04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:28.840
of 5 reaches a maximum of 25,

04:28:28.850 --> 04:28:31.780
and then revenue begins to decrease.

04:28:35.620 --> 04:28:38.740
Now let us calculate

04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:41.580
the monopoly income.

04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:46.490
The limit income formula is

04:28:46.500 --> 04:28:47.550
clearly known.

04:29:08.600 --> 04:29:11.140
The limit income is equal to the increase

04:29:11.150 --> 04:29:16.500
in revenue divided by the increase

04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:18.160
in output.

04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:27.510
First, we set the

04:29:27.520 --> 04:29:30.010
price 10.

04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:35.590
And no one bought anything from us.

04:29:35.850 --> 04:29:40.190
Then set the price 9 and bought

04:29:40.200 --> 04:29:42.330
one unit of products.

04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:44.590
How much has the revenue increased?

04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:48.250
From zero to nine, that is, by nine.

04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:54.370
Delta TR 9 is equal to the delta of the unit.

04:29:54.690 --> 04:29:57.730
The maximum income is 9.

04:30:01.470 --> 04:30:03.890
Only in this case would

04:30:03.900 --> 04:30:06.470
the limit income be better,

04:30:06.480 --> 04:30:08.130
more correct.

04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:11.950
Not put under the unit, not under

04:30:11.960 --> 04:30:15.310
issue 1, look at the slide, but as

04:30:15.320 --> 04:30:18.230
if when moving from issue 0 to

04:30:18.240 --> 04:30:19.210
issue 1.

04:30:20.430 --> 04:30:23.550
That is, it is the conversion of revenue

04:30:23.560 --> 04:30:27.450
when the output increases from 0 to one.

04:30:27.570 --> 04:30:28.870
Looking forward.

04:30:31.350 --> 04:30:34.090
When we get the 1st edition, what is the revenue?

04:30:34.150 --> 04:30:36.890
9 and at issue 2 is 16.

04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:40.030
So when the output increases by one

04:30:40.040 --> 04:30:42.510
unit from one to two, the revenue

04:30:42.520 --> 04:30:47.650
increases from 9 to 16, that

04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:48.790
is, by 7.

04:30:48.800 --> 04:30:51.170
Accordingly, the limit income

04:30:51.180 --> 04:30:53.230
when moving from issue 1

04:30:53.240 --> 04:30:57.230
to issue 2 is 7 and so on.

04:30:58.450 --> 04:31:01.170
So I filled out the last line,

04:31:01.180 --> 04:31:04.350
which contains data on the change

04:31:04.360 --> 04:31:06.810
in the limit income.

04:31:11.430 --> 04:31:12.170
well well.

04:31:17.440 --> 04:31:22.320
And now let’s set any volume

04:31:22.330 --> 04:31:25.320
of release from those shown

04:31:25.330 --> 04:31:27.980
here on our slide.

04:31:30.280 --> 04:31:32.520
Let’s say, issue 3.

04:31:37.060 --> 04:31:40.480
What price do I need to set to

04:31:40.490 --> 04:31:42.640
sell 3 units of products?

04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:47.330
Look at the first line.

04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:50.230
To sell three units of products, the

04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:53.130
monopoly must set a price of 7.

04:31:54.350 --> 04:31:59.130
What is the limit income in

04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:03.770
issue 3?

04:32:04.890 --> 04:32:07.330
Look, he will be between, look

04:32:07.340 --> 04:32:09.810
at the last line, he will be

04:32:09.820 --> 04:32:11.550
between 5 and 3.

04:32:12.530 --> 04:32:13.970
It can be rigorously proven

04:32:13.980 --> 04:32:16.530
mathematically that at issue 3 the

04:32:16.540 --> 04:32:18.870
limit income will be equal to 4.

04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:23.190
So, when the issue of 3 is the price of

04:32:23.200 --> 04:32:24.990
7, and the monopoly's limit income is only 4.

04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:28.670
The monopoly’s marginal income is less than the price.

04:32:32.050 --> 04:32:34.690
Okay, I will give you another volume.

04:32:35.290 --> 04:32:37.230
Let’s say there are 5.

04:32:37.470 --> 04:32:38.350
Go to 5.

04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:39.370
Let it 5.

04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:42.130
What is the price of 5?

04:32:42.270 --> 04:32:43.770
What price does a monopoly have

04:32:43.780 --> 04:32:46.910
to set to sell five units of goods?

04:32:48.030 --> 04:32:48.830
The price 5.

04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:51.410
What is the limit income in

04:32:51.420 --> 04:32:52.010
issue 5?

04:32:52.490 --> 04:32:53.870
Look at the last line.

04:32:54.150 --> 04:32:56.330
between a unit and a minus.

04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:58.610
It can be strictly proven that when

04:32:58.620 --> 04:33:00.650
issuing 5 the limit income is equal to 0.

04:33:00.660 --> 04:33:05.210
The price is above the limit income.

04:33:06.640 --> 04:33:08.300
Why am I leading all this?

04:33:08.880 --> 04:33:12.440
I am trying to explain here that in a completely

04:33:12.450 --> 04:33:15.180
competitive firm the marginal income,

04:33:19.680 --> 04:33:22.960
remember, was always equal to the

04:33:22.970 --> 04:33:25.080
price of the commodity.

04:33:25.580 --> 04:33:30.060
And the monopolist has a limit income at any

04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:35.140
volume of production less than the price

04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:36.340
of the goods.

04:33:40.800 --> 04:33:43.760
I strongly suspect that this is my explanation,

04:33:43.770 --> 04:33:49.020
it seems to be too mathematically

04:33:49.030 --> 04:33:50.800
explained, or not.

04:33:51.340 --> 04:33:52.780
It seems that yes, according to

04:33:52.790 --> 04:33:55.740
the numbers, against the numbers like you can’t stop.

04:33:56.900 --> 04:33:59.440
But I would like you to understand

04:34:01.640 --> 04:34:05.290
this logically.

04:34:09.530 --> 04:34:11.750
Why does a monopolist have a marginal

04:34:13.540 --> 04:34:15.950
income always lower than the price of

04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:17.770
the goods at which he sells his products?

04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:19.210
What is the matter here?

04:34:23.920 --> 04:34:24.840
Let us give such an example.

04:34:25.880 --> 04:34:25.880
well well.

04:34:26.140 --> 04:34:27.120
I will try this way.

04:34:27.360 --> 04:34:28.480
A very conditional example.

04:34:29.580 --> 04:34:33.860
I am a monopolist of selling beer

04:34:33.870 --> 04:34:35.560
in this city.

04:34:35.740 --> 04:34:37.640
I sell beer alone.

04:34:37.650 --> 04:34:39.980
I will not let anyone else into this market.

04:34:40.320 --> 04:34:41.760
I am the only seller.

04:34:42.420 --> 04:34:46.360
I am very willing to

04:34:46.370 --> 04:34:47.700
buy beer, please.

04:34:50.040 --> 04:34:52.720
As soon as I become a monopolist, I begin to

04:34:52.730 --> 04:34:53.640
play with the price.

04:34:56.640 --> 04:34:58.960
On the first day of sale, I set the price

04:34:58.970 --> 04:35:02.280
of 10 rubles for a bottle of beer.

04:35:02.700 --> 04:35:03.980
How many beer have I bought?

04:35:04.780 --> 04:35:06.360
Look at the table.

04:35:06.680 --> 04:35:06.960
and zero.

04:35:07.720 --> 04:35:09.840
No customer has come to me at

04:35:09.850 --> 04:35:10.720
this price.

04:35:10.920 --> 04:35:12.060
The price is too high.

04:35:13.520 --> 04:35:14.060
well well.

04:35:15.300 --> 04:35:19.220
I start to lower prices, I have nowhere to go.

04:35:19.820 --> 04:35:22.920
The next day I set the price 9.

04:35:23.180 --> 04:35:25.120
How many beer have I bought?

04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:28.750
One bottle.

04:35:29.550 --> 04:35:30.670
Who came to me?

04:35:31.290 --> 04:35:34.190
Or the richest person, or

04:35:34.200 --> 04:35:36.250
the biggest beer lover in this city.

04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:38.370
At the price of 9 I sold one bottle.

04:35:40.400 --> 04:35:41.480
Let me not be pleased.

04:35:42.320 --> 04:35:45.340
The next day I set the price of 8 rubles

04:35:45.350 --> 04:35:47.560
for a bottle of beer.

04:35:50.380 --> 04:35:54.500
The one who bought 9 rubles,

04:35:54.510 --> 04:35:59.100
8 will buy, even with great pleasure.

04:35:59.520 --> 04:36:01.140
Who will come to me?

04:36:03.130 --> 04:36:05.750
There will be a second beer lover,

04:36:05.760 --> 04:36:07.070
for whom the price of 9 rubles

04:36:07.080 --> 04:36:09.170
was too high, and 8 is right.

04:36:10.790 --> 04:36:13.270
So what does it work out?

04:36:13.730 --> 04:36:16.230
At the price of 8 I have already sold two bottles.

04:36:19.530 --> 04:36:21.710
And now tell me, please, how much

04:36:24.790 --> 04:36:28.630
money the second beer lover

04:36:28.640 --> 04:36:30.810
brought me today,

04:36:30.820 --> 04:36:32.750
the extra money he didn’t bring

04:36:32.760 --> 04:36:34.690
me yesterday.

04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:39.850
He brought me nothing yesterday.

04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:43.730
I bought a beer for 8 rubles.

04:36:44.590 --> 04:36:47.170
So I got an extra 8 rubles

04:36:47.180 --> 04:36:49.190
from him, which I didn’t get

04:36:49.200 --> 04:36:50.330
yesterday.

04:36:54.840 --> 04:36:55.700
It is good.

04:36:56.320 --> 04:36:57.020
What is bad?

04:36:58.400 --> 04:37:00.780
I lost the ruble on the first buyer.

04:37:02.550 --> 04:37:05.890
I bought it for 9 days and now it’s

04:37:05.900 --> 04:37:07.630
the same price for everyone.

04:37:08.710 --> 04:37:09.770
The price is always the same.

04:37:10.970 --> 04:37:12.210
Well, at least in my model, the price is

04:37:12.220 --> 04:37:13.730
the same for everyone.

04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:17.610
So the second buyer brought, on the

04:37:17.650 --> 04:37:18.870
second buyer I won 8 rubles, and

04:37:18.880 --> 04:37:21.730
on the first I lost a ruble.

04:37:22.170 --> 04:37:25.130
So it turned out that the increase

04:37:25.140 --> 04:37:27.670
in revenue was not the price, the price

04:37:27.680 --> 04:37:32.210
now is 8, and the marginal buyer, it

04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:36.190
is understandable why, in fact,

04:37:38.580 --> 04:37:40.010
the marginal buyer is less than

04:37:40.020 --> 04:37:40.870
the price?

04:37:41.770 --> 04:37:45.290
Because when we lower the

04:37:47.550 --> 04:37:52.650
price, we lose on those

04:37:53.030 --> 04:37:55.190
buyers who could buy the

04:37:55.200 --> 04:37:57.130
goods at a higher

04:37:57.140 --> 04:37:58.870
price.

04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.710
Again once again.

04:38:00.270 --> 04:38:02.030
On the second buyer I won 8 rubles,

04:38:02.040 --> 04:38:03.970
he brought me 8 rubles today,

04:38:03.980 --> 04:38:05.530
which yesterday did not bring me.

04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:08.830
But the first one brought me yesterday

04:38:09.110 --> 04:38:11.270
9 and today he brought only 8, I

04:38:11.280 --> 04:38:12.970
sell 8 rubles of beer.

04:38:13.170 --> 04:38:14.110
So I lost the first ruble,

04:38:14.120 --> 04:38:15.710
and I won the second 8.

04:38:16.210 --> 04:38:18.130
The total limit income is

04:38:18.140 --> 04:38:19.010
only 7.

04:38:19.970 --> 04:38:22.350
The price is above the limit income.

04:38:25.740 --> 04:38:29.160
And it can be strictly proved, I do not

04:38:29.170 --> 04:38:30.180
use higher mathematics, but simply

04:38:30.200 --> 04:38:30.940
standing on my fingers to explain,

04:38:30.950 --> 04:38:34.640
it can be strictly proved that if the demand

04:38:34.940 --> 04:38:38.920
function is nine, the function of the

04:38:39.020 --> 04:38:40.980
monopolist's limit income is also

04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:43.540
linear, and its inclination is twice

04:38:43.550 --> 04:38:46.180
the inclination of the demand

04:38:47.960 --> 04:38:50.570
function, the prileasing function

04:38:50.580 --> 04:38:51.630
of demand.

04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:55.690
The margin income function is also linear,

04:38:55.700 --> 04:38:58.330
written on a slide, and its slope

04:38:58.340 --> 04:39:02.190
is twice the slope of the demand curve.

04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:03.590
Here, we see that.

04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:05.290
See the demand function.

04:39:05.330 --> 04:39:07.910
Do you see the limit income function?

04:39:07.920 --> 04:39:09.850
The function of the limit income is twice

04:39:09.860 --> 04:39:12.450
as fast as the function of demand.

04:39:12.990 --> 04:39:15.810
Its inclination is twice as much.

04:39:17.940 --> 04:39:19.260
Well, and now let’s see with

04:39:22.170 --> 04:39:24.600
you how you can show on the

04:39:24.610 --> 04:39:28.300
chart of achieving monopoly balance.

04:39:30.240 --> 04:39:31.360
Here what do we see?

04:39:32.100 --> 04:39:34.160
linear function of demand.

04:39:36.500 --> 04:39:39.560
On the other hand, we see the function

04:39:39.570 --> 04:39:40.480
of the limit income.

04:39:41.770 --> 04:39:43.730
The function of the limit income has, as

04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:45.450
I have said, a twice greater inclination

04:39:45.460 --> 04:39:47.790
than the function of the demand for

04:39:47.800 --> 04:39:49.490
the monopoly product.

04:39:49.770 --> 04:39:53.250
And I also put on this picture the functions,

04:39:53.260 --> 04:39:55.870
the classic functions of the marginal

04:39:55.880 --> 04:39:59.190
and average income of the monopolist.

04:39:59.290 --> 04:40:01.530
Excusions, the marginal costs

04:40:01.540 --> 04:40:04.070
of the monopoly and its average

04:40:04.080 --> 04:40:05.110
total costs.

04:40:05.490 --> 04:40:07.670
The function of the marginal,

04:40:07.680 --> 04:40:09.810
I repeat, and the average total cost

04:40:09.820 --> 04:40:11.050
of the monopoly.

04:40:14.710 --> 04:40:17.270
The rules, I said, are always one.

04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:21.090
Profit is maximum at such volume

04:40:21.100 --> 04:40:24.970
of production, where the limit

04:40:26.940 --> 04:40:31.520
income is equal to the limit costs.

04:40:32.740 --> 04:40:37.060
Look at the schedule where we

04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:39.460
cross the functions of the limit

04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:40.740
income and the limit cost.

04:40:41.080 --> 04:40:42.260
You see the crossroads?

04:40:44.680 --> 04:40:49.360
This point determines the QM issue,

04:40:50.640 --> 04:40:54.300
in which the profit of the monopoly is maximum.

04:40:57.940 --> 04:41:00.960
What price will the monopoly pay?

04:41:02.730 --> 04:41:08.090
This price should be looked for on the function on

04:41:08.100 --> 04:41:10.190
the demand curve.

04:41:10.250 --> 04:41:12.750
See, we restore the perpendicular

04:41:12.850 --> 04:41:17.970
from the QM point up to the intersection

04:41:17.980 --> 04:41:21.010
with the demand function.

04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:24.110
And from there we lower the perpendicular to the

04:41:24.120 --> 04:41:25.590
Y axis, to the price axis.

04:41:27.250 --> 04:41:32.830
So, in order to sell QM goods,

04:41:33.330 --> 04:41:35.750
the monopoly must set the PM price

04:41:35.760 --> 04:41:37.850
for its products.

04:41:40.490 --> 04:41:44.210
At this price and such volume of

04:41:44.220 --> 04:41:46.630
production and sales, the profit

04:41:46.640 --> 04:41:49.910
of the monopolist becomes maximum.

04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:53.970
And now finally, please,

04:41:54.790 --> 04:41:59.110
can you show the profit, the

04:41:59.120 --> 04:42:01.150
amount of monopoly profit

04:42:01.160 --> 04:42:02.690
on the chart?

04:42:04.960 --> 04:42:06.520
Well look at.

04:42:06.800 --> 04:42:08.640
What is profit, remember.

04:42:08.800 --> 04:42:09.520
It is easy.

04:42:10.260 --> 04:42:12.580
Profit is the difference between

04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:15.340
revenue and total costs.

04:42:18.460 --> 04:42:20.340
What is profit and revenue?

04:42:24.020 --> 04:42:29.180
This is the price multiplied by the volume of sales.

04:42:30.880 --> 04:42:34.260
So PM multiplied by QM.

04:42:34.520 --> 04:42:36.320
Graphically, this is the area

04:42:36.330 --> 04:42:43.780
of the rectangle O PM EQM.

04:42:47.340 --> 04:42:49.780
Where are the total costs?

04:42:51.720 --> 04:42:53.120
The total cost can be calculated

04:42:53.130 --> 04:42:56.360
by multiplying the average total

04:42:56.370 --> 04:42:59.280
cost again by the volume of

04:42:59.290 --> 04:43:00.520
production.

04:43:01.140 --> 04:43:04.680
If so, then the average total

04:43:04.690 --> 04:43:08.140
cost is equal to the area of the

04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:15.960
rectangle O C FQM.

04:43:17.710 --> 04:43:19.130
That is, it is the area of the

04:43:21.540 --> 04:43:23.810
lower rectangle, and how do we get the profit?

04:43:23.950 --> 04:43:24.930
From the area of the

04:43:24.940 --> 04:43:26.170
upper rectangle, we deduct the area

04:43:26.180 --> 04:43:27.510
of the lower rectangle.

04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:28.610
Accordingly, the profit of the

04:43:28.620 --> 04:43:30.630
monopoly is equal to the area

04:43:30.640 --> 04:43:35.690
of the rectangle C PM E F.

04:43:42.240 --> 04:43:44.760
And a very important conclusion that

04:43:44.770 --> 04:43:46.300
follows from all this.

04:43:46.980 --> 04:43:49.240
Let us remember the perfect competition.

04:43:54.900 --> 04:43:58.980
In perfect competition, the price

04:43:58.990 --> 04:44:01.280
at which the company sells its

04:44:03.250 --> 04:44:06.140
products becomes equal to

04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:09.340
its limit costs at the

04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:11.460
point of balance.

04:44:11.520 --> 04:44:16.020
There is the equation P equal to MC.

04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:20.530
And in the conditions of monopoly domination,

04:44:21.930 --> 04:44:24.310
the monopoly sets a price, look

04:44:26.440 --> 04:44:28.770
at the figure, above the

04:44:28.780 --> 04:44:30.030
limit costs.

04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:32.670
See you?

04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:36.610
The demand line is above the limit

04:44:36.620 --> 04:44:37.650
cost curve.

04:44:40.300 --> 04:44:43.460
The monopoly’s limit costs at the QM issue

04:44:43.470 --> 04:44:46.320
are equal to the OC segment.

04:44:47.640 --> 04:44:50.060
The price of the monopolist, the price that the

04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:52.140
monopolist has set, is equal to the

04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:53.440
OPM segment.

04:44:55.080 --> 04:44:56.780
So, I repeat, the monopoly

04:44:56.960 --> 04:44:58.360
sets a price that exceeds

04:44:58.380 --> 04:45:00.400
the limit costs.

04:45:01.820 --> 04:45:05.200
And hence the most important conclusion is that

04:45:05.210 --> 04:45:13.040
monopolies are able to overpriced the price and underestimate

04:45:13.050 --> 04:45:15.000
the volume of production.

04:45:15.560 --> 04:45:18.280
In the conditions of monopoly power, the

04:45:18.540 --> 04:45:23.220
price is higher and the output is lower

04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:26.600
than in the conditions of competition.

04:45:27.980 --> 04:45:32.960
This is the main claim of society

04:45:32.970 --> 04:45:34.160
to monopoly.

04:45:36.020 --> 04:45:41.060
Monopolies overpriced the price and underestimated

04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:42.820
the volume of production compared to the

04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:44.660
volume of production that would have been

04:45:44.670 --> 04:45:46.580
made if it had had had instead of the

04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:47.660
monopoly competition.

04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:52.490
This is the main basis

04:45:52.500 --> 04:45:55.790
for antimonopoly

04:45:55.800 --> 04:45:57.870
policy.

04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:04.290
Antimonopoly policy is a policy

04:46:04.300 --> 04:46:07.170
of promoting competition.

04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:13.050
In the West, anti-monopoly policy has

04:46:13.060 --> 04:46:18.590
more than a century of experience.

04:46:19.290 --> 04:46:21.530
The first anti-monopoly law in the

04:46:21.540 --> 04:46:23.510
United States, if I am not mistaken,

04:46:23.520 --> 04:46:25.970
was passed in the 1990s of the

04:46:25.980 --> 04:46:28.390
19th century.

04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:32.410
We are in Russia 100 years later.

04:46:33.370 --> 04:46:35.970
Details about the anti-monopoly

04:46:35.980 --> 04:46:40.210
policy are stated in the text of

04:46:40.220 --> 04:46:42.410
this lecture, attached to this

04:46:42.420 --> 04:46:44.150
visual course.

04:46:44.690 --> 04:46:49.310
I will say two words literally that

04:46:49.320 --> 04:46:52.170
antimonopoly policy is a policy

04:46:52.180 --> 04:46:55.270
of promoting competition.

04:46:56.670 --> 04:46:58.390
It is for this it is directed.

04:47:01.780 --> 04:47:05.500
In Russia, a new anti-monopoly

04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:07.680
law has been adopted.

04:47:07.900 --> 04:47:11.320
In 2006, the Competition Protection

04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:12.760
Act was adopted.

04:47:13.360 --> 04:47:16.080
A very useful law contains

04:47:16.090 --> 04:47:18.020
many interesting provisions,

04:47:18.030 --> 04:47:20.500
new provisions that aim to

04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:22.200
prevent monopoly

04:47:22.210 --> 04:47:24.320
domination in the markets.

04:47:28.090 --> 04:47:31.690
But on the other hand, our policy in

04:47:31.700 --> 04:47:33.910
Russia, the policy of the Russian

04:47:33.920 --> 04:47:36.050
government, in this sense, is

04:47:36.060 --> 04:47:37.570
at least ambiguous.

04:47:38.490 --> 04:47:41.670
On the one hand, a very useful anti-

04:47:41.680 --> 04:47:43.910
monopoly law is being adopted.

04:47:45.130 --> 04:47:50.770
More and more large companies

04:47:50.780 --> 04:47:53.650
are being created under

04:47:53.660 --> 04:47:55.410
state control.

04:47:57.060 --> 04:48:00.020
The so-called national champions.

04:48:03.340 --> 04:48:06.380
On the one hand, we are fighting against monopoly.

04:48:06.540 --> 04:48:10.540
On the other hand, we are developing monopoly.

04:48:12.120 --> 04:48:15.240
Rosoboronexport is pulling in its

04:48:15.250 --> 04:48:16.200
entire orbit.

04:48:16.210 --> 04:48:18.300
All new and new enterprises

04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:23.360
form holdings under their control.

04:48:23.660 --> 04:48:26.760
The same is happening in aviation.

04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:30.230
I repeat, you will read more about this

04:48:30.240 --> 04:48:32.810
in the text of the lecture.

04:48:36.130 --> 04:48:39.250
I would only like to be careful

04:48:39.260 --> 04:48:42.650
to question the effectiveness of

04:48:42.660 --> 04:48:43.910
such a policy.

04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:52.430
Most foreign experts and domestic

04:48:52.440 --> 04:48:55.230
experts believe that the policy

04:48:55.530 --> 04:48:58.770
of state support for large

04:48:58.780 --> 04:49:03.930
companies will only lead

04:49:03.940 --> 04:49:06.450
to the fact that these companies

04:49:06.460 --> 04:49:09.510
will become ineffective.

04:49:10.090 --> 04:49:11.870
State support, lack of

04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:14.490
competition will kill business.

04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:19.490
Read more about this in the text

04:49:19.500 --> 04:49:20.910
of the lecture.
