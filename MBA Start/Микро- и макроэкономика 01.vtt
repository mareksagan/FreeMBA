WEBVTT

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.680
Ladies and gentlemen, good day.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.840
Let me introduce.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.660
I am Sergey Georgievich Searyakov,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.000
a professor of the All-Russian Academy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.220
Economic Development and Trade,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700
who has lived classes on cargo MBA

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.280
in our academy, as well as in the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.460
Academy of Economics under the Government

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.940
of the Russian Federation.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.240
We will discuss the issues

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.400
of micro- and macroeconomics.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.580
It is possible that many of you have

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.080
already faced such a science,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.420
which is called, well, it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.100
can be called differently.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.180
Most often, the economic theory, sometimes

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.360
economics, in the English-

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.280
language literature So, micro and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.640
macro economics are two components

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.600
of this science.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270
And again, if you have done this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.270
before, you know that economics

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910
theory is written in thick

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.310
textbooks, whole volumes.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.930
To recount all their content is not

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.930
possible, and you probably do not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.650
need it.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.110
So I decided on those questions

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.430
that can be interesting

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.130
and useful for you, as for people practical.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510
Therefore, I think my course is best

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.550
called economics for practitioners.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.350
They speak in the West managerial

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.210
economics or literal translation

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.310
of management economics.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.710
Please see what topics we

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
will address in this course.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.610
I would like to draw your attention that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.850
in addition to the lectures course

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030
you are offered a full printed

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570
course of lectures.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.370
It would be good to read this course.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.630
At the end of each topic you will

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.130
find a checkup.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.290
It would be good to resolve them.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.890
I recommend you pay special attention

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.010
to case studies, that is, to the analysis

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.410
of practical situations.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.230
Well, to complete this course

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.370
is probably the best solution

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.630
to a control test.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.470
I wish you success, let's start.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.860
So look again.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.780
The first is an introduction to economics.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.580
Two questions on this topic.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.640
The first is economics as a science.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.020
Well, the introductory topic, I will stop

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.680
on it very briefly.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880
And first of all, I would like

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000
to tell you what this is for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.660
science, economy, where it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.380
came from, how it arose.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.140
It arose from such a very simple

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540
contradiction.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
People's needs are limitless,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.300
and the resources they have

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.800
to meet these needs

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.520
are unfortunately limited.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.000
If this is the case, then there is a problem

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.620
of choice.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.100
A few basic examples.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.620
Here you come to the store.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300
No matter how rich you

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.940
are, the amount of money

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.040
you have is limited.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.540
But you will agree, you will

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.300
not buy just bread or only milk.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.060
What is your task?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.860
You need to buy some optimal

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.320
set of benefits for the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.840
limited amount of money you have.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.000
That is, the set

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.340
that best meets your

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.600
needs.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.900
That is, you solve a typical economic

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.200
problem associated with the problem

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.060
of choice.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.660
Or a firm.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.180
The company cannot produce everything.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.920
They also have limited resources.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.920
What is her task?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.940
The best way to use limited

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.060
resources is to get

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.180
maximum profit.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.500
The local authorities would like to build

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.120
a school, a road, and a hospital.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.540
Again, there are not enough resources.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.340
Again, we have to choose.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.420
So, how people, firms, society as

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.440
a whole make their choices in the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.100
context of limited resources,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.940
this is what economic theory

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.420
is dealing with.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.820
Please look at the following

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.760
slide.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.880
Object of Economy.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320
In fact, economics is studying.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.420
Here we look.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.800
Object of Economy.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.840
A decision taken in a society

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.660
when distributing limited

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.920
resources between

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.240
different uses to maximize

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.100
people's well-being.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.960
But that's what I've already told you.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.880
Economic theory is exactly what it deals

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.120
with, how people, firms, societies

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.440
as a whole make their choices in the

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.430
conditions of limited resources.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.750
Let us see further.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.250
The next slide.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.390
When you have to make a choice,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.090
you should answer three main questions.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.130
The first question.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.230
How much to produce?

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.890
The second.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.680
How to produce?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.780
The Third.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.620
For whom to produce?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.340
Again the simplest example.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.380
Local authorities.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.460
We would like to build a school, a road, a

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.020
hospital, all the resources are not enough.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.280
The first question they

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.720
have to answer.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.180
What to produce?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.180
well well.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.220
Suppose we chose the road.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.800
But immediately comes another question.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.140
The road can actually be built

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.520
differently.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.860
You can push, say, a regiment of soldiers

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.220
with the loops.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.160
You can use less manual

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.820
work and more machines.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.540
After that, what is it about?

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.880
Choosing the right production

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.320
technology.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.900
We built the road.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.640
In short, the cake is baked.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.720
What should we do next?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.700
Then we share this cake.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.940
So the question arises which?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.380
For whom to produce?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.780
In the application to the road, this

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.800
may mean this.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.640
You can make the road paid or free.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.550
If we make the road free, we answer

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.050
the question for whom to produce,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.430
for whom the road.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.770
If there is a free road, it is a

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.510
road for all who want to.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.630
If it is paid, it is already

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.550
a road for those who can

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.570
pay the required amount.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.290
Maybe a compromise option.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.290
The road can be free for residents

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.210
of our region and paid for residents

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.130
of other regions.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.700
Three main issues of economic

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700
choice.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.900
And then, see, I said before that

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.180
economic theory consists of

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.680
two parts.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.640
Microeconomics and macroeconomics.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.540
What are they studying?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.360
Look at the slide.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.260
Microeconomics studies the behavior

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.380
of individual economic agents and their

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.400
interaction in individual markets.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.340
Individual economic agents can

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.740
be, for example, a separate

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.960
firm or a separate household.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.380
And the focus of microeconomics

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.300
is on the prices and production volumes

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.940
of individual goods, the choice

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.980
of individual consumers, the

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.560
output of resources of individual

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.850
firms, and so on.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.070
Macroeconomics, in turn, studies

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.110
the economy as a whole as a

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.790
single system.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.110
And in the center of its attention

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.010
such generalizing indicators

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.070
of social production, such

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.790
as the domestic product,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.290
economic growth, unemployment,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.370
inflation, and so on.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.290
Well, let's find out a few simple

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.710
examples.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.030
Let's say that X has fired 100

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.850
people.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.160
What is the Economist Theory?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.600
of the microeconomy.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.400
Why is?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.570
This is because it is a matter of individual

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.290
company behavior.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.730
In Russia, the unemployment rate has declined.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:10.610
In this case, what is it about?

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.930
Economy in general.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.550
This is about macroeconomics.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:23.500
So think about it.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.940
Micro or Macro?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.280
Actually a micro.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.620
It is actually a microeconomy.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.420
Why is?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.280
Because in this case we are talking

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.000
about a market for a single product,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.980
even a very large market.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.960
Microeconomics studies individual markets,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.340
markets of individual goods.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.200
But a separate market is not necessarily

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.940
the marketplace of our village.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.020
A separate market can be the global

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.960
market, for example, the global

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.100
oil market.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.840
It is a subject of microeconomics.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.680
And a few more comments on the same subject.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.300
We should not think that

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.320
microeconomics is dealing with things

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.040
that are less important, less significant.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.000
In fact, everything big

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.340
comes from the small.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.160
It is impossible to understand how a forest

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.720
develops without knowing the laws

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.000
under which individual trees grow.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.920
And in general, look, the micro

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.000
console literally means small, but

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.040
it is not really a matter of size.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.900
The object of microeconomics may be larger

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.540
than the object of macroeconomics.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.520
The simplest example, for example,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.320
Microsoft, a separate company.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.320
Its activity relates to the course of

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.860
microeconomics, but at the same time,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.920
in terms of annual output,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.420
Microsoft exceeds the domestic

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.260
product of, for example, Luxembourg.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.680
But the Luxembourg economy is a

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.900
macroeconomy, an object of macroeconomy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.120
What is going?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.080
The object of microeconomics, I repeat,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.740
may be larger than the object

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.100
of macroeconomics.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.820
And another comment.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.260
There is no need to separate

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.820
any wall and micro and macroeconomics.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.850
In fact, they flow smoothly

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.190
into each other.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.550
Please look at

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.690
the slide.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.770
The next slide.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.270
We will talk to you about something

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.350
very important.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.190
Both economic costs.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.390
I have said that the main

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.870
problem of economic theory is the

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.610
problem of rational choice.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.630
And as soon as we make a choice,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.530
the concept of economic costs arises.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.650
This is probably the most important

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.940
concept in economics.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.000
I will stay on it in more detail.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.320
First the definition.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.960
At first glance, it may seem

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.740
difficult to you.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.620
There is actually nothing complicated.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.100
I will explain.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.140
Please look at the definition.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.440
We read.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.360
The economic costs of obtaining

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.220
a good are other goods that

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.440
could be obtained with the same

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.060
resources, but which will

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:09.520
have to be abandoned if the choice

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.980
is made in favor of

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.620
that good.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.620
I think you should be the first

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.040
to take your example.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.460
You came to study some science,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.440
say, the same economy.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.900
So tell me, please answer yourself

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.100
the question, what are your

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.420
costs of studying this

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.560
course?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.560
We are actually talking

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.720
about costs.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.560
Let me explain what your cost

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.140
of studying economics is.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.100
Well, it is likely that many

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.720
of you first remembered

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.220
the fee for training.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.940
It doesn't really matter how much

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.060
you pay, but how much you pay.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.530
Of course, tuition is your

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.750
cost, but economists make

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.390
some adjustments.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.390
Now the annual course of study

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.770
at the Moscow University,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.270
at the Faculty of Economics,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.290
is probably about 7 thousand

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.510
units.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:38.250
At the end of the 19th century,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.270
the annual rate was about 30 rubles.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.470
It means that then it was

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.770
cheap, and now it is expensive.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.690
I hope you understand that nothing like that.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.010
So, is that what economists say?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.650
And economists say that when

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.090
you pay money for getting some

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.870
good, such as education, you

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.400
spend, you lose not that money,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.760
but what other goods you

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.540
could buy with that money.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.360
Here are those unreceived benefits and

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.980
are your losses or your costs associated

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:38.940
with receiving the

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.500
good in question.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.020
Well, for example, you could study

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.740
economics, and you could spend economics.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.840
If you study economics, you will

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.420
not be able to rest normally.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.580
This is your loss related to the

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.820
study of economics.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.700
Someone could buy a new coat

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.940
instead of studying economics.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.360


00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.540
So, the costs associated with

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.400
studying this course, the absence

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.480
of a shirt, loss or cost.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.060
well well well.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.180
What else do you lose by studying economics?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.100
In addition to paying for your studies,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.120
you are still wasting time.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.820
But again, it's not the time

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.500
itself, but what benefits

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.580
you could acquire during

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.720
that time.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.900
What benefits are you losing?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.600
Each in different.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.080
Someone would work more,

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.360
earn more money,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.760
instead of studying.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.380
What will be included in

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.980
the cost of education?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.420
The lost salary, or rather the

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.520
benefits that could have been bought

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.320
for that salary.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680
Someone could repair an apartment

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.010
instead of studying.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.230
What will be included in the alternative

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.570
costs?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.850
It is a disappointment to

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.090
live in an unrepaired dirty apartment.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.670
Instead of learning, you

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.690
can raise a child.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.010
What is the alternative

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.550
cost of getting education?

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.190
An uneducated child.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.980
Someone could just rest.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.420
Therefore, alternative costs will be included

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.160
in education.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.360
What?

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.600
Lost pleasure of watching

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.080
your favorite series.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.740
What does it get?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.940
What to estimate alternative costs,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.180
obtaining this benefit, yes,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.600
forgot to say, alternative costs

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.840
and economic costs are

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.980
synonyms.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.520
To estimate the alternative costs

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.700
of receiving this benefit, you need to estimate

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.300
all the losses that you are incurred

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.900
in connection with this.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.300
Now, in order to bring these losses

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.220
to a single denominator, the value

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.600
of these losses would of course

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.040
be desirable to be expressed in

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.140
monetary units.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.180
Well, I would like to make a

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.960
few more comments about alternative

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.360
costs, very important, which

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.940
must be taken into account.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.540
The first observation.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.680
Alternative costs arise only

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.180
where there is an alternative.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.120
There is no alternative,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.740
no alternative or economic cost.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.340
Let us give an example.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.620
I've said before, we're considering

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.200
a situation when you decide to

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.940
study a new course.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.530
During this course you should

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.950
spend money on food.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.730
Will the cost of food be included

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.850
in the alternative costs of learning

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.530
data, receiving education?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.110
No, they will not enter.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.330
And here is why.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.110
Because you have to eat

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.170
anyway, whether you

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.890
study or not.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.890
Alternative costs arise

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.910
only where there is an

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.930
alternative.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.170
If you have to bear costs regardless

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.030
of whether you are doing it

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.460
or not, then these costs are

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.260
not included in alternative

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.180
costs.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:14.730
Let us give such an example.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.750
Here is the road.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.570
It leads from point A to point B.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.710
How are two tracks.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.790
On this side the cars go from A to

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.260
B, on this side the cars obviously

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.660
go from B to A.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.100
You have to get by car from A to

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.380
B.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.320
Where will you catch the car?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.740
On which side will you stand?

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.320
Well, obviously, the elementary

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.000
life experience suggests that you

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.560
will be standing somewhere here.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.000
Explain your behavior from the perspective

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.960
of alternative cost theory.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.980
I will say immediately that the turnover from

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.760
A to B is temporary, if the car is going

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.780
this way, and you decide to become all-

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.890
yet here, the turnover will be considered

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.810
to be zero.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.610
Why are you all standing here?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.450
Let us discuss.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.110
What do you want?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.730
Obviously, you want to get from A to B

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.890
as cheaply as possible.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.010
And obviously, you think the driver

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.690
will take the smaller amount of money

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.450
from you the less it costs.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.450
Sooo with this question.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.610
What are the alternative costs

00:22:54.610 --> 00:23:00.510
of the driver to transport you, you,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.710
from A to B, if he still goes

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.260
there?

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.840
They are zero or close to zero.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.320
Why is?

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.320
Because if he still drives in this direction,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.240
then neither his time nor his gasoline

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.980
consumption will be included in the

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.100
alternative costs of transporting

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.650
you, he still drives in this

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.670
direction.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.570
There will be alternative

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.010
costs.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.750
But they are related to what?

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.050
Not wanting to have a stranger

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.870
in the room.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.210
Little you throw out.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.430
But if you are a nice lady, then,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.230
I dare assure you, there are no

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.530
costs, only benefits.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.510
Therefore, of course, the lady is most

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.210
likely to stop the car faster than the men.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.650
And look what would happen if you caught

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.170
the car standing here.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.650
The cars go from B to A, and you need from

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.550
A to B.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.690
You will deploy the car, but then

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.570
the alternative costs of the driver

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.090
will be much higher.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.370
Then the alternative costs of the

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.990
driver to transport you from A to

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.630
B, if he is driving from B to A, these

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.670
costs will include everything, and

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.630
lost time, and fuel costs, and everything.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.930


00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.630
Imagine that here at point A is

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.830
an international airport, and the

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.990
driver is going to fly out

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.110
to rest abroad.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:04.010
You are his airport and you will

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.310
be lucky in B, but you will have

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.010
to pay him a lot because his

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.610
alternative costs in this

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.030
case will be very high.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.230
We live in a world of alternatives,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.290
there are many alternatives.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.190
All alternatives cannot

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.550
be implemented at the same time.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.110
Therefore, when you assess the

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.550
alternative costs of obtaining some

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:43.430
benefit, you must choose the best

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.650
of the possible alternatives.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.370
The example.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:54.190
Let's say that some women have

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.110
a choice for today.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.150
Today she has several

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.990
alternatives.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:10.320
Well well well.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.760
What are the alternatives for the evening?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.860
to rest.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.540
and rest.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.320
Just rest at home, watch TV.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.100
Meeting with Thomas.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.300
Meeting with Jeremy.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.420
Studying the economy.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.980
There are four alternatives.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.460
The question.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.240
What will be included in the alternative

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.360
cost of rest?

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.560
It is impossible to implement all together.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.940
You cannot meet with Thomas and Jeremiah

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.120
at the same time, and also

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.700
study economics at the same time.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.240
To estimate alternative cost

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.080
of rest, what should be considered?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.520
The value of the best of the other alternatives.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.790
Well, obviously what is it?

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.870
Studies of Economics.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.730
So, in the alternative cost of

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.820
rest will include, in this case,

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.040
the lost pleasure of studying

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.400
economics.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.890
Well, in the first approximation, I

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.590
hope that the economic or

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.470
alternative costs we have solved with you.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.250
But there is another very practical

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.450
concept, very important for practice,

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.270
the concept of non-refundable costs.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.070
Please look at the slide.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.570
After the determination of

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.650
economic costs, the determination

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.790
of non-refundable costs is given.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.410
What is written there?

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.030
Irreversible costs are costs

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.390
that have been incurred before

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.970
and cannot be reimbursed.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.840
Economists do not take this

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.400
cost into account.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.400
Let us look at the example.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.860
You are at a crossroads.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:35.820
Here is the starting point.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:43.940
You have the choice to study or not to study.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.740
To make the right choice, you need to estimate

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.140
the benefits and losses, that is,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.800
the costs you incur in connection

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.560
with the study.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.300
What benefits do you get from studying?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.120
Well, you probably expect to finish

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.680
your studies for a higher

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.380
salary or a more successful

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.640
career.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.300
Someone who likes

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.440
to learn, I've met too.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.820
And let's say that the benefits of

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.720
getting education you could estimate

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.280
in rubles conditionally.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.240
Suppose you think that if you go to

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.380
study, then you will get different

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:44.560
benefits of 120 rubles.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.060
well well.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.020
But on the other hand, if you

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.280
go to study, you will suffer some

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.880
losses.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.820
What losses?

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.660
We have already talked about them.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.740
You will lose what?

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.140
The salary?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.940
Maybe maybe.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.820
You will have to pay for your studies.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.830
You can rest less.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.530
All of this is your losses, all of this is

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.090
your costs related to your studies.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.690
If you didn't start studying, what would

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.450
you get?

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.430
You would save on the fee for study.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:37.020
You would have more rest, and so

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.320
on and so on.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.880
Let's say that you estimate it at

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.100
100 rubles.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.960
If you go to school, how much

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.760
do you get?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.280
Profits of 120 rubles, but suffered

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.000
losses of 100 rubles.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.320
Obviously what?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.000
The benefits outweigh the costs.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.000
So it is worth starting the study.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.400
If you think rationally, of course.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.600
OK is.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.140
They started studying, paid money,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.300
just started studying, and

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.640
faced a very unpleasant surprise.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.080
Teaching worse than you expected.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.840
Which of the two numbers does this mean?

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.840
Bad study.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.320
But obviously the benefits.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.940
If you are being taught badly, what do you mean?

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:53.520
Get the benefits of education for a

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.980
smaller amount.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.500
Suppose it turned out that with

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.920
this quality of learning you If

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.260
you reason rationally, you would

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.280
not go to study.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.260
In fact, what is the point?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.060
How much benefit do you get?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.000
At 80 rubles, and lose at 100.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.160
It is not necessary to learn, obviously, but there

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.740
is a nuance.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.680
Let's say that of these 100 rubles

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.920
of cost, 50 rubles, let's say,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.320
it's a tuition fee, and 50

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.520
rubles, in 50 rubles you estimate

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.140
all the other losses.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.460
And let's say, again, that under the terms

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.420
of the contract you have money at the time

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.940
of the start of the study.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.060
What does this mean?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.660
What is when you were here at this

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.980
point, those 50 rubles you have

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.680
already paid have turned into irreversible

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.940
costs for you, which will

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.920
not be reimbursed

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.920
to you under any circumstances.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.180
Even if you continue to study, even

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.420
if you quit.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.840
What are your options now, when you

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.440
have already started studying

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.280
at this point?

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.960
Continue to study or what?

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.420
Or quit studying.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.200
Continue or quit.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.980
What do you think of when you are already

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.120
at this point?

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.980
Yes, I was fooled by promising the best knowledge.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.260
But now, if I continue studying, how

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.700
much benefit will I get?

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.040
for 80 rubles.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.180
What are my costs in connection

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.740
with continuing studies, alternative costs?

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.800
Only 50 already.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.080
That 50 rubles will not be

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.040
returned.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.620
You continue to study even if

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.340
you stop it.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.220
So what will those 50 rubles

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.940
be in?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.180
In irreversible costs.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.700
These are no longer alternative costs.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.020
At this stage, you should not take

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.240
them into account.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.640
Economists do not take into account

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.020
non-refundable costs.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.760
They look forward.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:46.450
Here is another example to make

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:50.450
it easier to understand this.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.570
You are abroad.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.870
You bought a ticket for a yacht tour.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.130
During the tour you are photographed.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.870
And it wasn't time to end, the tour

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.090
hasn't yet finished, as the

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.330
photos are already shown,

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.410
printed, hanging on a rope.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.230
You are not asked to take photos,

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.510
you are not forced to buy photos.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.670
You can decide whether to buy or not to buy.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.180
The photos are expensive,

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.900
$3 per piece.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.360
Well, let's ask yourself what are

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.790
the alternative costs of a photographer

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:44.770
at the moment when all the photos

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.390
are already shown, I repeat,

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.590
printed and hanging on a rope.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.110
What are they equal?

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.130
If you think they include the cost

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.750
of the film, the cost of the photographer'

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.930
s work, then you're wrong.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.350
Note that at the time when the photos

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:09.610
are already taken, the alternative

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.190
cost of the photographer

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.470
is zero.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.130
Why is?

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.030
Because at this point he

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:26.010
had already borne all his

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:31.890
expenses, and his expenses

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.780
became irreversible.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.840
If so, what kind of behavior

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.340
would you best choose?

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.740
Of course to negotiate.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.080
How to do it best?

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.380
You have to go to the photographer, just

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.720
take the eye in the eye and say.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.740
Here is a great job, beautiful

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.240
photos.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.760
I like these three very much.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.810
What to do?

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.470
During this tour I spent all

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.150
my money.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.210
I only have one dollar.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:31.770
You can even open your wallet

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.670
and show him that dollar.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.250
I understand that it's not good, but

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.050
I didn't know, dear, what could I do?

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.590
I didn't know there would

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.730
be such great photos.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.890
I spent all my money.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.530
I only have one dollar.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.850
I like these three photos.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.090
You can put that dollar in front

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.590
of him, take pictures.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.660
He will be unhappy, but he will

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.840
not pursue you.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.420
Why is?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.640
I repeat again.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.490
What is the alternative for that moment?

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.730
What can he do with your photo?

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.130
You may be a highly respected member

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.890
of society, but you are not Julia

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.030
Roberts or Michael Jackson.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.230
So what is his alternative?

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.070
Or sell this picture?

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.130
Or just break it and throw it away?

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.750
So is his alternative cost

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.750
of using photos, in addition

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.670
to selling you, zero?

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.870
He talks about himself in Turkish,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.630
but he will say something like that.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.130
Spartish sheep, though wool and cloth.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.090
Know it in advance to make such a

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.090
fruit that you all behave like this.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.750
He't have you photographed

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.870
at all, but when the photos

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.650
are already taken, his

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.450
alternative costs are zero.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.190
All of its costs have

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.270
become irreversible costs.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.870
You see, people in business often

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.350
catch each other on irreversible

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.430
costs.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:17.730
Most often it is not ethical, but

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.510
in this case my conscience, I

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.970
think, is absolutely pure.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.330
I did not ask him to take a photo of myself.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.910
If I had a contract with him,

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.390
I would have promised him to pay

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.990
$3 for a photo, and then, when he

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.390
had all the costs, I would have

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.610
said that I don't have money,

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.970
here it would be probably not

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.750
ethical.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.530
But in this case I did not ask him

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.310
and I do not think I did anything wrong.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.900
Well, we looked at you, decommissioned

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.320
economic costs and non-refundable

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.540
costs.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.520
Let us summarize this first

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.460
question.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.340
What would be good

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.080
if you had a dry

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.140
rest?

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.460
What is Economics Studying?

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.080
Decisions made in society

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.700
about using limited

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.840
resources to

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.480
meet unlimited needs.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:40.600
The main problem of the economy is the

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.200
problem of choice in the context

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.320
of limited resources.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.980
When it is necessary to choose,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.620
the concept of alternative or

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.320
economic costs arises.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.220
The economic costs of receiving

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.740
a given good are those goods you

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.700
had to give up, or more precisely

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.020
the value of those goods

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.920
you had to give up if you made

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.760
a choice in favor of that

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.380
good.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.560
If all costs are already incurred,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.040
they become irreversible costs.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.520
Well, and don't forget, of course,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.640
that economic theory consists of

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.720
two disciplines – microeconomics and macroeconomics.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.900
Well, let's go back to the

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.620
slide “Theme Questions.”

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.260
You see, two questions.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.040
The first is economics as a science.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.960
The second is the economic cycle.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.960
Well, the first time I thought

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.000
“Hudo – poor” we watched you.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.820
The second question is very interesting,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.960
but I will leave it to you

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.920
for independent study.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.360
In the text of the lecture he has

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.080
with Russian examples.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.560
We are just a little limited

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.720
in time, we have a lot to do ahead.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:28.150
Let us move to the second topic.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.350
The second topic, please

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.490
see the slide, is called “The

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.010
Demand-Offer Model and Its

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.010
Use in Economic Analysis.”

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.860
This is a very important topic,

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.840
because the supply-demand model

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.880
is the most important, most

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.260
widely used model in the

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.520
microeconomics.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.580
It explains how prices and volumes

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.980
of goods sold and purchased

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.580
in individual markets are formed.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.320
Again, it can be a local market,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.900
a national market, and even

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.740
a world market, but a

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.140
separate good.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.820
How is the price formed?

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.500
The price, obviously, forms

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.520
depending on the supply and demand.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.760
The first question is the demand

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.120
and its factors.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.600
In the second question, we will stop with

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.000
you on the proposal.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.060
The third is market balance.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.380
We will connect supply and demand

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.400
together and see how

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.820
market price is formed.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.060
Then we can talk a little about the practical

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.240
applications of the theory.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.400
So look at.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.120
Start the first question.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.500
Demand and its factors.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.100
The definition is very simple.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.180
Please look at the slide.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.400
It is in line with the usual

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.700
logic of life.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.420
Logic to read.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.600
Demand is the amount of goods

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.120
that all buyers can and want

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.260
to purchase during a given

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:22.080
time and under certain conditions.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.680
Nothing difficult, I think there

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.240
is no.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.540
Demand is how much good we want to buy.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.880
The moment in time must be asked, the

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.720
time must be asked, and certain conditions

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.200
must be taken into account.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.180
These factors are called

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.140
demand factors.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.240
What are the main factors of demand?

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.220
Please look at the slide.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.140
The first factor is the price of this product.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.920
What is obvious.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.640
Obviously, the demand for a product

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.080
depends on its price.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.760
I think, I think everyone agrees.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.400
The second factor is the price and the

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.560
number of products.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:08.880
How to understand?

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.620
Well, let's look at the demand, let'

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.160
s say, on the giraffes.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.160
What does it depend on?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.780
It depends on the price of the jigsaw.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:28.660
But it also depends on the prices of

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.360
the foreign marks of a similar class,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.740
which are substitutes for the jigguls.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.940
I hope you understand, no?

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.600
If foreign brands are cheaper, we will

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.300
most likely make a choice in favor

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.220
of foreign brands, while reducing

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.060
our demand for jigol.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.460
The third factor is the price and the quantity

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.060
of supplementary products.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.880
What products are complementary

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.020
to the giraffes?

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.960
Gasoline, service, garages, spare

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.420
parts, many things.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.700
And when I decide whether

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.800
to buy or not to buy a jigolo,

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.340
I will think about what.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.720
The price of the jiggles is undisputed, but

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.800
also about what I will cost the service

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.040
of the jiggles, that is, the price

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.900
of supplementary goods.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.440
Demand for jiggles depends, again,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.700
on the price and quantity of complementary

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.000
goods.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.220
The third factor is income and

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.700
their distribution among different

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.640
groups of consumers.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.260
But what is obvious?

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.140
If our income grows, then we will probably

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.800
not necessarily, but most likely

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.800
increase demand for jigol under

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.340
other equal conditions.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:58.250
The third factor is the consumer habits and tastes.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.030
It also has an impact on demand.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.470
The number of consumers obviously

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.370
affects demand.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.390
The more consumers live in our

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.290
city, the more demand for one

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.850
or another good in that city.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.470
The preclimate conditions.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.990
In my opinion, everyone understands that

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.310
in Africa the demand for shirt

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.310
will be small, and in the North a little more.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:22.470
Expectations of consumers.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.410
I will talk about expectations separately.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.870
So, let's talk about the factors

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.390
of demand a little more in detail.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.550
But stop, that moment I forgot.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.590


00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.010
Please look at all the

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.210
factors of demand.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.510
How many there are there?

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.310
One, two, three, four, five,

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.070
six, seven, eight.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.010
8 factors of demand.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:50.890
And how you think, this is how you

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.670
think, what an important factor,

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.070
very important, obviously life-influencing

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.610
on demand, I will not mention.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:02.850
Which factor do I not mention?

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.350
I have not said anything about the quality

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.650
of the product.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.930
But don't rush, don't include quality

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.110
among the factors of demand.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.550
That's why economists don't do that.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.450
Because we are talking about the demand for

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.850
this product.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.810
The demand for this product

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.390
implies the demand for the goods

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.650
of this quality.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.150
The quality of the product

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.090
is initially considered.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.240
If the quality changes, we consider

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.240
it as a different product,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.640
though a very close substitute.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.560
In other words, the 10th and 12th models

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.460
in microeconomics are

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.340
considered as different goods.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.940
Moreover, even the jiggles of different

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.000
colors are also considered in the

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.920
microeconomy as different goods.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.620
Of course not?

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.860
The quality of the product is

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.840
initially determined.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.200
Therefore, it is not mentioned among the

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.580
factors of demand.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.680
Now let's talk more specifically about the

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.820
factors of demand.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.480
The first factor, I repeat, which?

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.420
price of this product.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.120
Let's see how the price of

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.860
this product affects demand for it.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.480
It is very easy.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.200
There is a so-called law of demand

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.420
in the microeconomy.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.640
Let's see the next slide.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.860
Here is its formulation.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.260
The law of demand.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.820
The lower the price of the product,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.360
the more it is purchased during

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.860
the given time and under

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.700
other unchanged conditions.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.580
The law of demand is graphically reflected.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.680
Please look at the schedule, the

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.220
picture.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.960
See, on the axis X we postpone the

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.360
quantity of goods.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.200
I use an internationally accepted designation.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.740
Quantity in English means

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.880
Q.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.120
And by the axis Y we indicate,

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.040
we postpone the price of this product price.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.540
And what do we see?

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.420
Look carefully at the picture.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.380
I think it's easy, there's nothing here.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:43.300
The lower the price of the product, the

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.920
more what?

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.740
The size of demand for it under

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.260
other, I repeat, unchanged conditions.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.780
Only a small reservation.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.900
I have drawn the linear function.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.620
In fact, it can not necessarily

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.900
be linear.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.800
It can also be non-linear.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.740
It could be something like that, wrapped.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.880
But this does not abolish the laws

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.020
of demand.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.880
The linear function of demand is most

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.120
often used for simplification.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.700
We looked at how it affects

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.480
demand.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.880
The first factor is the price.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.860
But there are seven other factors in addition

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.140
to the price.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.580
Let us talk about them.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.740
Look at the next slide.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.860
Written by.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.040
The impact of all other factors

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.140
on demand is manifested in the shift of

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.800
the demand curve, upwards to the right when

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.760
demand increases and downwards to the left

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.580
when it decreases.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.640
Look at the schedule.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.520
Let's say that the demand function is

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.520
initially set to D0.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.800
Imagine that consumer income

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.720
has increased.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.700
Nothing has changed anymore.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.800
What does this mean?

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:22.240
That at any possible price people

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.140
will want to buy this product more

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.540
than before.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.500
Where does the demand go?

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.920
to the right.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:33.900
The reverse situation.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:40.680
Consumer income has fallen.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.320
What will we most likely face here?

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.730
That at any possible price people

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.530
will want to buy this product

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.950
less than before.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:58.290
And the demand curve will move left down.

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.150
What was the factor?

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.050
The fourth, yes, the fourth factor.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:06.270
Income of consumers.

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.330
What is the fifth factor?

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:12.570
Consumer habits and tastes.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.670
I think it is obvious too.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.750
Imagine such a situation.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.610
Russian consumers suddenly

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:27.170
also loved Estonian products.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.650
For example, the cream.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.370
What will this lead to?

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:35.730
That the demand for cream, for Estonian cream

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:39.670
will decrease, and the demand curve

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:43.530
will shift to the left.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.410
See, here is what is important to

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.450
keep in mind.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.010
What I am saying to you now

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:50.210
seems to me conceptually very simple.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.070
But it is very important to learn to

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:57.210
translate words into the language of graphics.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.430
So, I said, if the Russians suddenly

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.890
discovered the harmful properties of

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.770
Estonian cream, then the demand for

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:10.630
cream will fall, and the curve will shift

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.750
to the left.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.310
Well, I very hopefully, over

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.150
time, the Russians will all

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.310
get it out and understand that Estonian

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.390
cream is not so bad.

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.670
Moreover, it is very eaten.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:23.590
What will it lead to?

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.830
That the demand for cream will increase

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.470
again at the same price of it.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.690
So the demand curve will move to the right.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:38.670
So, we haven't talked about expectations yet.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.730
What are the expectations in the microeconomy?

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:45.930
First, the expectations

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.670
of price changes.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:52.470
Imagine that consumers expect that

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:57.050
in the near future the desired

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:59.730
product will travel.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:02.490
What are they doing today?

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.990
Most likely, today they will

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:08.610
buy more goods, there may

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.030
be a high demand for goods.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.170
And demand will increase, accordingly, the

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.890
demand curve will shift to the right.

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.510
If consumers have other expectations,

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:22.490
they expect that soon this product

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:24.470
will be cheaper, then why

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.150
buy it today?

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.050
Today, demand for it will decrease under

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.510
other equal conditions, and the demand

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.890
curve will shift to the left.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.390
By the way, it is often used

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.970
by some companies in their

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.470
advertising strategies.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.990
How do you usually try to lure

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:49.670
buyers Don Stroy?

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:56.250
They usually say that today the prices are

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:59.810
the same, and from the first day

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:03.710
of the next month the apartments are rising.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.750
So what do the company

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.850
executives want?

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.450
They are looking to increase demand

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.670
for apartments today.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.760
Moving the demand curve to the right.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.640
well well.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.800
Let us now look at the second factor, about

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.100
which we have not talked yet.

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.080
What was the second factor, if you

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.120
remember?

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.160
The second factor was the price

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.420
and the number of products.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.740
Let's see how demand, changes

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.960
in the price of imported

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.140
cars affect demand for jigsaw.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.460
For some reason, imported

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:53.320
cars are expensive.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.460
Please look at the slide on the

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:56.660
left chart.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.720
On the left chart, the demand for imported

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.200
cars function.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.880
The initial price, say, of

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.840
cars was P1, and wanted

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:12.120
to buy Q1 cars imported.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.420
The car was priced at P2.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.340
So, they want to

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.800
buy less imported cars.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.100
The demand dropped to Q2.

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.740
But as imported cars are getting

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:33.860
more expensive, it means that

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:37.460
consumers at any cost of cars

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.040
want to buy more than before.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.860
And the curve of demand for gypsy

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.280
has shifted, shifting to the right,

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.640
right up.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.700
Something similar, by the way, we

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.100
observed immediately after

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.880
the financial crisis of 1998.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.210
Remember what happened then.

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:03.530
The ruble has fallen sharply.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:06.910
As a result, the ruble prices of foreign

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.290
marks increased.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.330
For many consumers, foreign marks have

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.610
become inaccessible.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.710
They switched, accordingly, to

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.990
what?

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:17.470
In the Jigsaw.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.790
The bus temporarily solved its

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:21.930
sales problems.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:23.710
Demand for jigsaw has increased.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:27.050
The demand for giraffes has shifted to the right.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.820
Now let's talk about how

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.240
complementary markets interact

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.980
with each other.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.120
In relation to cars, the complementary

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.640
product is gasoline.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.180
Suppose the cars were traveling.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.120
What will this lead to?

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.540
Well, before cars were worth,

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.200
say, the price of some car

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:59.020
was P1, bought Q1 cars.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.400
The cars now stand P2,

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.520
buy them Q2.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.520
But by buying fewer cars, we, with

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.220
the rest equal, start to

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.180
spend, to present less demand

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.780
for gasoline.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.840
The demand for gasoline is shifting

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.760
to the left.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.980
The demand for gasoline is decreasing.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:27.960
I think I have considered all the factors.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.860
To conclude this question, here

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.480
is a very important comment.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.660
Look at the next slide.

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.280
Economists distinguish between demand

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.100
and demand.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.700
These concepts sound very similar, but they

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.260
are different concepts.

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.580
If the change in purchases of a given

00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.760
product occurs under the influence of a

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.260
change in its own price, then they say

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:10.040
about a change in the amount of demand.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.680
In this case, the demand curve does not

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.820
shift, but we are going as if on the

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.780
demand curve.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.540
Return to the previous slide.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.700
cars and gasoline.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.620
What happened to the cars?

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.380
The cars traveled.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.520
They are now buying less.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.600
Previously, the price of P1 was purchased

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.720
Q1 cars, now the price of P2

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.620
is purchased Q2 cars.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.160
Why are less cars purchased?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.160
Because they traveled.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.100
In this case, we say that the

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.760
demand for the car has changed.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:59.140
And we are going on the demand curve from below up.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.680
If the change in the purchase of goods

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.040
occurs under the influence of all other

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.260
factors, then they speak of the

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.660
change in demand itself.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.130
And here is already a shift in the

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.430
demand curve.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.570
Return to the previous slide.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.370
Why buy less gasoline?

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.370
They imitate the car.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:32.710
At the same price of gasoline,

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:35.070
they start to buy less.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.570
Here, the demand for gasoline curve goes

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.390
to the left, and we say that the demand

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.670
has decreased, namely the demand for gasoline.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.850
Not the size of demand, but the demand.

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.490
All, the first question we have finished with you.

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.910
Now let's talk about the second question.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.530
The proposal and its factors.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.260
The definition of supply is as simple

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.240
as the definition of demand.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.660
We read.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.080
The offer is the amount of goods

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.380
that all producers can and want

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.900
to produce and sell during

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.960
a given time and under certain

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.660
conditions.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.840
Well, the same thing.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.980
Demand is how much they want to buy,

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.900
and supply is how much they want

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.860
to produce and sell.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.460
Now the proposal factors.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.500
Let us look at them.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.560
There are a lot of them here too.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.900
The first factor is the price of this product.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:43.340
The second is the profitability of

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.500
goods that are competitive to this

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.160
product in production.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.640
I fear that this is not very clear,

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.260
but we will look at it on a specific example.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.160
The third factor is not better.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.380
The profitability of goods supplementing

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.640
this product in production, we will also

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.400
consider it on the example.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.900
The fourth factor is the cost of producers.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.500
The fifth factor is state taxes

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.540
and subsidies.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.160
The sixth producer.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.460
The Seventh Goal.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.340
The 8th natural condition.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.160
The ninth is the expectation of the producers.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.740
Well let us.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.200
We talked about the factors of

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.420
supply, now we talk about the

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.300
factors of demand.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.160
The first factor of the offer is the price

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.300
of the product.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.760
This is what economists call

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.920
the law of proposition.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.560
Here it is, on the next slide.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.560
The Law of Proposal.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.800
The higher the price of the product,

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.980
the more the producers

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.240
want to sell during this

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.000
time and under other unchanged

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.500
conditions.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.540
This law is contrary

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.780
to the law of demand.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.420
How did the law of demand sound?

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.500
The lower the price, the more they want to buy.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.160
What is the proposal law?

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.360
The higher the price, the more they want to sell.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.680
We have graphically introduced this law.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.660
Again, we are putting X on what?

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.260
quantity of goods.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.920
But now it is no longer the size

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.660
of demand, but the size of supply.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.900
And again, the price of the goods.

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.020
And what do we see?

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.500
The rising function.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.240
The higher the price of the goods,

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.060
the more they want to produce and

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.600
sell.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.640
Why is it so?

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:06.880
Let us look at this on a simple

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.780
conditional example.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.540
Let us take a very conditional

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.800
example with you.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:20.100
There are only three oil

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.760
fields in the world.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.560
In each field, only one

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.280
barrel of oil can be extracted

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.840
under natural conditions.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.460
No more can.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.460
For the sake of simplicity, we introduce this.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.300
This is the simplification.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.240
But, obviously, every producer

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.160
would like to sell their oil

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.860
as expensive as possible.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.220
At least for a million dollars.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.020
Every manufacturer

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.540
has a minimum price.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.100


01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.440
If oil is cheaper than that price,

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.140
it will simply not be involved.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.860
And the differences in these minimum

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.340
prices are due to differences in

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:20.960
the costs of oil production at different fields.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.960
We have three oil fields.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.460
The first field is conditionally in

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.400
the Middle East.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.140
Suppose the minimum

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:35.100
price for the Arabs

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.100
is, suppose, $5 per barrel.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.360


01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.080
Minimum acceptable price for Arabs.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.420
Next, the second oil field,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.380
let's say, is located in Siberia.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.060


01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.380
There is a higher cost of mining.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.200
And let's say that the

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.280
minimum price for a Russian

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.940
firm is $10 per barrel.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.600
Once again, if the price is below

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.880
$10 a barrel, I believe that

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.060
oil production becomes

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.760
unprofitable and the Russians

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.440
stop oil production.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.440
And finally, the third field,

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.680
let us find it in Norway,

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.220
on the shelf of the North Sea.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.960
The minimum price for the

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.240
Norwegians is, say, $15

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.180
per barrel.

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:34.970
Once again, I want to emphasize

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:37.330
that only one barrel

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:39.350
of oil can be extracted

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:40.930
at each field.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.990
Let us now reason.

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:50.210
Suppose the price, the market price of

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:52.990
oil, the price of oil, so has fallen,

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:54.970
fell less than $5 per barrel.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.510
Under $5 per barrel fell.

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:00.370
How much oil will be produced?

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:03.210
Obviously, under such conditions, no

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:05.690
one will be involved in oil and the supply

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:09.170
of oil to the market will be zero.

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:13.950
And if the price reaches $5 per

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:16.390
barrel, I repeat again, $5 per

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.430
barrel is the minimum price

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.170
that is suitable for

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.870
the Arabs.

01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:25.290
It no longer pleases anyone but

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:25.910
them.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.150
So at $5 the price of oil

01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:31.570
will be delivered to the

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.390
world market?

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.330
Only one barrel.

01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:37.070
well well.

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:41.170
What if oil is on the way up and

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.030
the price is $10 per barrel?

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.930
Arabs more than the barrel

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.090
we assume to extract simply can not.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.070
Who to connect?

01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:52.010
The Siberian?

01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:54.050
The Russian company began to extract oil.

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:56.270
$10 per barrel is the

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.230
price that is the minimum.

01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:01.130
So how much of the barrel and oil will

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.550
be offered to the world market?

01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:05.790
Two more Arabs and two more Russians.

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:07.750
How much oil will be available

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:08.530
in the world market?

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.810
Two barrels

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.570
well well.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:17.370
And if the price reaches $15 per

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.270
barrel, who will connect?

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:20.430
The Norwegians.

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:23.350
They are already harvesting.

01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:24.830
Three barrels in total.

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:26.430
They are producing their barrel.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:28.290
And the supply of oil in the

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.630
world market is reaching what?

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:32.130
Three barrels

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.810
What will we and you get?

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.190
We can transfer this table, the data

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:40.790
of this table to the chart.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.710
Here is look.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.900
By axis X, the quantity of goods, oil

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.000
in our example.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.680
by price of goods.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:05.670
So at $5 per barrel, how

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.310
much do you get?

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.910
1 barrel is placed on the market.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:15.670
At the price of 10 mines and offer

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.930
for sale 2 barrels.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.580
At the price of 15 they offer for sale 3 barrels.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.540
Having combined all these points, what

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.480
have we gotten?

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.620
Dependency of the amount of

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:39.200
oil offered on the world market

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.320
from the price of oil.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.360
What did you and I get?

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.910
The supply of oil.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.030
We indicate the proposal with the

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:56.550
letter C.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:58.800
Why is?

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.220
and Sappled.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.900
Well, there is a case when, say,

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:09.540
you ask a bad student for an

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:13.600
exam, you draw him a function, you

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.580
write the letter C and you ask

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.540
him, is this a demand or this a proposal?

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.960
He thinks that the letter C means demand

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.080
and says it is a function of demand.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.140
And he gets two, not for ignorance of English.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.080
In English, it means

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.180
supply.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.200
And for ignoring that the demand

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.840
function simply cannot behave like this.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.260
The ascending function is the function of the offer.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.620
It is in accordance with the law of proposal.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.660
The higher the price, the greater

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.380
the supply will be.

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.620
So why is it still up

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.840
this function?

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.500
Because with the rise of the

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.840
price, it becomes profitable

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.760
to produce goods where the cost

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.020
of the goods is higher.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.840
Besides the price, there are many other factors.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.260
Let us talk about them.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.420
Let us see.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.760
The next slide.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.420
We read.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.660
The effect of all other factors

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.480
on supply is manifested in

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.220
the shift of the supply curve

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.140
to the right down when the

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.300
supply increases and to the left

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.780
up when it decreases.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.680
Let us try to figure it out.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.140
What does the offer increase?

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.800
This means that at the same price

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.860
they want to offer more goods to

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:03.770
sell than before.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.000
Well, let's say, before at the price

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.220
of $10 per barrel, how much was

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.100
offered to sell?

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.020
Two barrels of oil.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.700
And now for some reason are

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.380
they selling at the same price

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.260
how much?

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.660
Not two, but, suppose three.

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540
What does it get?

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.440
The proposition curve shifts to the

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:39.300
right, that is, when the proposition rises,

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.160
the proposition curve shifts

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.780
to the right down.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.740
When the offer falls, what does

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.200
it mean that the offer falls?

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.440
This means that at the same price,

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.580
the goods are offered for sale

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.100
less than before.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.360
For example, at the price

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.280
of $10 a barrel, two barrels of

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.900
oil were offered for sale.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.800
For some reason, only

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.740
one barrel.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.780
And what will happen?

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.440
Where does the curve offer go?

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.850
Left and up.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.100
So again again.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.800
When the supply increases,

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.780
the supply curve moves again.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.240
Right and down.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.200
When the offer is reduced,

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.660
the offer curve moves left and

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.620
up.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.180
Let's see now, why can

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.020
this happen?

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:53.490
There among the factors of the proposition, the

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:56.930
fourth, in my opinion, the factor sounds like this.

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:59.690
Costs of producers.

01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:03.690
Let us discuss.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.770
Suppose for some reason, I don'

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.470
t know why, the cost of all

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:14.630
three fields increased by

01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:16.650
$5 per barrel.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:20.650
In our example, $5.

01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:24.470
The next factor, the fifth, is

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:26.610
the fifth factor, state taxes

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:28.210
and subsidies.

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:32.550
How does it affect the proposals?

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.830
In fact, taxes are different.

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:38.230
We will take those taxes that

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:40.830
increase the costs of producers.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:44.150
The taxes are the same cost.

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:48.230
When we impose a tax, the costs

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.910
of producers increase by size.

01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.490
Taxes and supply curve go up.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.910
The offer is reduced.

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:58.050
What is a Subsidy?

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:01.210
Taxation and the opposite.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.750
When the state does not take money, it gives

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:03.970
it to the producers.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.350
With the donation and cost, the

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:07.630
costs are reduced.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.510
And the wrong proposal goes where?

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:11.590
down to the amount of the grant.

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:15.910
The natural conditions are not difficult.

01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:20.570
Let's talk about the expectations of the manufacturers.

01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:25.470
The expectations of producers.

01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:28.830
Remember when we talked about

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:30.650
demand, also looking at expectations.

01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:32.110
What were the expectations?

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:35.670
Expectations, changes, prices of goods.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.280
well well.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.120
Suppose, manufacturers all expect

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.540
their goods to travel soon.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.660
How will they act today?

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.060
They will probably hold the goods.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.380
Do not rush to sell.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.460
And accordingly what?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.720
The offer will decrease and the offer

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.780
curve will go to the left.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.300
To the left, up.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.780
The simplest example.

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.200
You are going to sell your apartment.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.200
You expect that soon the apartments will still travel.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.420
You will not be in a hurry

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.180
to sell your apartment.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.940
If all do so, the supply of

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.700
apartments on the market will be less.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.060
On the contrary, if everyone expects that

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.160
the apartments will soon be cheaper, what

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.320
will the manufacturers try to do?

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.180
The seller will try to sell their

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.280
apartments as soon as possible.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.840
As a result, the supply of apartments

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.080
will increase.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.540
Here is such an example.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.940
Near the house where I live, from

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.060
the unforgettable times, a whole garage

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.860
town emerged.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.860
There was a rumor that a new elite house

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.960
would be built in this place.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.940
What are we watching?

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.560
On each column of the advertisement I sell a garage.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.800
People expect that soon the garages will

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.640
be demolished, accordingly, they will be cheaper.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.820
They are selling their garage.

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.460
The supply of garages is increasing.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.340
Now let's look at the second and

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.760
third factors.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.300
Here you can see the profitability

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.040
of goods that are competitive data

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.200
of production trade.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.200
Let's talk about this factor.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.960
Imagine two products in the market,

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.360
in the food market.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.740
Carrots and, for example, potatoes.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.340
The carrot has traveled.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.640
How do you think this will affect

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.580
the potato supply?

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.120
Just look, to give the correct

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.420
answer, you need to stand in the

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.560
position of a farmer-producer.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.120
Not in the consumer's position,

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.220
so we will not understand anything.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.520
The position of the farmer.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.440
What are farmers focusing on?

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.160
profitability of a good.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.100
The carrot travelled.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.160
So the profitability of carrots

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.900
for farmers increased on other

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.040
equal terms.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.580
What does the farmer answer?

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:42.300
They increase the supply of carrots.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.980
And in fact, before, look at the slide,

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.260
the carrots were P1 worth, the carrots

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.480
were offered on the Q1 market,

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.700
now the carrots are P2, and the carrots

01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.320
are offered on the Q2 market.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.960
So, with the rise of prices, farmers

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.120
increase the supply of carrots.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.660
But the earth is limited.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.600
I started this lecture.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.660
The needs are limitless, and

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.520
the resources, including land, are limited.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.720
But the earth is limited, what does that mean?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.460
If farmers offer more carrots to the

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:26.060
market, they take the land out

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:28.700
of the potato and occupy that land

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.940
with carrots.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.740
What do we mean watching?

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:38.000
We see that the potato

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.460
market is getting

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.540
smaller.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.180
I repeat, carrots produce

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.260
more.

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.720
The soil is taken from the potato, given

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.220
under the carrots.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.280
So the soil under the potatoes

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.000
is getting smaller.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.700
And at the same price of potatoes,

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.380
the supply of potatoes decreases.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.020
Look at Chart B, Chart B on the right.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.320
The potato supply is shifting.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.400
From S0 to S1 goes to

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.520
the left.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.980
To understand this better,

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.360
let's look at another example.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.400
Think for yourself.

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:30.810
Think for yourself.

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:35.770
Let us model this situation.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.810
Economists are traveling.

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.810
What will happen to the proposal of the

01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:47.390
tankers conditionally?

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:50.770
Well, an economist is the same commodity

01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:52.510
as carrots, potatoes or jiggles.

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.170
So if we draw the curve proposal

01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:59.070
of economists, what will we postpone

01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.930
on the X axis?

01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:01.870
Their number.

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:06.330
And on the axis Y, the price of the economist,

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.570
his salary.

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:11.310
We are seeing a rising curve.

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:13.790
How much did economists cost?

01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:14.890
by P0?

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:19.930
How many people have chosen the

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:23.070
profession of economist?

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:24.510
K0 is

01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:28.010
And the market was offered, the labour

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:30.670
market, to the economists at this

01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:32.950
price, that is, at this salary.

01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:35.830
Economists are traveling.

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:43.260
The price of the economist P1.

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.960
What are young people responding to?

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.720
A large number of young people, under

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.800
other equal conditions, are starting

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.720
to choose the profession of economist.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.580
And after some time, the market's offer

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.760
of economists increases from

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.680
Q0 to Q1.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.120
This is the wrong proposal of economists.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.040
They are economists.

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:13.910
Now let's look at the tank market.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.780
My logic here is very simple.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.280
I come from what?

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.680
That if a young man chose the profession

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.020
of an economist, he will not go conditionally

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.680
to the tankman.

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.660
Does that mean we are watching?

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.160
At the same price of the economist

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.740
P0, the supply of economists

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:45.420
on the market will be smaller than

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.420
before.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.800
So where will the curved offer go?

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.780
The left?

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:02.270
Now let me...

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:05.730
This is what I suggest you to think about.

01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:07.510
to think.

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.250
The oil traveled.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.300
What will happen to the supply

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.300
of natural gas?

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.890
Think of.

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:27.290
Oil has traveled.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.700
What will it lead to?

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:36.340
That at higher prices of oil

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.240
it will be produced in those

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.320
fields that were previously unprofitable.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.380
Oil supply will increase.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.940
So they are no longer economists, they

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:48.700
are oil.

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.400
You see, the price of oil was

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.620
P0, conditionally $10 per barrel.

01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:57.320
It produced 2 barrels of oil.

01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:00.100
And at the price of P1 $ 15 per

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.200
barrel began to produce 3 barrels.

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:08.950
But very often, when oil is extracted,

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:11.570
natural gas is also

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:12.290
extracted.

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:16.730
So what will it lead to?

01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:25.670
Will the supply of gas on the market increase?

01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:32.810
That is, look, gas is a good that

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.490
complements oil in production.

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:37.490
What are we watching here?

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:42.510
Where will the gas supply

01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:43.510
curve move?

01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:48.050
to the right.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.810
At the same price, they will

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:53.170
produce more gas simply because they

01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:55.110
are producing more oil.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.300
To end this question, let

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.280
us stop at this very

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.920
important moment.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.240
Remember, I told you that you should

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.560
distinguish between the concept of demand and

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.580
the amount of demand.

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.640
Similarly, the concept of the offer

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.380
and the amount of the offer must be distinguished.

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:26.450
We read.

01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:29.210
If you look at the slide, if the change

01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:34.110
in sales of a given product occurs under

01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:36.490
the influence of the change in

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:41.390
its price, then they say about the change

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:44.510
in the amount of the offer.

01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:47.890
This is the movement along the

01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:49.230
proposal curve.

01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:51.230
Please look at.

01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:54.430
Why is oil producing more?

01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:57.630
Because oil has gone.

01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:03.650
Therefore, we go on the proposal

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.110
curve from this point to this.

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.570
The curve proposal does not move here.

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:13.090
Oil increased, and the supply

01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:15.850
of oil increased.

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:17.790
Read on further.

01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:21.670
If the change in the sales of goods

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.890
occurs under the influence of all

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.830
other factors, then they say about

01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:30.630
the change of their own offer.

01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:33.350
And then there is a shift in the curve

01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:34.490
of the proposal.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.290
Look at the right schedule.

01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:41.290
Oil is expensive, more is being extracted.

01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:42.470
Here we are going on the curve.

01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:45.790
At the same price, the gas

01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:50.230
is offered to the market.

01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:54.790
And we are seeing a shift in the

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.330
curve of gas supply.

01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:58.290
In our example, right down.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.330
The second question we have discussed with you.

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:05.770
We move to the third question.

01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:07.270
The Third Question.

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.690
The market balance.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.800
What is required here?

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.340
So far, you and I have looked at the

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.740
demand and the offer in isolation from

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:21.400
each other.

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:26.220
And now we have to combine

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.880
the function of supply and

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.360
demand in one picture.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.240
This is how it is done in the slide.

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.160
Two curves of demand and offer.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.200
Let us discuss.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:47.860
Suppose the price was at P1 level

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:52.860
at the beginning.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.420
P1 is

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:57.360
Look what we will observe.

01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.300
You see, the price is high.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:07.580
At this price, the demand is small.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.340
What is it equal to the schedule?

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.920
Q1D

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.800
See you?

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.880
At the price of P1, the demand

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.900
value is Q1D.

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.460
At such a high price, few would

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.200
like to buy this product.

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:29.360
What do you think of the offer?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.220
The price is high.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.680
At this price, many would be happy

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.960
to produce and sell this product.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.540
The value of the offer at the

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:46.880
price of P1 is Q1S.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.000
So what do we observe?

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.620
At P1 the supply

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:57.840
exceeds the demand.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:02.040
We are also seeing a market in the market.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.340
Manufacturers want to sell more

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.240
goods than consumers agree to

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.080
buy at this price.

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.960
In this model, we are considering

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.380
the so-called fully

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.460
competitive market.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.100
What is a completely competitive

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.540
market?

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.680
This is a market with a lot of

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.020
independent sellers and buyers.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.800
No one controls the price.

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.220
The price on the market is set naturally

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:42.260
under the influence of the demand of thousands

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.000
of buyers and the supply of hundreds

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.540
of sellers.

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:50.220
But still at the P1 price, when

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.960
the sellers can't sell all

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:56.840
their goods, the price begins to fall.

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:04.740
Let's see now what happens if the market

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.320
price accidentally completely, suddenly

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:10.520
settles at the level of P2.

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.220
What do we see now with the P2 price?

01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:18.110
The price is low.

01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:21.810
At this price, many would be happy

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.190
to buy this product.

01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:26.990
And the amount of demand for

01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:31.530
the product is, look at the slide, Q2D.

01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:34.430
The price is low for manufacturers.

01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:37.290
At this price very few producers

01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:41.090
would like to produce and

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:42.550
sell this product.

01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:45.070
That is, at the P2 price, the Q2S product will

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:48.550
be offered to the market.

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.870
What are we watching now?

01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:54.910
They want to sell, they want to,

01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:57.510
sorry, buy more goods than they want

01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:59.130
to sell.

01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:00.990
What is the name of the difference?

01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:02.430
Do you know that word?

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.760
Of course the Devi.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.700
There is a deficit in the market.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:13.720
And the price of the goods naturally begins to rise.

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:18.820
The next step, what are we watching?

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:22.280
Look carefully at the slide.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.720
There is a price P

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.020
with a star, where the values

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:32.560
of supply and demand

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.300
coincide.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:39.220
This price is called the equilibrium

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:43.140
price.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.120
P is the equilibrium price.

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:49.220
The quantity of goods purchased

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.320
and sold at this price is

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.920
called the balance quantity.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:01.120
Let's see how the balance

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.340
can change.

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:10.230
The next slide we call a balance

01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:12.950
shift.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.680
shift of balance.

01:33:18.650 --> 01:33:20.930
Let us reason.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:24.090
Suppose for some reason, people'

01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:26.530
s income may have increased.

01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:30.250
Demand for goods increased.

01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:35.200
What are we observing as a result?

01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:44.050
The demand curve moves upwards to the

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:48.670
right from position D0 to position D1.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.940
At the same time, the cost of

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.420
the manufacturer is increasing.

01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:56.900
What does it lead to?

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.420
That the supply of goods decreases

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.480
and the curve of supply moves where?

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.800
Left up.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.140
What are we watching?

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.420
The demand curve moved to the right.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.940
The curve proposal moved to the left.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.520
And now they are crossing those

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.300
curves at another point.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.580
What is happening in this regard?

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:29.930
The price of the goods must increase.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.240
Both factors in this case, both the increase

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.640
in demand and the decrease in supply,

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.100
pull the price toward the increase.

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:44.360
The price of P1 was P0.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.220
What happens to the equal number?

01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:51.960
I have Q1 on the Q0 chart.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.420
The balance amount remains

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:54.440
the same.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.140
But it is not necessary.

01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.220
Imagine that the demand function

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.860
has shifted more to the right

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.380
than the supply function

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.240
to the left.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.420
But see what will happen?

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.320
In this case, the price will be

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.760
even higher and the balance amount will increase.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.220
Imagine the reverse situation.

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.140
When the price, when the curve

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.980
of supply shifted to the left stronger

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.320
than the curve of demand to the right,

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.020
what will we now observe?

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.980
The price will again rise even more,

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.800
but the balance amount will now decrease.

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.260
The third question we have looked at.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.880
The fourth question is quite large.

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.640
There are many practical applications of this theory.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.060
Let us briefly discuss

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:56.120
some of the simplest applications.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.200
In Russia, due to favorable

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.260
weather conditions, this year

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.400
a record grain harvest was

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.560
collected.

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.150
Please illustrate this situation

01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:14.550
graphically.

01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.800
I am convinced that the market

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.420
for grain in our country

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.320
is very competitive.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.060
So, will it be what we have?

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.700
The number of grains on the axis X, the price

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:35.800
on the axis Y.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.500
There are some functions, basic initial

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.820
functions, demand and offer,

01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:47.420
I will designate them D0 and S0.

01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:53.610
There is a certain equilibrium price P0

01:36:53.610 --> 01:36:58.870
and a certain equilibrium quantity Q0.

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.240
Now the conditions.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.880
I will repeat it again.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.140
Due to favorable weather conditions,

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:11.240
this year record grain harvests

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.000
were collected in Russia.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.140
What will change in the schedule, think.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.420
Well, in fact, if a record grain harvest

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.220
is collected, it means the market is

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.200
overwhelmed with grain.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.340
The supply of grain is increasing.

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.220
And when the grain supply

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:39.440
increases, where does the supply

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.080
curve go?

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.240
Right down and down.

01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.260
Right down and down.

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.560
What are we watching?

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:59.040
The price of grain is beginning to fall,

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.540
and it will be sold more on the market.

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.820
Note that in this case, for

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:09.240
now only the supply curve

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.480
is shifted, but not the demand

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.400
curve.

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.780
Because no factors affecting

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.600
demand have changed here.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.420
Just the market is overwhelmed with grain,

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:25.020
grain more, grain price falls, and grain

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.160
is buying more, but we go here.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.980
The supply curve moves, the demand

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.860
curve does not move, we go along

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.600
the demand curve.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.120
Due to the price decline, consumers

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.600
are buying more grain.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.940
Continue to analyze the situation.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.380
Suppose that under such

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:48.820
conditions the Ministry of Agriculture

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:53.380
decides on additional

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:56.800
purchases of grain to the

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.600
state reserve.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.900
What will be on schedule?

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.180
Think, it is not difficult.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.800
Additional purchases of grain

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.960
in the state reserve.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.420
If so, who will go to the

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.300
market?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.520
A new major buyer in the person of the Minneapolis.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.320
So what is increasing now?

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.460
The grain demand and demand curve

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:43.580
shift to the right to position D1.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.360
What does the producer

01:39:48.230 --> 01:39:50.850
of Minecraft do?

01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:55.930
It tries to keep the price

01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:59.350
below P0 to support

01:39:59.350 --> 01:40:01.110
farmers.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.560
Another thing is that when the Ministry of

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.460
Agriculture actually carried out such a

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.160
policy, farmers already sold their grain

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.900
and he really supported the buyers with

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.140
their grain purchases.

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.420
Another example.

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:28.760
The economies of India and China are seeing

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.940
rapid growth.

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:35.460
How will this affect the global

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.960
oil market?

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:38.760
Well again.

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.240
Look at the global oil market.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.160
Is there anything here?

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.500
The quantity price.

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.940
There is an initial demand for oil in the

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:52.680
world market.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.380
There is an initial oil offer.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.660
There is a balanced price.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.880
There is a balanced number.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.840
What happens next?

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.860
The Chinese and Indian economies are growing rapidly.

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.240
How will this affect the global

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.100
oil market?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.860
Well obviously.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.120
Fast-growing economies need

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.620
more oil as a necessary

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.920
raw material.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.720
So what is happening in the global market?

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:40.950
The oil demand curve is shifting to the right.

01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:42.570
And we watch what?

01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:48.010
Reduction of oil.

01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:50.710
But the balance also grows.

01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:52.730
If the oil supply curve

01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:54.690
has such an upward tilt.

01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:58.610
Another example.

01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:04.370
The price of oil has risen sharply in

01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:05.510
the world market.

01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:10.970
How will this affect the foreign exchange market

01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:12.090
in Russia?

01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:18.350
I would like to point out that

01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:20.590
the change in the world oil price is

01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:22.090
a subsidiary condition.

01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:25.350
We are studying the changes

01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:30.170
in the currency market in our country.

01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:35.470
What is sold and bought in the currency market?

01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:39.330
The foreign currency.

01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:42.430
For example, the US dollar.

01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:46.050
So on the axis X we will postpone

01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:47.390
the amount of dollars.

01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:52.890
The dollar is a commodity like any other.

01:42:54.090 --> 01:42:56.410
There is demand for dollars, there is its offer.

01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:59.350
So, on the axis X, the amount of dollars.

01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:09.880
The price of the dollar in rubles

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:10.900
is called.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.480
The dollar course.

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:19.100
So there is something we have.

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.980
Initial dollar demand and

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:27.140
initial dollar supply.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.760
Let us reason.

01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:31.600
Oil has gone?

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:35.340
Russia exports oil.

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:41.010
So, the influx of foreign

01:43:41.010 --> 01:43:43.310
currency, US dollars, to the Russian

01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:47.270
market has increased.

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:48.390
What will we see?

01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:54.330
The dollar offer is increasing.

01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:57.790
And the curve of the dollar offer is shifting

01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:01.950
to the right.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.240
What happens to the dollar?

01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:13.190
The dollar is getting cheaper.

01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:15.230
This is actually happening in Russia.

01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:19.670
Due to the large influx of dollars on the

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:24.570
Russian market, the dollar is cheaper.

01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:27.470
And now let's assume that the Bank

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.250
of Russia, the Central Bank, does

01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:35.100
not want the dollar to cheaper.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:35.900
What to do him?

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.980
He wants the dollar to remain

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:42.880
the same, P0.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.480
What to do with the central bank?

01:44:53.050 --> 01:44:57.190
It should increase the demand for dollars.

01:44:58.090 --> 01:45:01.330
He starts buying dollars.

01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:02.630
What are we watching?

01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:06.390
On the one hand, the supply of dollars is growing,

01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:10.070
on the other hand, the demand for dollars

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.450
is growing.

01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:16.640
This could lead to the dollar

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.340
price remaining.

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:21.120
The dollar rate remains the same.

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.860
Or maybe it will fall a little if the

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.100
Central Bank's demand increases by

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.420
a smaller amount.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.120
Suppose it will be.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.100
What we are actually watching now.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.440
And to finish this question and at the

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:45.480
same time this topic, we need to understand

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.680
that this model, it describes

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.420
the various market situations well.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.860
But it is actually nothing more

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:59.020
than a tool like a hammer.

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:02.420
This tool must be used.

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:06.340
In order to correctly predict the

01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.900
consequences of the changes in

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.600
demand and supply in the real market,

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.220
it is necessary to understand that

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:16.240
the functions of demand and

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.260
supply are not always so standard,

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:21.160
so classic.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:28.560
See what a realistic look of the proposal

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.400
function is.

01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:40.990
Demand for proposal.

01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:46.670
Sooner or later, the function

01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:50.750
of the proposition moves to the vertical.

01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:52.590
See here.

01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:56.290
Remember, I assumed that we only

01:46:56.290 --> 01:46:59.490
have three oil fields in the world

01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:01.310
market.

01:47:01.810 --> 01:47:04.450
And, suppose, the price

01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:07.690
set at $15 per barrel.

01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:08.590
Remember our example?

01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:13.770
Three barrels of oil are

01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:16.310
bought and sold.

01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.650
But the fourth field simply does

01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:24.900
not exist.

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:31.980
So, the fourth barrel of oil

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.480
just got nonewhere until new

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.620
fields were opened.

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:40.600
So what is the

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.080
curve proposal?

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:42.840
This is such.

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.240
It goes vertical.

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:58.700
If so, what will increase

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:04.840
demand for oil?

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.760
Only the price of oil.

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.920
The balance of oil on the global

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:13.980
market will remain the same.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.320
Just the same.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.400
And the demand curve may not

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.540
be quite standard.

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.220
Well, the standard type of demand curve, here

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:23.860
it is.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:32.580
And if it doesn't give you God and I

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.520
insulin too, what depends on the

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.380
demand for insulin?

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.760
The number of patients, right?

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.420
Well, the prices depend slightly,

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.360
at least within a certain

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:51.400
price range.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.780
And if this is the case, then the curve

01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.120
of demand for insulin at a certain price

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.040
of insulin will not buy less, this must

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.360
be taken into account.

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:21.800
This is insulin, a commodity that is

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.020
not easy to replace.

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:26.420
There is a product that is easy

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:32.040
to replace, and it is easy to refuse.

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:35.560
Beer of this brand.

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:40.160
What is the role of beer demand?

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:42.380
Not for beer at all, but

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.560
for beer of this brand.

01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:46.420
Goods are easily replaced.

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.080
So, with a slight increase in the

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.380
price of beer for this, for this

01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:53.760
type of beer, it is for

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.120
it, consumers can easily switch

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.020
to another type of beer.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.880
So what is the demand function?

01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.340
Very sexually.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.080
This is what I repeat again

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.880
to better predict the

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.880
effects of the change in supply

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.420
and demand in the same market.

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.620
We need to see what the

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.660
real functions of supply

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:32.120
and demand will look like.

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.140
They are not always standard.

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.300
They can be both vertical

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.920
and horizontal.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.980
I repeat again.

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.680
More detailed theory.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.020
These are described in the text of the lectures.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.840
You can get acquainted with them.

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.980
The second topic will end with you.

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.040
We move on to a new topic.

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.420
Production and costs.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.640
Please see the topic

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:14.540
slide.

01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:16.240
My first question is with you.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.480
The production function.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.440
What is it?

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.380
First, the definition of production

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.400
is very simple.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.520
Production is any human

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.540
activity to transform

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.900
limited resources of any

01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:33.400
kind, material, labor,

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.620
natural, finished products.

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.300
So what is the idea?

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:41.700
To produce something, we need resources.

01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.760
And the production function shows

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.440
the relationship between what?

01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:49.060
Between the amount of

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.400
resources used and

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.600
the maximum output

01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.020
output volume that can

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.460
be achieved provided

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:02.560
that all available resources

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.160
are used fully

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.860
and most efficiently.

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.080


01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.220
The housewife is baking cakes.

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.560
Within an hour, say, she can

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:20.940
bake, if she works normally,

01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:22.940
not unworking, but better

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.940
organized her work, she can

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:28.780
afford to bake 10 cakes.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.140
So if we indicate the quantity of

01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.680
the household labor by L labor, labor,

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:39.200
and production by Q quantity,

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.540
then the elementary production

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:44.560
function is like that.

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.760
Q is multiplied by L.

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:51.260
I hope you can see that this

01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:56.780
feature shows how the output varies

01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:58.800
depending on the amount of work

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.320
used by the housewife, provided,

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.500
I repeat, that her work has

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.060
been organized optimally

01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.120
and works with normal intensity.

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:10.380
This is the simplest

01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:11.600
production function.

01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.060
More complex functions are used

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.220
in economics.

01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:18.940
Here, please, the most commonly

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:21.320
used in economic theory is

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.620
the two-factor production function,

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.960
which reflects the dependence

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.020
of output on the amount

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:35.200
of labour and capital used.

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.880
Labor is L, capital

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.760
is K.

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.100
Q is equal to A multiplied

01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.500
by K in alpha, multiplied

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:47.360
by L in beta.

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.600
So K and L is the amount

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.800
of labor and capital used.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.100
I just want to clarify.

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.900
We measure labor in human hours, and by

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.440
capital we understand not the sum

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.900
of money, we invest it in business,

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:08.640
but what is called in the economic

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.060
theory physical capital, that

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:12.040
is, the means of production,

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.320
machines, machines and equipment.

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.580
Thus, the amount of capital we measure

01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:22.000
usually in machine-hours.

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.360
And again, alpha and beta are

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.460
already known parameters.

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.980
And if we know them, it is

01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:34.680
enough for us to submit the quantities

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.700
of labour and capital that

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:39.080
can change, and we can get the

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.900
corresponding quantity of release.

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:45.740
I repeat again, that is achievable

01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:49.560
on the condition that both labor

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:56.800
and capital are used in the most rational way.

01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:01.520
What do these parameters mean?

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.400
Start with the parameter A.

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:06.920
Please imagine that the

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.920
quantities of capital and labor

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.120
are given, and the parameter A

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.260
changes.

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:18.120
What does this mean?

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.080
In the same case, with the same quantities

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.500
of capital and labor, we can

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:27.800
get a larger volume of production.

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.440
So, parameter A reflects the

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.380
impact of technical progress on

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.860
the production function.

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:39.240
What do parameters A and B say?

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.000
A and B are the so-called coefficients

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.340
of elasticity of output on labor

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:50.100
and capital.

01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.440
What does this mean?

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.720
Coefficient A shows how

01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.140
much the output changes

01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:03.320
by 1% when the capital changes

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.900
by 1%.

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.020
Accordingly, coefficient B shows

01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.840
how many percent of the output

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.180
can be changed when the

01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:20.900
change of only one percent of labor.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.180
Knowing the production function, we

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:27.500
can measure the yield from scale.

01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.580
Read the definition on the next

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:33.900
slide of scale yield.

01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.980
The yield of scale shows how many times

01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:43.480
the output increases with the simultaneous

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:46.120
increase of all factors of

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.300
production, that is, all

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.500
resources n times.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.280
To produce something, we need resources.

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.400
Let's say we use two factors:

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:01.720
labor and capital.

01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:07.140
Suppose we and you have doubled

01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:10.200
the amount of labor and capital,

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.180
that is, built a two-fold

01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:14.840
factory.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.420
This means that we use twice

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.020
as much capital, twice

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.580
as much machines, and

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:23.380
twice as much labor.

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:28.260
What about production?

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:29.960
Production will grow, but not the

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.360
fact that it will double.

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.840
Possibly three cases.

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:37.980
The first case.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.980
We double the number of factors

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:44.280
and the output triples.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:47.060


01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.860
In this case, we say that there

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:55.020
is an increasing return from the post office.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.880
The second case.

01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.680
We increase output, we increase all

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:04.440
factors, sorry, n times, that is,

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.320
labor, if capital has increased

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:07.340
n times twice, in my example,

01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:09.680
and output increases

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.320
less than n times, for example,

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.400
one and a half times.

01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:17.440
Then we say that there is a decreasing

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:20.480
return on scale.

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:21.800
And the third case.

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.180
We increased both factors, all

01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:28.640
factors increased n times twice

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:30.880
in my example, and the output

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.900
increased also n times, too

01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:33.540
twice.

01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:37.760
Then we say that there is a

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:40.980
constant return on scale.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.380
The nature of the return on scale,

01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:46.320
it plays a very important role in

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:49.660
determining the optimal size of the enterprise.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:50.920
Let me say, the giraffes.

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:55.180
They can be collected in a small workshop.

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.520
Maybe of course.

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.700
The car, as a production complex,

01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:04.700
in terms of labor and capital, we

01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:07.580
may suppose, is a hundred times greater

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.460
than such a small workshop.

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.300
That is, it uses a hundred times more

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.860
of the factors of production.

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:20.180
And the output of the car car

01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:23.120
is increased by 200 or 300 times.

01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.380
What does that mean?

01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:29.740
As a car, assembling cars in a large

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:33.400
factory is more effective than in

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:34.320
a small workshop.

01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:36.720
So if the return on scale increases,

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:38.620
what do we have?

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:48.320
Increase the size of the enterprise.

01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:49.200
Another example.

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.580
In Soviet times, they were

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:52.980
very interested in building

01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:55.040
giant enterprises, including

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.580
in agriculture.

01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.040
They built, for example, giant pig

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.780
farms for thousands or even tens

02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:05.960
of thousands of cattle.

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.380
Not only that the whole ecology flew within

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.720
a radius of 100 kilometers.

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:11.600
Here is what was.

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.660
For example, a giant pig farm

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:18.960
uses a hundred times more factor

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:21.520
production than a small farm.

02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.180
And the meat production

02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:27.400
in her is, let's say, only ten

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:28.360
times more.

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:31.180
What does that mean?

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:33.640
That large enterprises in agriculture

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.040
are economically inefficient.

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.840
This is why small farms

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:40.580
are quite effective in agriculture.

02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:42.860


02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.980
And when we increase the size of the

02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:50.140
enterprise, we sooner or later come

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.680
to a situation in which the increasing

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.140
return on scale is replaced

02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:57.680
by a constant, and then decreasing.

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.980
This means that it is not worth strengthening

02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:03.800
the company.

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.900
It is better to enjoy a large

02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:09.000
number of, but a smaller

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.620
size.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.800
Knowing the production function, we

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.080
can always calculate the cost of the company.

02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.840
Here we move to the second question.

02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:34.680
Economists divide costs into

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.180
accounting and economic.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.900
Definition of accounting costs.

02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:40.560
Please look at the slide.

02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:45.060
Accounting costs of a company are

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:50.650
the amount of actual payments purchased

02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.730
by resources.

02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:54.010
Well, that is very easy.

02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:59.460
To produce something, a company

02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:03.260
needs a variety of resources.

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:06.880
This company purchases.

02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:10.360
A accountant then summarizes all these

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:11.560
payments purchased by resources

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:15.660
and enters them into its accounting

02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:18.020
report.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:24.600
Let us look at the simplest

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.320
example.

02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.820
Let us look at the simplest

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:32.420
example of accounting costs.

02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.720
Suppose the company uses equipment

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:42.040
worth 200 rubles and a service

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.020
life, say, 5 years.

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.980
The entire cost of the equipment

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:50.040
cannot be attributed to the

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.140
cost of one year.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.320
We need to use amortization.

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.120
When using the simplest linear

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.980
depreciation, the cost of one

02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.360
year will be attributed, respectively,

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.840
200, divided by 5, 40

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.640
rubles.

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:17.140
The accountant makes its report.

02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:21.040
The amortisation is 40 rubles.

02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:25.620
Further, let's say, a firm uses an

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:31.160
annual accountant writing 80 raw materials

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:36.220
and paying a firm, let's say, 60

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:50.420
rubles of salary per year.

02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:56.640
The accountant says, salary 60.

02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:58.460
Now let's say that

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.040
the equipment is 20 rubles.

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:05.700
The annual loan

02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.480
rate is 20 rubles.

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.640
The loan fee is 20 rubles.

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:16.880
Suppose that no more payments are

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.580
made by the company.

02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.680
Well, it does not incur administrative,

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:24.820
transportation, advertising, research,

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.200
does not pay taxes and is not

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.580
attributable to cost.

02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.180
Nothing of that.

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.660
The accountant summarizes all these

02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:36.320
payments and writes.

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.680
The accounting costs amounted

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.640
to 200 rubles.

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:49.600
The economist has a little of his own view.

02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:58.350
Alternative costs are

02:04:58.350 --> 02:05:01.010
economic costs.

02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:04.310
They represent the value of

02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:07.410
the goods that could be obtained

02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:12.150
by the most profitable of

02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:17.340
all alternative ways of

02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:20.020
using limited resources.

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.540
I am afraid it is not very clear, but it can be easier.

02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:26.020
In practical calculations,

02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:29.740
economic costs include, in addition

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:33.520
to the explicit or accounting

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:37.300
costs, also the implicit

02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:39.280
costs.

02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.740
Can we write that economic

02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:46.640
costs are equal to what?

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.140
Accounting costs plus some other

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:53.020
unclear costs.

02:05:54.460 --> 02:06:00.840
What is accounting costs?

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:01.940
I have already said.

02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:05.920
It is not clear what implicit costs are.

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:06.940
We read.

02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:11.840
The implicit costs are the

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:15.500
amount of incomes of the

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:20.140
company on its own resources.

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:24.000
It is about the income that the

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.640
management of the company could

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:36.680
get by using its resources not in

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:41.260
this business, but somehow differently.

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:43.800
Let us find out.

02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:48.970
Imagine that you have started your own

02:06:48.970 --> 02:06:49.670
business.

02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:51.830
You come into this business not

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:53.230
with empty hands.

02:06:53.690 --> 02:06:59.180
What did you bring with you?

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:02.280
Maybe a lot of

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.380
money.

02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:10.980
Let's say 100 rubles.

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:13.040
Could you use this

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.980
capital as an alternative?

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:20.580
Of course could.

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:22.580
What is the easiest way

02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:23.640
to use that money?

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:28.240
You could put them in the bank.

02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:31.490
You would get a percentage.

02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:33.610
If you invest that money in your

02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:40.850
own company, you have lost that percentage.

02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:46.050
And this unreceived percentage will

02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:52.520
enter the firm's implicit costs.

02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:55.340
Well, let's say you invested 100

02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:57.020
rubles in your business.

02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:00.380
You had to close your

02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:02.980
bank account.

02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:08.260
You have lost 10% of your invested

02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:08.920
money.

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:24.540
I for simplicity assume that the

02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:27.620
bank pays on deposits also 10%.

02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:33.070
So, the implicit cost that these

02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:34.390
funds you got as if free, but

02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:36.790
that does not mean that their

02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:39.190
use should be taken into account.

02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:41.630
So you invested 100 rubles,

02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:45.250
lost 10% on those funds, which

02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:46.970
you could get if you kept that

02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:48.410
money in the bank.

02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:50.510
And accordingly, in the implicit

02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:52.290
costs will include this unreceived

02:08:52.290 --> 02:08:53.890
percentage of 10 rubles.

02:08:55.110 --> 02:08:56.450
and further.

02:08:57.250 --> 02:08:58.710
In order to start your business,

02:08:58.710 --> 02:09:03.630
you had to leave your job.

02:09:04.710 --> 02:09:06.970
You probably worked for hiring before.

02:09:07.590 --> 02:09:08.770
So you lost?

02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:11.910
The wage.

02:09:12.450 --> 02:09:16.610
Unreceived wages will also be included

02:09:16.610 --> 02:09:19.450
in the firm's implicit costs.

02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:23.170
Let's say, by hiring, you

02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:24.710
earned 200 rubles.

02:09:25.170 --> 02:09:28.230
When you start your business, you lose

02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:29.730
those 200 rubles.

02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:31.930
These 200 rubles of unreceived

02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:34.370
salary economists include in the implicit

02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:37.510
costs of your company.

02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:39.910
I write.

02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:45.630
Unpaid salary.

02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:47.510
How many were there?

02:09:47.550 --> 02:09:49.730
20 rubles, I would say.

02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:51.950
Unpaid salary.

02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:54.930
Another assumption.

02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:57.530
Suppose for your business, you have turned

02:09:57.530 --> 02:10:15.520
your apartment into an office or a

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:16.100
warehouse.

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:17.760
What did you lose in this case?

02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:19.720
How do you estimate your losses?

02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:24.190
You could provide this apartment

02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:26.330
for your business, you lost

02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:28.570
those 20 rubles.

02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:35.910
So, the unreceived rent is

02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:38.670
also legally included in the implicit

02:10:38.670 --> 02:10:41.050
costs.

02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:44.470
Unreceived rent is 20 rubles.

02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:46.870
Well well well.

02:10:47.410 --> 02:10:50.210
Summarizing all these lost income,

02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:59.330
we get the implicit costs of the company.

02:11:00.610 --> 02:11:03.990
We got 50 rubles.

02:11:05.310 --> 02:11:08.030
It turns out that the total

02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:10.570
economic costs of the company

02:11:10.570 --> 02:11:13.230
are accounting costs of 200, implicit

02:11:13.230 --> 02:11:20.110
costs of 50, and that 250

02:11:20.110 --> 02:11:22.090
rubles.

02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:23.790
But now we have to answer the most

02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:25.190
important question.

02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.130
Why are economists original?

02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:31.690
For what reason they have invented

02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:33.870
in addition to the explicit

02:11:33.870 --> 02:11:35.750
or accounting costs, which are

02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:38.310
obvious to all, some implicit

02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:40.890
costs, which, I will repeat,

02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:44.330
the firm does not even pay anyone.

02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:50.900
The implicit costs are those income that

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.140
entrepreneurs have lost by investing their

02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.580
resources in the company, which they have provided

02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:03.040
to the company, supposedly free of charge.

02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:04.900
Here is why.

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.800
Without knowing the implicit

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.160
costs, we cannot estimate how

02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:17.120
profitable a business is.

02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.380
I have already said about the costs.

02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:22.320
The total economic costs amounted

02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:26.960
to 250 rubles, but after all,

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:29.700
the firm produces something

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:32.980
and, suppose, produces, sells

02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:36.120
products and, suppose, the

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:41.240
annual revenue of the

02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.180
firm is, suppose, 240 rubles.

02:12:56.890 --> 02:12:59.010
How to assess the accountant situation?

02:12:59.110 --> 02:13:00.910
The accountant only takes account

02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:02.890
of the accounting costs.

02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:05.030
Not because he is so stupid,

02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:07.430
but because the accountant guides

02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:09.170
certain rules of

02:13:09.170 --> 02:13:10.850
accounting.

02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:14.510
The accountant will most likely congratulate

02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:17.370
you on the profit.

02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:22.190
Revenue 240, accounting expenses 200.

02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:38.650
The profit was 40 rubles.

02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:41.070
How do you assess the situation of an economist?

02:13:41.170 --> 02:13:46.750
The economist is losing.

02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:53.930
Revenue minus economic costs.

02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:57.270
It was minus 10.

02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:59.670
Loss of 10 rubles.

02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.230
What does this mean in the mouth of an economist?

02:14:05.050 --> 02:14:06.130
And very simple.

02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:08.710
No one has pulled you into this business.

02:14:09.850 --> 02:14:13.330
If you didn't go, how much money

02:14:13.730 --> 02:14:16.190
would you have in your wallet

02:14:16.190 --> 02:14:18.190
at the end of the year?

02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:22.270
You would keep your money in the bank.

02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:24.770
You would have a annual interest rate of 10 rubles.

02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:27.170
They would hire themselves.

02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:29.650
Annual salary is 20 rubles.

02:14:30.130 --> 02:14:31.610
The apartment could be rented.

02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:33.470
The rent would be paid 20 rubles

02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:34.230
per year.

02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:36.130
You would have 50 rubles

02:14:36.130 --> 02:14:38.570
in your pocket.

02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:41.390
How much do you have in your pocket

02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.930
for the year?

02:14:42.850 --> 02:14:45.630
Only 40 rubles of accounting profit.

02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:48.750
Profit for 240.

02:14:48.850 --> 02:14:50.590
Accountant with 200.

02:14:50.890 --> 02:14:52.250
So you have taxes in your

02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:52.790
pocket.

02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:53.650
I don't take, of course.

02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:55.210
40 rubles

02:14:56.230 --> 02:14:59.370
So you just do not have a profitable

02:14:59.370 --> 02:15:02.470
business under these conditions.

02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:08.670
Now let us summarize.

02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:11.930
Look at the slide.

02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:14.990
The difference between revenue

02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:17.090
and accounting costs is

02:15:17.090 --> 02:15:20.670
the accounting profit of the company.

02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:22.290
We have counted.

02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:24.870
Revenue minus accounting

02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:27.410
costs and accounting profit.

02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:30.170
The difference between revenue

02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:33.850
and economic costs is the

02:15:33.850 --> 02:15:36.170
economic profit or surplus profit

02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:38.790
of the company.

02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:41.730
This is the economic profit,

02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:44.230
the revenue minus the

02:15:44.230 --> 02:15:47.530
economic costs.

02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:49.950
And the third conclusion we can make.

02:15:50.710 --> 02:15:53.390
If the profit is negative,

02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:56.770
the company has a loss.

02:15:57.070 --> 02:15:59.770
Business is not beneficial to entrepreneurs.

02:16:03.730 --> 02:16:05.970
Whatever the amount

02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:07.990
of accounting.

02:16:08.090 --> 02:16:09.690
To conclude this question,

02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:16.200
a few examples.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:18.280
The first example I will give immediately.

02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:20.540
I invented it.

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:34.260
Don't think that we are in the

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:36.040
department really doing this.

02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:39.360
I know that in a week

02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:57.150
on a business trip I

02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:59.730
will earn, suppose,

02:16:59.730 --> 02:17:01.270
100 rubles.

02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:05.990
What are those 100 rubles in my examples?

02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:10.350
100 rubles is my income.

02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:14.450
That's what I get on a trip.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:21.560
But, as I have, I work at

02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:24.000
the Academy of Foreign Trade.

02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:28.120
I have to give you some lessons

02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:29.520
every week.

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:31.800
I just cannot leave like that.

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.540
The class will be broken, there will be a scandal.

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:36.220
What to do?

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.860
I will go to my colleague and say,

02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:43.340
listen, I really need to leave,

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:49.300
take classes, I am uncomfortable to ask him.

02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:52.220
So I will tell him so, take classes

02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:55.460
for me, I will pay you

02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:58.520
50 rubles.

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:01.900
There will be no scandal.

02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:03.520
Administration and it is important that

02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.340
the course is carried out.

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.700
Who will spend?

02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:08.700
This is the second question.

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:11.900
So I pay a colleague to

02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:15.940
travel without problems

02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:18.200
50 rubles.

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:23.200
What are those 50 rubles in our terms?

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:30.490
That's what I take out of my pocket

02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:32.770
and pay to my colleague.

02:18:33.050 --> 02:18:36.730
These are my accounting costs.

02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:39.650
Well, it would seem that everything is okay.

02:18:40.470 --> 02:18:43.590
It is clearly beneficial to go on a trip.

02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:46.750
After all, I will earn 100 rubles on

02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:49.970
a business trip, and I will pay, I

02:18:49.970 --> 02:18:51.510
will bear the cost to go on

02:18:51.510 --> 02:18:53.470
a business trip 50 rubles.

02:18:53.910 --> 02:19:10.840
My accounting income is

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.680
50 rubles.

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.920
But for the sake of simplicity,

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.490
I do not consider any other

02:19:20.490 --> 02:19:21.690
accounting costs related to the

02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:22.630
trip.

02:19:22.730 --> 02:19:24.110
But there is one nuance.

02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:27.870
Because of the fact that I am going

02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:30.790
on a business trip, I will not be able to read

02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:33.190
a lecture on the MBA program.

02:19:34.570 --> 02:19:37.670
No one will make excuses for me here.

02:19:38.290 --> 02:19:42.390
But I will not get a salary.

02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:45.690
Suppose I am paid 60 rubles for

02:19:45.690 --> 02:19:47.410
the MBA program.

02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:51.850
If I go on a business trip, I don't

02:19:51.850 --> 02:20:06.680
make those 60 rubles.

02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:10.620
The total cost

02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:12.020
of the trip

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:22.160
was 110 rubles.

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.580
50 plus 60

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.960
The revenue on the trip is only 100.

02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:37.180
The economic approximation

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:41.140
of the trip is minus

02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.040
10.

02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:44.880
Travelling is unprofitable.

02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.400
Another example.

02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:02.720
Suppose you have a small cafe.

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:07.380
You have decided to set in the

02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.620
corner a small or accounting

02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:12.360
cost on this project.

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.620
Well, obviously, the annual depreciation

02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:20.260
of the machine and the cost of its annual maintenance.

02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:23.920
What will be included in the implicit cost of the machine?

02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:31.500
I assume that there is no

02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:34.260
free space in your cafe.

02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.400
Therefore, if you installed the machine

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:40.680
in this corner, you will have to remove

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.780
the table.

02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:44.220
Well let's suppose.

02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:46.760
Accordingly, lost profit from the table

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.200
will enter the implicit cost

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.420
of the machine.

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:53.860
You cannot ignore the implicit costs,

02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:55.420
otherwise you can't understand

02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:59.770
how profitable or unprofitable

02:21:59.770 --> 02:22:01.350
it is to install the machine.

02:22:01.450 --> 02:22:02.950
Another last example.

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:08.220
My friend was doing this

02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:11.720
business, maybe now.

02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:15.120
It is an intermediary between the mayonnaise

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.860
plant and the shopping points.

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.760
She took mayonnaise at the

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:23.640
factory for sale, and then

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.140
arranged it for retail.

02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:29.340
One day she had

02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:30.600
trouble.

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:33.720
The owner of the container in the

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:37.960
wholesale refused to buy mayonnaise

02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:41.480
from her, explaining that mayonnaise

02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:43.080
is slowly selling.

02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:45.360
She to me.

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:48.220
With this question, Sergey

02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:50.740
Georgievich, and what about it fast

02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.800
or slow?

02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:54.580
After all, I, she says to me, I don't

02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:57.000
take money from him, I give him mayonnaise

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.880
for implementation.

02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:00.940
Sold quickly?

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:02.840
Compare with me quickly.

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:04.520
Selling slowly?

02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:06.260
Compare with me slowly.

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:11.220
What does she not understand?

02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:13.620
It does not understand that the owner of

02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:16.580
the container has also implicit costs.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.200
What are they composed of?

02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:21.580
The container is not rubber.

02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:24.520
If mayonnaise is in this corner,

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:28.260
there will not be, for example,

02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.600
the same Estonian cream, which,

02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:34.040
suppose, sells faster.

02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:37.340
So what does it work out?

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:39.820
Loss of profit from the sale of cream

02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:43.440
will be included in the implicit cost

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.600
of mayonnaise.

02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.860
It turns out that the ordinary trader

02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:51.320
in the market, having no notion of these

02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:53.400
scientific terms of obvious and implicit

02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:56.360
costs, cannot fail to take

02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:57.980
into account implicit costs in

02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:00.620
his practical activity.

02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:05.060
We start with the third question, the types of costs.

02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:10.180
All costs, both accounting and

02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:13.520
complete economic, can be divided

02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:17.880
into constant and variable.

02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:22.100
What is at the basis of this division?

02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:24.140
See here.

02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:28.100
The company is increasing the production.

02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:34.950
And it is evident that with the increase of

02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:39.690
output, some costs change, while

02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:41.010
others remain unchanged.

02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:45.350
The costs that do not change with

02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:48.970
the increase in output are

02:24:48.970 --> 02:24:51.110
called fixed costs.

02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:54.650
The costs that change with the

02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:57.950
increase in output are called

02:24:57.950 --> 02:25:00.110
variable costs.

02:25:00.210 --> 02:25:03.110
Why are costs divided into constant

02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:04.810
and variable?

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:09.630
Because we also divide the factors of

02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:13.170
production into constant and variable.

02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:16.710
The fact is that some factors

02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:20.150
of production can be changed easily

02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:22.590
and quickly with an increase

02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:23.630
in output.

02:25:23.810 --> 02:25:24.950
To increase the issue.

02:25:26.310 --> 02:25:28.590
Well, let's say, it's quite easy to hire

02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:31.110
new employees in the company.

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:34.450
Workers are a variable factor

02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:35.570
of production.

02:25:35.570 --> 02:25:38.550
But the company takes a certain

02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:41.430
amount of time to purchase

02:25:41.430 --> 02:25:43.650
new equipment, that is, to use

02:25:43.650 --> 02:25:45.930
additional capital.

02:25:46.410 --> 02:25:48.290
Therefore, we usually refer equipment

02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:51.350
to a constant factor of production

02:25:51.350 --> 02:25:54.290
in a short period of time.

02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:58.550
Look at the definition again on the

02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:59.730
slide.

02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:03.430
Fixed costs are costs that

02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:06.270
do not change with the

02:26:06.270 --> 02:26:08.350
change in output.

02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:11.910
This is the cost of constant factors

02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:13.290
of production.

02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:16.490
Usually, the fixed costs

02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:19.130
include depreciation, rent,

02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:21.170
interest on the loan,

02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:23.610
and management salary.

02:26:24.130 --> 02:26:25.710
Unclear costs are also

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.390
usually fixed.

02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:31.290
Now the variable costs again.

02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:33.690
Variable costs are costs whose

02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:36.410
value changes with the change

02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:37.410
in output.

02:26:38.050 --> 02:26:40.530
This is the cost of variable factors

02:26:40.530 --> 02:26:41.730
of production.

02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:44.890
These usually include wages in workers'

02:26:44.890 --> 02:26:46.810
production, raw materials and

02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:49.270
materials costs, electricity

02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:51.370
for technological purposes

02:26:51.370 --> 02:26:53.150
and others.

02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:00.580
Fixed costs and variable

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:02.840
costs.

02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:08.540
If we summarize them, we

02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.620
get the total cost.

02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:14.000
Please look at the slide.

02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:17.900
FC is fixed cost.

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.740
VC is variable cost, variable

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.020
cost.

02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:25.820
The total cost is TC.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:29.560
Total costs of the company.

02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:35.800
It is also important to know

02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.940
the unit cost or average cost.

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:44.600
The average constant cost is indicated

02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:46.580
by the letter AFC.

02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.560
Look at the slide.

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:50.880
These are fixed costs

02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:53.000
per unit of production.

02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:57.820
AFC is equal to FC constant

02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:59.780
cost divided

02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:01.340
by Q.

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:06.980
Average variable cost, AVC,

02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:09.820
is the variable cost

02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:11.780
per unit of production.

02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:13.940
How to count them?

02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:17.340
We divide the total amount of variable costs

02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:19.000
by the volume of production.

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.880
Look at the formula.

02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:25.680
And finally, the average

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:29.920
total cost is the total cost

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.020
per unit of production.

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:34.880
How to calculate?

02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:37.720
Total cost, TC, can

02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.220
be divided by

02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:40.960
Q.

02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:43.760
Or else can be counted.

02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:46.540
Average constant and variable

02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:49.840
costs can be summed up.

02:28:53.430 --> 02:28:56.950
A very important role in economic

02:28:56.950 --> 02:29:01.170
analysis is played by marginal

02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:02.450
cost.

02:29:03.570 --> 02:29:06.270
Limit costs are the increase

02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:09.570
in total costs when the output

02:29:09.570 --> 02:29:12.630
increases by one unit.

02:29:13.090 --> 02:29:15.110
Look at the formula.

02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:20.170
mc is equal to delta TC divided by

02:29:20.170 --> 02:29:21.390
delta Q.

02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:22.990
How to understand?

02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:26.650
Let's say, you have already

02:29:26.650 --> 02:29:29.290
produced a few units.

02:29:30.810 --> 02:29:35.290
You want to produce another

02:29:35.290 --> 02:29:38.170
additional product.

02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:43.190
Another additional product.

02:29:43.690 --> 02:29:46.710
To produce an additional unit

02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:49.710
of products, additional costs

02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:52.090
must be incurred.

02:29:52.410 --> 02:29:55.690
These additional costs, which

02:29:55.970 --> 02:29:57.950
will be required by the production

02:29:57.950 --> 02:30:00.390
of an additional unit of product,

02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:04.610
are the limit costs.

02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:06.970
But look when we increase

02:30:06.970 --> 02:30:08.130
the issue?

02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:13.210
When will the total cost increase?

02:30:13.210 --> 02:30:17.370
The total costs are consisting

02:30:17.370 --> 02:30:19.770
of fixed and variable costs.

02:30:20.310 --> 02:30:23.830
Only variable costs increase.

02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:26.450
Fixed costs are not changed over

02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:30.150
a short period of time.

02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:35.610
The increase in total costs is

02:30:35.610 --> 02:30:40.750
equal to the increase in variable costs.

02:30:41.170 --> 02:30:44.010
Thus, the limit costs can be calculated

02:30:44.010 --> 02:30:47.570
by dividing the delta of the growth

02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:49.690
of variable costs, divided by the

02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:52.110
delta of the production.

02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:58.880
To understand this, I give

02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:01.140
an example of calculating

02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:02.260
the cost.

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:05.660
Please look at the slide.

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:10.280
There are two types of editions, 10 and 11.

02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:12.860
What are the constant costs?

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.780
50 all the time.

02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:18.180
They do not change with the

02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:20.440
change of the output to determine

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:21.560
the fixed cost.

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:24.440
Which are changing?

02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:26.400
The variables change.

02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.480
Suppose that 10 was

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:31.540
100 rubles, and

02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:33.960
11 was 105 rubles.

02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:38.840
All other parameters are easily calculated.

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:43.260
What is the total cost?

02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:44.920
How many were they at the 10th

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:45.680
edition?

02:31:46.580 --> 02:31:48.820
50 plus 100, that is 150.

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:52.040
They are now in the issue 11.

02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:55.400
50 plus 105 – 155.

02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:58.220
Average constant, how to calculate?

02:31:58.700 --> 02:31:59.320
very easy.

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:01.780
We divide the constant cost by the volume

02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:03.460
of the issue.

02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:06.700
50 divided by 10 is 5.

02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:10.720
5 rubles of fixed costs per unit

02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:12.980
of release at issue 10.

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:15.920
11 What will we expect?

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:17.320
50 divided by 11.

02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:20.000
It is approximately 4.55.

02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:23.920
This is the average constant cost of the

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:25.220
new volume of production.

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:30.260
Average variable costs.

02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:32.600
Variable costs for the issue.

02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:34.200
How many were?

02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:40.680
100 to 10, 10 became 105 to 11, 9 and 55.

02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:44.620
Finally, the average total cost.

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.780
How can I calculate?

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:50.360
The total cost can be divided by the volume

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.200
of the issue.

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:53.920
Average constant and average

02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:56.200
variable costs can be

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:59.660
summed up.

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.620
So, before they were how much?

02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:05.580
5 plus 10, 15 average total costs.

02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:10.020
Now they are 4, 55, 4 and 55

02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:11.780
plus 9.

02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:14.160
14 and 1.

02:33:15.980 --> 02:33:19.820
The last column contains the

02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:21.740
limit costs.

02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:23.780
Limit costs are just one

02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:25.100
value here.

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:29.140
Limit costs are the increase

02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:31.900
in total costs when production

02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:34.400
increases by one unit.

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:37.720
Increase in output 1, Increase

02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:40.540
in total costs 5.

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:43.460
5 for 1 is 5.

02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:45.640
The maximum cost

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:46.840
is 5 rubles.

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:50.300
This is an additional cost that

02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:53.040
will have to be borne if we increase

02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:55.820
the output from 10 to 11.

02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:59.560
I would like to point out that

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.360
the limit costs can also be calculated

02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:05.040
by dividing the increase in variable

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:08.280
costs by the increase in output.

02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:11.040
5 divided by 1 equals 5.

02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:16.440
Now, we go to the fourth issue of

02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:18.480
our topic.

02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.960
Costs in the short term.

02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:24.640
A short period in microeconomics

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.480
is a period during

02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:30.400
which some factors

02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.920
of production cannot be

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.320
changed and others can

02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:39.400
be changed.

02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:44.440
Capital is considered to be a constant

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.500
factor of production, and labour is

02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:49.780
considered to be a variable factor.

02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:56.530
Accordingly, capital costs in the

02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:58.230
short period are fixed costs,

02:34:58.230 --> 02:35:01.590
and labor costs in the short

02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:04.330
period are variable costs.

02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:09.880
Let's see what the costs

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.400
can be in the short term.

02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:17.280
Let's start with the constant cost.

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.120
Look at the slide again.

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:25.220
Fixed costs are those costs

02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:28.560
that do not change with the change

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:32.040
in the volume of the output.

02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:33.100
See also.

02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:36.040
The issue changes on the left chart,

02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:40.220
and the fixed costs do not change.

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:43.340
Accordingly, the function of constant costs

02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:46.080
is a straight line of the

02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.700
parallel axis x.

02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:54.090
Now let's talk about the function of average

02:35:54.090 --> 02:35:55.150
constant costs.

02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:59.470
What are the average constant costs?

02:35:59.510 --> 02:36:00.930
We have already talked about it.

02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:05.210
They are obtained by dividing the constant cost

02:36:05.210 --> 02:36:07.610
by the volume of production.

02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:11.880
The constant cost number does not change,

02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:14.940
and the volume of production denominator

02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:16.060
changes.

02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:21.300
Set any amount of constant cost.

02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:23.720
Let us suppose 10.

02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:27.830
Let the output be equal to one.

02:36:28.210 --> 02:36:30.710
What is the average constant cost?

02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:35.370
10 divided by 1 equals 10.

02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:38.390
Let us say that the output is equal to 2.

02:36:39.390 --> 02:36:41.910
The constant is not changing, and the average

02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:43.030
constant is how much?

02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:46.490
10 divided by 2 ridiculous?

02:36:46.490 --> 02:36:47.110
5 is

02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:50.480
Let the release be equal to 5.

02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:54.140
Average constant 10 divided by 5 is equal

02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:55.780
to 2?

02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:58.420
Let the output be equal to 10.

02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.580
10 divided by 10 equals 1.

02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.780
And the issue is very big.

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:10.380
Average constant costs.

02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:12.820
10 for a very large value will

02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.340
be a very small value.

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.040
Accordingly, with the growth of output,

02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.060
the average constant cost

02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:19.920
tends to zero.

02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:22.500
And in general, the function

02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:25.180
of average constant costs represents

02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:30.060
a parable that is visible on the

02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:31.720
right chart.

02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:39.150
How are they changing?

02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:41.470
What will be the functions of other costs?

02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.060
Here, there is no unambiguous answer.

02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:51.520
It all depends on the accepted conditions.

02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:54.620
Let us first consider the simplified

02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:56.780
cost functions.

02:37:57.940 --> 02:38:01.020
They are based on the assumption that

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:04.260
the limit costs are constant.

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:08.100
What does it mean that the limit costs are constant?

02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:13.530
This means that with the increase of

02:38:15.690 --> 02:38:19.610
output, the costs increase all the time

02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:21.630
by the same amount.

02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:25.250
Take the example of trade.

02:38:27.250 --> 02:38:29.650
Let us have a shop

02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:32.350
that sells beer.

02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:37.500
For trade, the volume of release

02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:40.480
is the number of goods sold,

02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:43.940
i.e. the bottles of beer sold.

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:49.650
What costs are usually

02:38:49.650 --> 02:38:52.290
variable?

02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:57.930
To sell beer, it must be purchased

02:38:57.930 --> 02:38:59.170
from a wholesaler.

02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:04.350
The more beer we sell, the

02:39:04.350 --> 02:39:07.770
more beer we have to buy.

02:39:07.770 --> 02:39:10.130
Accordingly, the cost of purchasing beer grows

02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:13.310
with the volume of sales, that is, it grows

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:15.050
with the volume of production.

02:39:15.550 --> 02:39:17.890
Therefore, for trade, the purchase

02:39:17.890 --> 02:39:20.890
costs are variable.

02:39:22.370 --> 02:39:24.830
All other costs are considered

02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:26.950
constant in trade.

02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:31.030
Those that do not change with the increase of the release.

02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:34.410
The rental fee does not change,

02:39:34.410 --> 02:39:37.090
the electricity costs do

02:39:37.090 --> 02:39:38.810
not change.

02:39:38.930 --> 02:39:40.790
If no one has bought anything from

02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:43.330
us, the rent must be paid, the store

02:39:43.330 --> 02:39:45.830
is running, the refrigerators are

02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:49.050
working, the store is illuminated.

02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:50.830
The salary of the seller will also be considered

02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:52.890
independent of the volume of the

02:39:52.890 --> 02:39:54.030
issue, that is, we will also be

02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:56.650
considered as a constant cost.

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:01.500
Look at the table.

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:05.860
My output varies from 0 to 100.

02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:08.540
The number of bottles sold

02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:10.920
varies from 0 to 100.

02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.360
The fixed cost is set

02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:14.600
at 100 rubles.

02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:18.800
They are not dependent on the release.

02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.920
The variable cost is the

02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:27.140
cost of buying beer.

02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:30.380
Suppose that each bottle of beer is

02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:33.460
purchased for 5 rubles.

02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.980
If we have not bought a bottle

02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:41.780
of beer and sold a bottle of

02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:44.440
beer, the variable cost

02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:45.480
is zero.

02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:48.480
If we bought and sold one bottle

02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:51.140
of beer, the variable cost is equal

02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:53.520
to the cost of purchasing that

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:56.440
bottle, that is, 5 rubles.

02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:59.280
We bought and sold 2 bottles of

02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:02.760
beer, the variable cost is 10 rubles

02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:05.120
and so on, 15, 20, 25 and

02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:07.020
so on and so on.

02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.020
So, variable costs are constantly

02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:13.140
increasing by how much?

02:41:14.420 --> 02:41:17.320
With each next day of release for

02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:18.920
5 rubles.

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.920
These are additional costs

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:24.800
or limit costs.

02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:29.100
See, fifth column, the limit

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:31.080
costs, all the time 5, 5,

02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:32.020
5, 5.

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:35.540
How much is the total cost?

02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:38.560
With zero-issue, variable costs

02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.800
are zero, but constant costs

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.680
still have to be borne.

02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:45.980
The total cost is

02:41:45.980 --> 02:41:47.800
100 rubles.

02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:53.120
When issuing 1 constant 100,

02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:55.480
variable 5, only 105 and so on.

02:41:58.260 --> 02:41:59.800
By known formulas, we can calculate

02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:02.500
the average constant and average

02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:05.000
variable costs, as well as

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.960
the average aggregate costs.

02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:11.240
This is what I want to draw your attention to.

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:16.520
Limit costs are constant.

02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:19.080
With each next unit of product,

02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:22.180
the limit costs increase

02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:25.880
all the time by the same

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:27.860
amount, by 5 rubles.

02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:34.010
In this case, they are equal

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:38.010
to the average variable cost.

02:42:41.260 --> 02:42:43.600
Well, in fact, if we have a output

02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:46.300
other than one, variable costs

02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:47.380
how much do we have?

02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:48.280
5 is

02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:51.580
With the release of 2 units, the variable

02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:52.600
cost is 10.

02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:56.800
With 3 units 15, with 4 - 20, with

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.000
5 - 25.

02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:01.800
The average variable cost is always

02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:03.960
equal to 5.

02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:07.960
The average variable cost, in my conditional

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:11.200
example, is exactly the purchase

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.460
price of a bottle of beer.

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:20.020
This is reflected in the next slide.

02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:21.160
See also.

02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.760
On axis X we have the output, and on axis

02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:31.020
Y - the marginal and average variable costs.

02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:33.960
The limit costs remain the same with

02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:36.400
the increase in output.

02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:40.870
And they are necessarily equal in this

02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:44.390
case to the average variable costs.

02:43:45.430 --> 02:43:48.050
Now look at how the variable

02:43:48.050 --> 02:43:51.390
and aggregate cost functions go.

02:43:55.010 --> 02:43:56.810
I have already mentioned the permanent.

02:43:57.490 --> 02:44:00.570
The function of constant costs goes parallel

02:44:00.570 --> 02:44:01.900
to the X axis.

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:05.420
Let us return to our table.

02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:11.360
Look at how the variable costs change.

02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:15.260
When the issue 0 is 0; when the issue

02:44:15.270 --> 02:44:18.100
1 is 5, when the issue 2 is 10, and so on.

02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:21.900
Variable cost function is a linear function

02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:25.840
that starts from the beginning

02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:26.980
of coordinates.

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:32.920
This is shown in the chart.

02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:37.780
How will the total cost function go?

02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:44.940
See, at issue 0 the variable

02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:47.260
costs, as we have already said,

02:44:47.270 --> 02:44:48.880
are equal to 0.

02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:53.920
But constant costs are not equal to 0

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:57.560
because they must be borne at any volume

02:44:57.570 --> 02:44:59.560
of release.

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:04.200
In the case of zero-issue, the

02:45:04.210 --> 02:45:07.300
total cost is equal to the constant.

02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:11.480
Then the total cost function.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.420
It is a linear function, a parallel

02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:17.320
function, going parallel to the

02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:18.920
variable cost function.

02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:25.480
The difference between total

02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:27.640
and variable costs is

02:45:27.650 --> 02:45:29.300
the fixed cost.

02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:31.440
This amount does not change.

02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:33.460
These two functions go parallel

02:45:33.470 --> 02:45:35.880
to each other.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.900
Let us now look at the average

02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:42.460
cost function.

02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:49.100
Remember the formula.

02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:52.500
What is the average total cost?

02:45:54.750 --> 02:46:00.190
These are the average constant costs

02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:06.100
plus the average variable costs.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.400
What do we know about average cost?

02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:17.740
With the increase of the output, they decrease

02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:20.040
and aim to zero.

02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:26.980
What do we know about the average

02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:28.540
variable cost?

02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:33.220
In this model, they do not change,

02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:35.520
they are a constant value.

02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:42.020
But if this foldable diminishes

02:46:42.030 --> 02:46:44.120
and tends to zero, and the

02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:48.980
second foldable is a constant, then

02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:51.380
what does the sum seek?

02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:00.300
The amount is aimed at the average

02:47:00.310 --> 02:47:02.000
variable cost.

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:06.460
This is shown in the chart.

02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:12.400
The higher the output, the lower

02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:15.920
the average total cost, which,

02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:18.520
however, is not aimed at zero,

02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:21.320
but is aimed at average

02:47:21.330 --> 02:47:23.760
variable costs.

02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:26.820
What...

02:47:26.830 --> 02:47:29.160
So, we can make a conclusion.

02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:36.800
The larger the output, the less

02:47:36.810 --> 02:47:39.660
the average total...

02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:42.900
Average constant and corresponding

02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:45.500
total costs.

02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:50.840
A simple question.

02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:55.780
Let's say you are studying economics as

02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:57.080
part of an MBA program.

02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:02.320
You study economics as a group.

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:05.140
Apply this last conclusion

02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:06.460
that I just made in my

02:48:06.470 --> 02:48:09.680
group.

02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:11.420
Not very difficult.

02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:18.160
What is an MBA issue for the school?

02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:23.190
The number of listeners, right?

02:48:24.730 --> 02:48:26.850
What are we watching?

02:48:27.610 --> 02:48:30.990
The more students in a group,

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.510
the less the cost of training

02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:37.270
for one student.

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:42.380
So, we have considered simplified

02:48:42.390 --> 02:48:44.480
cost functions.

02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:47.440
Such functions are usually consistent with

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:49.600
the practice of small.

02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:52.080
But very often in business

02:48:52.090 --> 02:48:54.680
you have to face the same

02:48:54.690 --> 02:48:56.540
complex cost functions.

02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:00.400
Here is another premise.

02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:04.780
Limit costs first decrease,

02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:08.420
then reach a minimum, and then

02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:10.180
begin to increase.

02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:12.120
Look at the slide.

02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:15.210
How to understand?

02:49:16.890 --> 02:49:20.670
At first, with the growth of production,

02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:23.370
each additional unit of product

02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:26.490
requires less and less additional costs.

02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:31.510
Then these additional costs

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.190
become minimal.

02:49:33.390 --> 02:49:36.530
After that, each additional unit

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:39.210
of release requires increasing

02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:40.910
additional costs.

02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:46.940
As soon as this is the case, all cost

02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:48.540
functions change.

02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:53.290
Please look at a conditional example.

02:49:53.970 --> 02:49:55.150
The next slide.

02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:58.840
Here, the output in the first

02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:02.120
column varies from zero to ten.

02:50:03.260 --> 02:50:05.300
The fixed cost by definition

02:50:05.310 --> 02:50:08.020
should not change.

02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.520
They are always 25, 25, 25.

02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:16.820
Variable costs are changing.

02:50:18.510 --> 02:50:19.550
How they change?

02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:21.190
You will see in the table.

02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:26.710
All other indicators can be calculated.

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:29.290
As always, the total cost is obtained

02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:31.590
by summing up the fixed

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:35.810
costs and the variable costs.

02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.890
have counted?

02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:39.810
See you?

02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:49.640
Let's see how the limit

02:50:49.650 --> 02:50:52.280
cost function changes.

02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:54.380
How can we calculate the

02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:56.180
limit costs?

02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:59.940
We take the increase in total costs

02:50:59.950 --> 02:51:04.460
and divide it by the increase in production.

02:51:04.470 --> 02:51:06.980
Increased release all the time of the unit.

02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:09.600
What is the total cost increase

02:51:09.610 --> 02:51:10.260
first?

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:13.140
55 minus 25 how much is it?

02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:14.900
First of 30.

02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:18.060
Then the total cost increases

02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:22.620
24, then 20 and so on.

02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:26.000
What we see means that when issued

02:51:26.010 --> 02:51:29.300
from zero to five, the limit costs

02:51:29.310 --> 02:51:32.560
are constantly decreasing, eventually

02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:34.680
reaching a value of 16.

02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:39.180
After that, starting with issue

02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:41.080
6 and so on, the limit costs

02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:43.600
begin to rise.

02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:46.500
The average and fixed costs are always

02:51:46.510 --> 02:51:47.500
decreasing.

02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:49.300
There is nothing new here.

02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:54.040
The functions of the average variable

02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:57.280
and average total costs change

02:51:57.290 --> 02:51:58.300
immediately.

02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:02.880
Look what they will be now.

02:52:07.930 --> 02:52:09.630
Here is the slide.

02:52:11.050 --> 02:52:15.950
Limit and average costs.

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:18.910
Look at what happens with

02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:20.650
the limit costs.

02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:23.760
As I said, first they decrease,

02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:26.900
then they reach the minimum, then

02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:29.860
they begin to strive, then they increase.

02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:33.200
What happens to the average

02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:35.020
variable cost?

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.600
They first fall.

02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:40.700
But they are declining, as you

02:52:40.980 --> 02:52:44.400
can see, slower than the limit costs.

02:52:44.580 --> 02:52:45.420
Then look at.

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:49.700
Within a certain period of time, the

02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:52.680
limit costs are already increasing.

02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:57.260
And the average variable costs,

02:53:00.130 --> 02:53:02.360
look carefully, they are still decreasing.

02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:08.000
And note that the average variable

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:11.760
costs decrease until they

02:53:11.770 --> 02:53:15.220
are even above the limit costs.

02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:18.200
Hence the most important conclusion.

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.280
The average variable cost

02:53:23.290 --> 02:53:26.180
reaches its minimum at

02:53:26.190 --> 02:53:31.040
the point where it is equal to

02:53:31.050 --> 02:53:32.720
the limit cost.

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:40.460
Finally, let's look at the average

02:53:40.470 --> 02:53:42.260
total cost function.

02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:48.640
This function comes out of infinity.

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:51.500
For an infinite small quantity,

02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:53.880
the average total cost is very large

02:53:53.890 --> 02:53:56.140
because the output is very small.

02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:58.480
Next What?

02:53:59.420 --> 02:54:03.440
They decline and also necessarily

02:54:03.450 --> 02:54:07.160
reach their minimum at the point where

02:54:07.220 --> 02:54:11.240
they are equal to the limit costs.

02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:14.820
The function of the limit costs necessarily

02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:18.640
crosses the functions of the average

02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:21.060
variable and the average total

02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:25.380
cost at the points of their minimum.

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:30.360
Once the minimum point is

02:54:30.370 --> 02:54:33.040
passed, the average total

02:54:33.050 --> 02:54:36.840
cost begins to rise.

02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:41.920
As they increase, they are constantly

02:54:41.930 --> 02:54:45.940
approaching the function of

02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:47.440
average variable costs.

02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:50.660
Think, why is it so?

02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:55.980
The average total cost is equal

02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:58.340
to what we have already mentioned,

02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:08.360
the average constant cost, plus

02:55:08.370 --> 02:55:12.060
the average variable cost.

02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:15.440
What are the average constant

02:55:15.450 --> 02:55:16.220
costs?

02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:19.230
to zero.

02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:20.770
I have said this many times.

02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:25.470
The average variable cost

02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:30.330
is the average total cost.

02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:34.030
Well, this is actually all about

02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:36.530
the fourth issue of this topic –

02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:38.190
the cost in the short term.

02:55:40.140 --> 02:55:42.560
There is another fifth issue on the subject

02:55:42.570 --> 02:55:44.580
– the costs in the long term.

02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:47.240
There will be nothing new there,

02:55:47.250 --> 02:55:50.360
except that I just want

02:55:50.370 --> 02:55:53.760
to emphasize that there

02:55:53.770 --> 02:55:58.020
are no constant costs in

02:55:58.030 --> 02:55:59.200
the long run.

02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:03.280
All costs are variable.

02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:03.800
Why is?

02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:10.340
Because in the long run, the company

02:56:10.350 --> 02:56:13.640
can change all the factors of production.

02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:15.260
She can find additional

02:56:15.270 --> 02:56:17.460
workers, she can install additional

02:56:17.470 --> 02:56:19.420
equipment, she can rent

02:56:19.430 --> 02:56:22.840
a more spacious

02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:24.180
building.

02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:26.880
All factors of production

02:56:26.890 --> 02:56:29.040
become variable, so all

02:56:29.050 --> 02:56:32.600
costs also become variable.

02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:36.920
There is no function of average

02:56:36.930 --> 02:56:37.960
constant cost.

02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:40.180
Is there only a function?

02:56:41.020 --> 02:56:43.860
The function of the limit costs is the function

02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:45.820
of the average cost.

02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:47.860
And it will be the same.

02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:50.500
The function of the limit costs first

02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:53.740
decreases, then reaches a minimum,

02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:56.460
then begins to increase.

02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:59.560
The average total cost function first

02:56:59.570 --> 02:57:02.560
decreases, then reaches the minimum

02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:04.680
at the point of intersection

02:57:04.690 --> 02:57:07.860
with the limit cost function.

02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:10.200
After that, the average total

02:57:10.210 --> 02:57:13.860
cost function begins to increase.

02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:24.050
Let us start with the fourth topic

02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:25.570
of our course.

02:57:26.490 --> 02:57:29.790
Market Structures and Company Behavior.

02:57:30.210 --> 02:57:33.370
Here we will talk about how the company

02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:35.470
operates in certain market

02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:37.070
conditions.

02:57:38.430 --> 02:57:40.330
And it is probably obvious

02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:43.470
that the behavior of a company depends

02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:45.390
not only on the amount of

02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:48.290
resources it has, but also on the

02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:51.130
market environment in which it operates.

02:57:51.810 --> 02:57:54.410
In other words, the behavior of the company

02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:56.190
depends on the type of market.

02:57:56.910 --> 02:57:59.090
Please look at the slide.

02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:01.270
The first question we will discuss

02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:03.310
with you is called “types of

02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:05.650
market structures”.

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:09.070
Or it will be about types of markets.

02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:13.940
Please see, there is...

02:58:13.950 --> 02:58:16.400
Microeconomics distinguishes four types

02:58:16.410 --> 02:58:19.020
of market structures or forms of market

02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:20.700
organization.

02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:24.700
This is perfect competition,

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:28.380
monopoly, oligopoly,

02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:30.700
monopolistic competition.

02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:38.110
Let's start with perfect competition.

02:58:39.470 --> 02:58:41.730
Well, very often perfect

02:58:41.740 --> 02:58:44.130
competition is misunderstood.

02:58:44.490 --> 02:58:46.190
They think that perfect

02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:50.320
competition is something like

02:58:50.330 --> 02:58:52.840
absolutely harsh, ruthless

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:54.520
competition.

02:58:54.580 --> 02:58:57.180
Actually nothing like that.

02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.520
The definition is very simple.

02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:02.800
Perfect competition is a market

02:59:02.810 --> 02:59:06.640
structure in which there are

02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:10.140
so many sellers and buyers that

02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:15.180
none of them can influence the

02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:18.140
market price by changing

02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:20.820
the volume of their

02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:23.080
supply or demand.

02:59:24.470 --> 02:59:26.370
The price of a product in a completely

02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:29.010
competitive market is determined by

02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:32.070
the interaction of thousands of independent

02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:36.190
buyers and hundreds of independent sellers.

02:59:36.670 --> 02:59:38.450
Every buyer and every seller

02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:41.270
is a piece of sand on the scale

02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:44.230
of the market, which can not change

02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:47.130
anything in the market by

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:48.990
its behavior.

02:59:49.390 --> 02:59:53.030
Let's look at the signs of

02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:54.690
perfect competition.

02:59:57.130 --> 02:59:59.230
Well, I actually said about the

02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:00.170
first sign.

03:00:00.250 --> 03:00:01.950
Here is a sign.

03:00:02.430 --> 03:00:04.010
Each of the very large numbers

03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:06.310
of sellers and buyers has such a

03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:08.910
small market share that they cannot

03:00:08.920 --> 03:00:11.070
change the market price by their

03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:14.310
behavior, but can sell or buy

03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:17.810
as many products as they want

03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:20.190
at that price.

03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:27.120
Let me give you an example, I think it

03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:29.160
will be appropriate.

03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:32.720
Here is a friend who lives

03:00:32.730 --> 03:00:35.540
in the Volgograd province, calls me in

03:00:35.550 --> 03:00:38.220
Moscow and asks what tomatoes in

03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:39.120
Moscow are for?

03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:43.280
The case was in the summer and not last

03:00:43.290 --> 03:00:46.560
year, I don't remember what I answered,

03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:48.820
well, let's say, 10 rubles per kilogram.

03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:52.440
She had an unfettered curiosity.

03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:55.780
She was going to bring a truck

03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:57.660
with Volga tomatoes to Moscow.

03:01:01.170 --> 03:01:02.770
So, what did she come from, having

03:01:02.910 --> 03:01:04.850
received my information, the price

03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:07.870
of tomatoes in Moscow 10 rubles per kilogram?

03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:15.520
It was based on the fact that

03:01:15.530 --> 03:01:17.380
if today the price is so, its appearance

03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:21.500
or not appearance on the

03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:25.520
market can not affect the price.

03:01:25.530 --> 03:01:31.250
But on the other hand, she is confident

03:01:31.630 --> 03:01:33.170
that since she holds a tiny

03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:35.230
share of the tomato market, she

03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:38.690
will be able to sell any quantity

03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:40.190
of her tomatoes at this price,

03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:41.670
10 rubles per kilogram.

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:46.300
That is, and a ton, and three, and even

03:01:46.310 --> 03:01:48.380
five, and more, she just has no.

03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:51.480
It is clear that if she brought to

03:01:51.490 --> 03:01:54.120
Moscow at the same time, say,

03:01:54.130 --> 03:01:56.820
thousands of tons of tomatoes, then

03:01:56.830 --> 03:01:59.460
such a large seller would necessarily

03:01:59.470 --> 03:02:01.220
influence the market price.

03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:03.620
But that would no longer be a condition

03:02:03.630 --> 03:02:04.880
for perfect competition.

03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:08.160
Under perfect competition, market

03:02:08.170 --> 03:02:10.440
price is determined by the interaction

03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:14.610
of thousands of independent

03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:18.550
buyers, hundreds of independent

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:21.070
sellers, each piece of

03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:24.310
sand on the general market

03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:26.930
scale, and no one alone

03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:28.710
can influence the price.

03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:31.290
Another example, so that it might

03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:32.790
be better understood.

03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:39.070
You encountered a neighbor at the entrance.

03:02:39.450 --> 03:02:42.250
He comes from the bazar.

03:02:43.310 --> 03:02:45.630
You ask him what tomatoes are for?

03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:49.930
He responds, 10 rubles per kilogram.

03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:53.550
So what are you coming from?

03:02:53.810 --> 03:02:56.230
How soon did that price come up?

03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:59.910
Your appearance or not appearing

03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:02.830
on the market as a buyer

03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:05.830
again can not affect the price.

03:03:06.470 --> 03:03:08.650
But you can buy at this price, for 10

03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:10.970
rubles, and a kilogram, and 3, and

03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:12.490
5, and even 10.

03:03:13.410 --> 03:03:15.810
That is, you also feel like

03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:17.770
a perfect competitor

03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:19.630
in the tomato market, but

03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:21.910
not as a seller, but as a buyer.

03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:26.210
Let's look at the schedule.

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:32.560
Balanced market price and demand curve

03:03:32.570 --> 03:03:35.000
for a product of a particular firm.

03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:37.500
Look at two schedules.

03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:41.640
The left chart illustrates the demand

03:03:41.650 --> 03:03:43.300
for supply in a completely

03:03:43.310 --> 03:03:44.740
competitive market.

03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:47.040
I repeat again.

03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:50.240
There are thousands of buyers and hundreds

03:03:50.250 --> 03:03:52.160
of independent sellers.

03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:56.380
On the X-axis we place the total

03:03:56.390 --> 03:03:58.460
number of tomatoes sold and purchased

03:03:58.470 --> 03:04:00.220
on this market.

03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:01.440
And what do we see?

03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:06.580
That at the price P with the star

03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:10.420
we have some market balance.

03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:12.800
Demand on the tomato market

03:04:12.810 --> 03:04:14.940
from all buyers is equal to

03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:16.900
the supply on this market

03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:18.320
from all sellers.

03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:21.380
Now look at the right schedule.

03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:25.620
You see, on the X axis I postpone and

03:04:25.630 --> 03:04:27.580
indicate the output, production, volume

03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:29.440
of the cumal.

03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:33.720
It is a separate company.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.080
This is, in a way, my tomato

03:04:36.090 --> 03:04:37.500
acquaintance.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:41.160
If on the left chart the bill goes for

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:43.740
thousands of tons, then on the right

03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:45.580
chart it only goes for tons.

03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:48.940
It is a sandstone on a market scale.

03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:52.620
And it takes the existing

03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:57.180
market price P with a star as a set.

03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:00.080
As economists say, it is

03:05:00.090 --> 03:05:05.060
a price-taker, the price recipient.

03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:08.330
She takes this price as

03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:10.850
a set and can sell any quantity

03:05:10.860 --> 03:05:14.530
of her tomatoes at that price.

03:05:16.610 --> 03:05:18.950
Note that in perfect competition,

03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:22.070
it cannot raise the

03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:23.430
price.

03:05:24.250 --> 03:05:26.710
No one will buy tomatoes.

03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:30.150
What's the point of having hundreds

03:05:30.160 --> 03:05:32.230
of sellers with a lower price?

03:05:32.970 --> 03:05:36.010
And it makes no sense to lower

03:05:36.330 --> 03:05:39.070
the price, because at this price

03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:41.170
she can sell any amount of

03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:41.950
her tomatoes.

03:05:43.280 --> 03:05:46.100
It was you and I who saw the first

03:05:46.110 --> 03:05:48.400
sign of perfect competition.

03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:52.420
Let us go back to our signs,

03:05:52.430 --> 03:05:55.900
let us look at the second sign.

03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:58.760
Full homogeneity of products,

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:00.560
lack of trademarks.

03:06:01.520 --> 03:06:02.580
What does this mean?

03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:09.470
The products of different sellers

03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:11.610
are completely the same in

03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:13.050
the representation of buyers.

03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:16.830
Buyers do not distinguish the product

03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:19.310
of one seller from another and

03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:21.690
the seller himself from the other.

03:06:22.110 --> 03:06:23.670
But when you come to the real

03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:25.750
tomato market, agree, you will

03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:27.130
still walk in the rows, you

03:06:27.530 --> 03:06:28.530
will watch.

03:06:28.990 --> 03:06:30.910
Here, it seems tomatoes are

03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:33.850
red, but this seller seems

03:06:33.860 --> 03:06:36.310
to break a little confidence.

03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:38.630
This is not possible

03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:40.330
in perfect competition.

03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:44.390
All sellers on one person and all

03:06:44.400 --> 03:06:46.990
products are absolutely the same,

03:06:47.130 --> 03:06:48.150
no differences.

03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:52.550
Look at the third sign.

03:06:53.050 --> 03:06:55.470
Free entry and access

03:06:55.480 --> 03:06:57.730
to the market.

03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:02.560
This means that there are no barriers,

03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:05.200
financial, administrative,

03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:07.420
any, that prevented it from

03:07:07.430 --> 03:07:09.800
entering the market of new sellers

03:07:09.810 --> 03:07:13.260
or the departure of sellers

03:07:13.270 --> 03:07:15.180
from this market.

03:07:17.340 --> 03:07:20.940
Let us try this example for the

03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:23.980
discharge.

03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:27.860
Somewhere I read that our current

03:07:27.870 --> 03:07:31.020
president Vladimir Putin in his

03:07:33.390 --> 03:07:35.340
temporary, worked private transportation

03:07:35.350 --> 03:07:37.940
on his jigul.

03:07:38.200 --> 03:07:39.480
What did it mean?

03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:41.640
That he just one day sat down

03:07:41.650 --> 03:07:44.100
at the wheel of his car, went

03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:45.920
to the streets of St. Petersburg,

03:07:45.930 --> 03:07:49.000
that is, entered the private

03:07:49.010 --> 03:07:50.400
market.

03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:54.640
A while later, Vladimir Vladimirovich

03:07:54.650 --> 03:07:56.820
found an interesting job

03:07:56.830 --> 03:07:59.260
as President of Russia.

03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:02.300
This means only that he quietly

03:08:02.310 --> 03:08:04.000
put his jigguls in the garage

03:08:04.010 --> 03:08:06.380
and went to work in the Kremlin.

03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:08.820
As easily he entered the market,

03:08:08.830 --> 03:08:11.860
so easily he left it.

03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:14.280
This is a sign of perfect competition.

03:08:14.540 --> 03:08:16.660
There are no barriers to entry

03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:17.300
and exit.

03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:21.380
The fourth sign.

03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:24.700
Perfect knowledge of the market

03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:28.360
by sellers and buyers.

03:08:28.540 --> 03:08:31.580
Again, if you come to the real

03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:36.300
tomato market, then you'll

03:08:36.310 --> 03:08:38.980
probably walk in the rows,

03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:40.580
again, looking.

03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:42.960
Maybe there are tomatoes

03:08:42.970 --> 03:08:45.640
better or a little cheaper.

03:08:47.170 --> 03:08:48.430
This is not possible in

03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:49.550
perfect competition.

03:08:50.330 --> 03:08:55.050
All sellers and all buyers are there.

03:08:55.330 --> 03:08:58.250
They seem to be together at one point.

03:08:58.330 --> 03:09:00.410
All market information

03:09:00.420 --> 03:09:03.130
is instantly disclosed.

03:09:03.430 --> 03:09:05.910
It is equally available to

03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:07.670
all sellers and all buyers.

03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:13.640
Well, if you summarize all that

03:09:13.650 --> 03:09:16.240
I said, you will probably

03:09:16.380 --> 03:09:18.960
agree that perfect competition

03:09:18.970 --> 03:09:21.860
is abstraction.

03:09:23.020 --> 03:09:27.480
Such a market does not really exist.

03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:31.280
There are markets that are more or

03:09:31.290 --> 03:09:34.880
less close to this ideal, but there

03:09:34.890 --> 03:09:35.960
is no perfectly competitive

03:09:35.970 --> 03:09:37.360
market in reality.

03:09:39.130 --> 03:09:39.710
Then the question.

03:09:40.850 --> 03:09:42.690
If there are no competitive

03:09:42.700 --> 03:09:45.550
markets, why study them?

03:09:46.230 --> 03:09:48.290
The answer is very simple.

03:09:48.510 --> 03:09:51.690
For the same reason that the chemist

03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:53.550
studies the properties of, for

03:09:54.090 --> 03:09:55.890
example, absolutely pure distilled

03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:58.550
water, which nature does not exist either.

03:09:59.690 --> 03:10:03.230
It is simply impossible to understand

03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:06.050
the properties of any impurities unless

03:10:06.060 --> 03:10:09.630
we understand, not study the subject in

03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:10.610
some perfect state.

03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:13.810
I was talking about the first type of

03:10:13.910 --> 03:10:15.910
market, perfect competition.

03:10:16.650 --> 03:10:20.030
The second type of market is called monopoly.

03:10:22.050 --> 03:10:23.430
Read the definition.

03:10:24.250 --> 03:10:25.890
Monopoly is a market structure

03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:29.490
in which there is only one company

03:10:29.500 --> 03:10:33.070
in the market that produces

03:10:33.290 --> 03:10:37.350
a product that has no close

03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:38.410
substitute.

03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:44.410
Monopolies are found at

03:10:44.420 --> 03:10:47.950
the national, regional, most often

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:51.190
at the local level.

03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:53.370
In Russia there are national

03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:55.590
monopolies.

03:10:55.890 --> 03:10:59.750
In particular, after the reform

03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:03.070
of RAUIS, the federal network

03:11:03.080 --> 03:11:05.970
company will monopolize

03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:08.590
the power transmission lines.

03:11:10.170 --> 03:11:13.210
Or, say, in our country,

03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:16.730
it is a national monopoly,

03:11:17.070 --> 03:11:21.030
or, say, in our city there is

03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:25.250
only one company offering certain

03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:26.130
services.

03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:29.050
It is a monopoly on the local.

03:11:30.970 --> 03:11:33.810
But the next market structure

03:11:33.820 --> 03:11:37.330
is more common - oligopoly.

03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:40.500
What is it?

03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:42.060
See the definition.

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:45.700
Oligopoly is a market structure

03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:49.100
characterized by a small

03:11:49.110 --> 03:11:52.780
number of operating firms.

03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:58.350
Examples of oligopoly.

03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:02.830
Two airlines on one

03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:03.750
route.

03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:07.750
In Moscow, the mobile market is controlled,

03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:10.950
if I am not mistaken, by four

03:12:11.690 --> 03:12:12.810
companies.

03:12:12.890 --> 03:12:16.090
Oligopoly is defined as a situation where there

03:12:16.100 --> 03:12:20.390
are less than 20 companies in the market.

03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:21.430
This is considered

03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:23.530
an oligopolistic structure.

03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:25.950
This is a very common case

03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:28.290
of oligopoly.

03:12:29.610 --> 03:12:32.270
Oligopoly is a very interesting

03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:33.250
market structure.

03:12:36.450 --> 03:12:38.150
When we looked at

03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:40.310
perfect competition,

03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:44.330
we saw that when a single

03:12:44.340 --> 03:12:47.650
seller makes a decision,

03:12:47.660 --> 03:12:49.990
he does not look at

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.630
other sellers.

03:12:53.010 --> 03:12:54.790
He is a sandstone on the scale of the

03:12:54.800 --> 03:12:56.470
market, he simply accepts the

03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:58.570
market price.

03:12:58.650 --> 03:13:01.190
The monopoly does not look at competitors,

03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:03.330
either, for the simple reason

03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:05.330
that they simply do not exist in

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:06.070
the monopoly.

03:13:06.270 --> 03:13:11.550
But the olegopolist acts as his

03:13:12.210 --> 03:13:16.210
own capabilities and the behavior

03:13:16.220 --> 03:13:19.730
of other firms allow him.

03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:24.040
The olegopolistic situation

03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:26.320
is similar to a kind of card game

03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:31.540
where there is no single pre-

03:13:31.550 --> 03:13:33.380
set model of behavior.

03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:36.740
Each player plays as the

03:13:36.750 --> 03:13:40.780
cards are allowed and as the

03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:42.540
competitors play.

03:13:43.180 --> 03:13:45.160
In the context of oligopoly,

03:13:45.170 --> 03:13:48.760
strategic behavior is formed.

03:13:51.430 --> 03:13:56.730
At the same time, individual olegopolists

03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:59.030
can choose one or another form of

03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:01.470
rivalry, one or another strategy

03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:04.770
of rivalry or adopt a strategy

03:14:04.780 --> 03:14:07.810
of conspiracy.

03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:08.930
So happens too.

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:14.320
The fourth type of market

03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:16.460
is monopolistic competition.

03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:18.580
Read the definition.

03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:21.780
Monopolistic competition is a

03:14:21.790 --> 03:14:24.500
market structure in which

03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:27.600
a group of goods that are close

03:14:27.610 --> 03:14:29.560
substituents are produced

03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:32.180
by a large number of independent

03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:34.660
firms.

03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:36.000
Try to explain.

03:14:38.260 --> 03:14:40.360
Let us remember the perfect

03:14:40.370 --> 03:14:42.560
competition.

03:14:43.820 --> 03:14:46.620
There were a lot of firms there.

03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:50.380
In theory, it is infinite.

03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:54.480
In the conditions of monopolistic

03:14:54.490 --> 03:14:56.980
competition, may not be so

03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:58.440
many, but also very many.

03:14:58.940 --> 03:15:02.120
But there are fundamental differences.

03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:04.680
Remember, I said that in perfect

03:15:04.690 --> 03:15:09.020
competition, the products of individual

03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:11.780
firms are absolutely indistinguishable

03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:14.720
in the eyes of the buyers.

03:15:14.980 --> 03:15:17.020
The companies are completely the same.

03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:19.300
This is not the case

03:15:19.310 --> 03:15:20.900
with monopolistic competition.

03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:25.840
Here, each company has a certain distinction

03:15:25.850 --> 03:15:30.720
that distinguishes it, its products

03:15:30.730 --> 03:15:35.140
or its own from other firms.

03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:45.140
It is a mini monopoly.

03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:48.380
It is a mini-monopoly in a very narrow

03:15:48.390 --> 03:15:50.960
segment of the market.

03:15:50.970 --> 03:15:51.740
Here is example.

03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:55.900
There are many cafes in our city, but

03:15:55.910 --> 03:16:00.180
I distinguish this cafe from what.

03:16:00.660 --> 03:16:02.820
Maybe it's a cafe, I think, maybe

03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:05.240
it's a better place to eat in this

03:16:05.250 --> 03:16:07.060
cafe, maybe there's a more

03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:09.480
sympathetic waitress, maybe the

03:16:09.490 --> 03:16:11.900
interior is more attractive, or

03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:13.120
maybe this cafe is just

03:16:13.130 --> 03:16:15.000
located closer to my home.

03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:20.200
That is, in the conditions

03:16:20.210 --> 03:16:22.640
of monopolistic competition, I repeat

03:16:22.650 --> 03:16:26.900
again, individual firms, possessing

03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:29.580
some distinctive features,

03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:32.140
possess a small but still

03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:34.160
monopolistic power in

03:16:34.170 --> 03:16:36.600
a narrow segment of the

03:16:36.610 --> 03:16:37.780
market.

03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:42.700
And now look, it is necessary

03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:46.460
to distinguish between pure

03:16:46.470 --> 03:16:52.240
monopoly and monopoly power.

03:16:53.060 --> 03:16:55.900
Monopoly power arises where

03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:00.560
a single firm has some

03:17:00.570 --> 03:17:02.960
control over the price.

03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:11.510
It can change the price within

03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:15.050
certain limits.

03:17:16.610 --> 03:17:18.970
This is not the case with perfect competition.

03:17:19.390 --> 03:17:22.890
Please look at the left schedule.

03:17:23.370 --> 03:17:25.010
On the left is a very competitive

03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:26.970
company.

03:17:27.350 --> 03:17:29.750
I have already said that in perfect

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:32.570
competition, a single firm,

03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:35.830
being a sandstone on the general

03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:38.130
market scale, can sell

03:17:38.140 --> 03:17:40.290
any quantity of its products

03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:43.430
at the market price.

03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:46.770
The function of demand for a product

03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:49.390
of a completely competitive company

03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:51.670
is a horizontal line.

03:17:52.050 --> 03:17:56.150
The market can buy any quantity

03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:59.190
of its products at the current

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:01.130
market price.

03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:03.790
Changing the price of a completely

03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:06.310
competitive company cannot by definition.

03:18:07.130 --> 03:18:08.670
But a firm with a monopoly

03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:11.110
power may change the price to

03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.170
a greater or lesser extent.

03:18:13.350 --> 03:18:15.750
Please look at the right schedule.

03:18:15.890 --> 03:18:17.810
There, the demand function for the

03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:20.470
company's product has a negative slope.

03:18:23.220 --> 03:18:26.520
This means that the company can

03:18:26.530 --> 03:18:28.980
raise or lower the price.

03:18:28.990 --> 03:18:33.560
But it is clear that by raising the

03:18:33.660 --> 03:18:35.600
price, it will face a decrease in

03:18:35.610 --> 03:18:37.440
demand for its product.

03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:43.160
And if the price is lower, it will face its increase.

03:18:43.660 --> 03:18:46.420
No super monopoly can abolish

03:18:46.430 --> 03:18:49.560
the laws of demand.

03:18:49.570 --> 03:18:53.840
But what is obvious is that it is important

03:18:53.850 --> 03:18:58.480
that the more the slope of demand

03:18:58.490 --> 03:19:02.740
for a company's product, the lower

03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:04.880
its monopoly power.

03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:11.780
So I have just said that by the inclination

03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:15.580
of the demand function on a firm'

03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:19.120
s product, one can judge how

03:19:19.130 --> 03:19:21.400
great its monopoly power is.

03:19:32.230 --> 03:19:33.170
Well, please look at the quantity of the

03:19:33.550 --> 03:19:34.770
goods, as always, the price of the goods,

03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:41.640
and let's say the function of demand

03:19:41.650 --> 03:19:43.800
is going like this.

03:19:47.780 --> 03:19:49.650
Look what it means.

03:19:49.690 --> 03:19:51.990
You see, the function has a

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:53.210
fairly high tilt.

03:19:58.440 --> 03:20:03.320
So, a firm can raise the price quite

03:20:03.330 --> 03:20:06.820
significantly from P0 to P1, see,

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.060
a significant price increase, without

03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:13.440
fear of losing a large volume

03:20:13.450 --> 03:20:14.420
of demand.

03:20:24.960 --> 03:20:29.040
In other words, it is difficult for the consumer

03:20:29.050 --> 03:20:31.460
to do without the product of this company.

03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:35.180
Even with a large price rise, the

03:20:35.190 --> 03:20:38.620
fall in demand will be minor.

03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:42.800
We say that the company

03:20:42.810 --> 03:20:45.520
has a high monopoly power.

03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:49.670
Now imagine a monopoly

03:20:49.680 --> 03:20:51.910
competitive company.

03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:55.750
The function of demand for its product goes

03:20:55.760 --> 03:20:57.570
very much by logo.

03:21:02.910 --> 03:21:06.710
So, the company can raise the price.

03:21:06.730 --> 03:21:09.730
This is the demand function for its product.

03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:12.010
But note, the company has

03:21:12.330 --> 03:21:16.050
raised the price very slightly.

03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:19.210
How much did you lose in demand?

03:21:22.170 --> 03:21:23.330
very much.

03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:27.170
A slight price increase has led

03:21:27.180 --> 03:21:29.770
to a significant decline in demand.

03:21:29.780 --> 03:21:30.630
Why so?

03:21:31.450 --> 03:21:33.510
In the context of monopolistic

03:21:33.520 --> 03:21:36.170
competition, the product

03:21:36.180 --> 03:21:38.490
has many substitutes.

03:21:39.130 --> 03:21:41.490
Therefore, with a slight increase

03:21:41.500 --> 03:21:45.250
in the price, buyers can easily switch

03:21:45.260 --> 03:21:50.370
to the product of other companies.

03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:53.540
What extreme case?

03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:57.520
The perfect competition.

03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:01.020
When the line of demand for the

03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:05.220
company's product becomes such a slope

03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:10.640
that it becomes horizontal.

03:22:11.580 --> 03:22:13.600
The company has no

03:22:13.610 --> 03:22:15.560
control over the market

03:22:15.570 --> 03:22:16.920
price.

03:22:17.140 --> 03:22:21.740
He can only accept the price.

03:22:21.750 --> 03:22:27.560
Now let us look at the reasons

03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:30.220
why monopoly power

03:22:30.230 --> 03:22:34.180
can arise and exist.

03:22:34.540 --> 03:22:38.440
I identify three reasons.

03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:40.760
The first reason is very simple.

03:22:40.820 --> 03:22:43.000
Exclusive rights

03:22:43.010 --> 03:22:45.400
granted by authorities.

03:22:47.260 --> 03:22:50.000
Well, let's say, local

03:22:50.010 --> 03:22:53.240
or regional authorities,

03:22:53.250 --> 03:22:56.500
or all-Russian authorities, only my

03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:59.640
firm is allowed to engage in this

03:22:59.650 --> 03:23:00.620
type of activity.

03:23:01.300 --> 03:23:03.580
Other companies simply do not

03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:05.480
get the appropriate license.

03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:10.580
This leads to an administrative

03:23:10.590 --> 03:23:12.740
monopoly.

03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:17.860
If the license is granted to several

03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:23.080
companies, we are given an administrative oligopoly.

03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:26.320
Now let us talk about the second reason

03:23:26.330 --> 03:23:30.040
for the existence of monopoly power.

03:23:30.940 --> 03:23:33.640
It is the exclusive ownership

03:23:33.650 --> 03:23:36.140
of any production resource.

03:23:36.540 --> 03:23:39.160
I have said many times that

03:23:39.170 --> 03:23:41.500
to do something, you need

03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:42.880
resources.

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:45.500
Imagine, please, that some important

03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:48.140
resource for the production

03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:52.380
of this product is in the

03:23:52.390 --> 03:23:54.420
exclusive property

03:23:54.430 --> 03:23:57.440
of this firm.

03:23:57.960 --> 03:23:59.980
Only she can produce

03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:01.540
this product.

03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:03.800
Others can't, and our company

03:24:03.810 --> 03:24:06.920
is a monopolist.

03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:08.420
The example.

03:24:10.840 --> 03:24:13.440
Alcoa was once the monopoly

03:24:13.450 --> 03:24:16.820
on the American aluminum

03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:18.700
market.

03:24:19.020 --> 03:24:21.280
Her monopoly was based on

03:24:21.290 --> 03:24:23.580
the fact that she alone

03:24:23.590 --> 03:24:26.040
owned all the bacit fields

03:24:26.050 --> 03:24:27.420
in Chile.

03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:33.580
Only a surgeon can perform

03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:35.680
this operation.

03:24:36.500 --> 03:24:42.260
He is the monopolist of his talent.

03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:44.480
Only he has the teaching talent,

03:24:44.490 --> 03:24:47.420
and on this basis there

03:24:47.430 --> 03:24:49.700
is a monopoly.

03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:58.360
Or only this company has a patent

03:24:58.370 --> 03:25:00.300
on the latest technological

03:25:00.310 --> 03:25:02.000
development.

03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:05.980
It is becoming a monopoly.

03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:09.020
If a resource belongs to

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:11.460
several firms, it is no longer

03:25:13.660 --> 03:25:17.560
a monopoly, but an oligopoly.

03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:24.620
The third reason for monopoly power

03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:29.160
is the increasing return on scale.

03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:31.500
Here it is a little more difficult.

03:25:32.700 --> 03:25:36.560
Let us remember what is

03:25:36.570 --> 03:25:40.300
increasing return on scale.

03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:42.160
What does she mean?

03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:43.960
When does it emerge?

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:46.120
When do we talk about increasing

03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:47.660
scale?

03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:54.640
When the number of resources

03:25:54.650 --> 03:25:57.820
used increases by N times, production

03:25:57.830 --> 03:26:01.520
increases by more than

03:26:01.530 --> 03:26:03.220
N times.

03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:05.400
We talked about this, if you remember,

03:26:05.410 --> 03:26:07.240
in the previous topic.

03:26:09.060 --> 03:26:11.900
But if there is an increasing return

03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:14.580
on scale, it means that

03:26:14.590 --> 03:26:21.200
the larger the output, the less

03:26:23.550 --> 03:26:26.710
the company costs per unit

03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:27.850
of products.

03:26:28.690 --> 03:26:30.350
Think really.

03:26:32.260 --> 03:26:39.380
The company is twice as large

03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:42.160
as a small company.

03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:45.880
It uses twice as much labor

03:26:45.890 --> 03:26:47.560
and capital.

03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:52.960
And the output of it increases by three times

03:26:52.970 --> 03:26:53.900
at the same time.

03:26:54.800 --> 03:26:58.120
This means that the unit

03:26:58.130 --> 03:27:01.380
cost of the product will be less.

03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:07.940
So, in this case, the larger the volume

03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:13.280
of production, the less the cost per

03:27:13.290 --> 03:27:15.880
unit of products.

03:27:18.340 --> 03:27:23.740
Once that happens, the companies are starting to grow.

03:27:24.720 --> 03:27:26.260
In fact, look at it.

03:27:26.270 --> 03:27:31.360
Here is the beginning of the twentieth century.

03:27:32.460 --> 03:27:34.420
Dozens of independent companies

03:27:34.430 --> 03:27:37.340
operated in the United

03:27:37.350 --> 03:27:38.420
States.

03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:41.000
What happens next?

03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:47.380
With the cash, several firms have grown.

03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:51.880
The amount of resources increased in

03:27:51.890 --> 03:27:54.360
them, well, suppose, conditionally twice.

03:27:56.160 --> 03:27:59.820
The output has increased four

03:27:59.830 --> 03:28:00.540
times.

03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.320
So, the larger company

03:28:04.330 --> 03:28:07.580
costs per unit of product.

03:28:08.100 --> 03:28:10.500
Less than smaller companies.

03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:11.940
What does this lead to?

03:28:12.620 --> 03:28:14.980
Big companies are growing,

03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:17.960
small companies are breaking down.

03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:21.040
In the end, there may be

03:28:21.050 --> 03:28:23.640
only one company on

03:28:23.650 --> 03:28:24.820
the market.

03:28:25.780 --> 03:28:28.440
If there are several companies in the market,

03:28:28.450 --> 03:28:34.900
we are talking about a natural oligopoly.

03:28:35.260 --> 03:28:37.400
See the definition

03:28:37.700 --> 03:28:42.360
of natural monopoly.

03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.320
The natural monopoly.

03:28:45.940 --> 03:28:49.120
A natural monopoly is a company

03:28:49.130 --> 03:28:53.140
that can meet any market demand

03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:56.160
with small and lower long-

03:28:56.170 --> 03:28:58.040
term average costs than those

03:28:58.050 --> 03:29:00.440
that would have been

03:29:00.450 --> 03:29:03.580
created if two or more

03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:06.560
companies were in the

03:29:06.570 --> 03:29:08.320
market instead.

03:29:10.500 --> 03:29:13.520
What is the nature of

03:29:13.530 --> 03:29:14.760
natural monopoly?

03:29:16.540 --> 03:29:20.310
The fact that its special monopoly

03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:24.590
position is not based on

03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:27.870
administrative resources, not

03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:29.690
on some other factors that can be

03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:34.590
eliminated in principle, and

03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:38.290
its monopoly position is based

03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:41.230
on the cost advantages.

03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:42.850
Hence an important conclusion.

03:29:43.710 --> 03:29:45.890
It is pointless to fight

03:29:45.900 --> 03:29:49.900
against natural monopoly by its scaling.

03:29:49.900 --> 03:29:56.500
If we create two instead of one

03:29:56.510 --> 03:29:58.340
large firm, which is a natural

03:30:00.420 --> 03:30:03.410
monopoly, the production of

03:30:03.420 --> 03:30:06.650
each will be twice as small as that

03:30:06.970 --> 03:30:08.110
of a large firm.

03:30:10.390 --> 03:30:13.790
The cost will be higher

03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:15.790
per unit of product.

03:30:17.520 --> 03:30:19.520
Well, here I will try

03:30:19.530 --> 03:30:22.120
to illustrate the natural monopoly

03:30:22.130 --> 03:30:24.400
by a number of examples.

03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:27.230
Here is the simplest example.

03:30:29.300 --> 03:30:36.740
In our homes in the kitchen two pipes,

03:30:37.280 --> 03:30:39.980
one with hot water, the other with cold water.

03:30:42.660 --> 03:30:46.300
Water to our homes is supplied by one company,

03:30:46.310 --> 03:30:49.180
the water channel bridge.

03:30:50.340 --> 03:30:52.440
But monopoly is bad, most

03:30:53.580 --> 03:30:54.740
often.

03:30:55.620 --> 03:30:57.780
And, well, when monopoly is usually

03:30:57.790 --> 03:31:00.900
overpriced, it is usually

03:31:02.260 --> 03:31:03.020
low quality.

03:31:03.580 --> 03:31:05.020
Why then, if the monopoly is bad,

03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:08.460
why do we then, in pursuit of competition,

03:31:08.470 --> 03:31:12.300
do not carry on every kitchen

03:31:12.310 --> 03:31:15.160
a lot of hot and cold water

03:31:15.170 --> 03:31:16.280
pipes, belonging to

03:31:16.320 --> 03:31:18.460
different companies?

03:31:18.580 --> 03:31:19.680
Companies could compete

03:31:19.690 --> 03:31:21.140
with each other.

03:31:21.660 --> 03:31:24.940
And we could choose the water

03:31:25.100 --> 03:31:28.160
that is cheaper or, say, cleaner.

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:32.620
It is not done for a very simple reason.

03:31:32.980 --> 03:31:37.140
The cost of each liter of water will increase.

03:31:37.380 --> 03:31:39.120
Here is a very conditional example.

03:31:42.820 --> 03:31:47.460
Suppose the consumption of water

03:31:47.470 --> 03:31:49.280
per unit of time, no matter, a year,

03:31:49.460 --> 03:31:51.480
a month, a day, is conditionally

03:31:51.490 --> 03:31:53.300
100 liters.

03:31:58.440 --> 03:32:00.540
To bring a pipeline with water into the

03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:03.460
apartment, you need to spend 100 rubles.

03:32:09.130 --> 03:32:12.170
The cost of one liter of

03:32:12.180 --> 03:32:16.930
water is one ruble.

03:32:20.970 --> 03:32:23.290
Now imagine that in pursuit of competition

03:32:23.300 --> 03:32:27.330
we have spent at least two pipes

03:32:27.340 --> 03:32:30.770
in the apartment, supplying water,

03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:33.150
which is delivered by

03:32:33.160 --> 03:32:35.570
different companies.

03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:38.370
Two different companies supply water to

03:32:38.380 --> 03:32:38.790
our homes.

03:32:39.070 --> 03:32:43.210
But then, if two pipes, the cost of

03:32:43.220 --> 03:32:47.250
the padding will increase exactly twice

03:32:47.260 --> 03:32:50.950
and now make up 200 rubles in total.

03:32:57.080 --> 03:32:59.800
And the consumption of water in the

03:32:59.810 --> 03:33:01.600
apartment will remain, it will not change

03:33:01.610 --> 03:33:03.940
from this, will remain as -still 100 liters.

03:33:04.600 --> 03:33:05.780
And what will happen?

03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:19.530
The cost of each liter is 2 rubles.

03:33:19.540 --> 03:33:23.610
So, this means that it is not profitable

03:33:23.620 --> 03:33:27.850
to create several companies competing

03:33:27.860 --> 03:33:29.690
with each other instead

03:33:29.700 --> 03:33:31.070
of one monopoly.

03:33:31.870 --> 03:33:36.450
The unit cost of products will increase.

03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:39.050
This is a natural monopoly.

03:33:39.470 --> 03:33:42.090
I repeat, a natural monopoly is

03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:46.590
a firm whose monopoly position

03:33:46.600 --> 03:33:47.590
is based on cost

03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:52.060
advantages and is associated

03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:55.040
with increasing scale returns.

03:33:55.060 --> 03:33:56.860
If we create several companies

03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:59.940
instead of one, the cost

03:33:59.950 --> 03:34:02.640
per unit of the product

03:34:02.650 --> 03:34:04.780
will increase.

03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:06.180
How did we get it?

03:34:06.220 --> 03:34:09.080
In my conditional example.

03:34:09.340 --> 03:34:10.060
Another example.

03:34:10.940 --> 03:34:12.240
RAU of Russia.

03:34:14.080 --> 03:34:16.320
This company is doing a lot

03:34:16.330 --> 03:34:17.100
now.

03:34:17.140 --> 03:34:18.900
It is engaged in both

03:34:20.980 --> 03:34:23.110
power generation and

03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:25.050
transmission through

03:34:25.060 --> 03:34:27.710
power lines and through

03:34:27.720 --> 03:34:30.270
its subsidiaries.

03:34:35.820 --> 03:34:40.040
Well, look, let's say, it's all power

03:34:40.050 --> 03:34:43.000
plants that generate companies.

03:34:47.180 --> 03:34:49.220
This is the electric transmission line.

03:34:56.220 --> 03:35:00.410
It is the sale of electricity to consumers.

03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:05.610
Which of these three

03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:09.430
areas of activity is a

03:35:09.440 --> 03:35:10.950
natural monopoly?

03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:19.810
Clear electric transmission line.

03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:24.900
The reform of the RAO of the

03:35:24.910 --> 03:35:26.960
EU envisages its elimination in its

03:35:26.970 --> 03:35:27.560
present form.

03:35:28.680 --> 03:35:31.520
From the RAO of the EU will

03:35:31.530 --> 03:35:33.540
be separated as independent firms

03:35:33.550 --> 03:35:36.080
wholesale generating companies

03:35:36.090 --> 03:35:39.040
and territorial generating companies.

03:35:39.420 --> 03:35:43.900
Generation can be in the field of competition.

03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:46.220
Generating companies can

03:35:46.230 --> 03:35:48.260
compete with each other.

03:35:48.480 --> 03:35:50.180
There is no natural monopoly.

03:35:51.320 --> 03:35:53.780
The electricity transmission line should

03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:54.500
be one.

03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:58.180
Because if we put another line

03:35:58.190 --> 03:36:04.860
next to that line for competition.

03:36:05.060 --> 03:36:07.500
The cost of the installation will increase

03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:08.960
exactly twice.

03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:11.760
The cost of each kilowatt hour of

03:36:11.770 --> 03:36:13.640
electricity transmission

03:36:13.650 --> 03:36:15.980
will increase.

03:36:16.260 --> 03:36:18.700
The electricity transmission line

03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:20.000
is a natural monopoly.

03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:24.280
And after the reform of the RAU

03:36:24.290 --> 03:36:26.820
EU, the power transmission line will

03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:29.860
remain owned by the federal network company.

03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:32.300
This would be a natural monopoly

03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:34.240
in which the control of the stock

03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:35.460
is owned by the state.

03:36:37.260 --> 03:36:38.080
well well well.

03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:46.030
And if we take the sphere of Gazprom,

03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:49.930
what is there a natural monopoly?

03:36:53.720 --> 03:36:55.440
Gas pipelines obviously.

03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:59.150
Independent companies

03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:00.690
can produce gas.

03:37:00.790 --> 03:37:06.140
But here is the pipe, until it is of course

03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:09.160
not filled to the end, it is better

03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.980
if there is only one.

03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:13.540
Otherwise, the cost of gas transmission will increase.

03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:16.660
Every unit of gas, I mean, will grow.

03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:20.680
In the RAO and RZD field,

03:37:20.690 --> 03:37:21.880
the Russian railways are

03:37:21.890 --> 03:37:23.440
a natural monopoly.

03:37:24.680 --> 03:37:26.800
The roads and all

03:37:26.810 --> 03:37:28.360
the railway infrastructure.

03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:32.410
Vans and locomotives are

03:37:32.420 --> 03:37:34.210
private property.

03:37:34.220 --> 03:37:35.370
It is owned by independent

03:37:35.380 --> 03:37:37.090
competing companies.

03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:40.270
They are not natural monopolies.

03:37:40.970 --> 03:37:42.050
This is actually going on.

03:37:42.450 --> 03:37:45.250
Sooner or later, only roads and infrastructure

03:37:45.260 --> 03:37:49.250
will remain in the property of RAO and the Railway.

03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:50.830
The rest will be owned

03:37:50.840 --> 03:37:52.690
by independent firms that

03:37:52.850 --> 03:37:54.790
will compete with each other.

03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:59.310
So, we have looked at the different

03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:02.990
types of existing market structures.

03:38:04.740 --> 03:38:07.700
Now, we go to the second issue of this topic.

03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:09.260
income of the company.

03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:14.220
First of all, the concept of gross

03:38:14.230 --> 03:38:17.500
income or revenue of the company.

03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:22.200
It is marked by the letters TR Total Revenue.

03:38:22.400 --> 03:38:24.260
gross income or income.

03:38:24.940 --> 03:38:25.900
What is it?

03:38:26.540 --> 03:38:27.500
It is very simple.

03:38:28.020 --> 03:38:31.260
The revenue of the company is the product of the

03:38:31.270 --> 03:38:34.880
price of the goods on the volume of production.

03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:37.680
On the slide you can see the formula.

03:38:37.740 --> 03:38:41.300
TR is equal to P multiplied by Q.

03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:44.040
The usual formula of revenue.

03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:47.360
Another term used is the average

03:38:47.370 --> 03:38:49.320
income of the company.

03:38:50.660 --> 03:38:52.200
The average income of the company.

03:38:52.210 --> 03:38:53.500
Look at the slide.

03:38:53.880 --> 03:38:58.080
This is a private revenue division on the

03:38:58.090 --> 03:39:00.340
volume of release or implementation.

03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:07.620
But it is not difficult to understand that

03:39:07.630 --> 03:39:12.200
if the revenue on the volume of release will get the price.

03:39:12.780 --> 03:39:16.840
So average income is just another

03:39:16.850 --> 03:39:18.720
name for price.

03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:28.080
Graphically, it is possible to build

03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:33.510
a revenue function if we deal with

03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:36.150
a completely competitive company.

03:39:37.350 --> 03:39:39.270
What is different, remember?

03:39:41.410 --> 03:39:45.040
A completely competitive company

03:39:45.050 --> 03:39:47.600
has a price set.

03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:51.360
The company cannot change the price.

03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:55.880
And hence it follows that the function

03:39:55.890 --> 03:39:58.660
of revenue from the release of a completely

03:39:58.670 --> 03:40:01.640
competitive firm is a linear function

03:40:01.650 --> 03:40:05.100
that comes from the beginning of the coordinate.

03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:09.000
With zero release, the revenue is zero.

03:40:09.010 --> 03:40:14.420
In the single issue, we get the issue

03:40:14.430 --> 03:40:17.440
multiplied by the given price and

03:40:17.450 --> 03:40:18.540
so on.

03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:21.280
The function of revenue will

03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:23.060
be linear.

03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:29.970
The next very important concept in

03:40:29.980 --> 03:40:34.590
microeconomics is the limit income.

03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:37.090
Margin of Revenge.

03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:40.110
The definition of the limit income is

03:40:40.120 --> 03:40:42.270
read on the slide.

03:40:42.890 --> 03:40:45.690
The company's limit income is

03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:50.370
the increase in revenue when sales

03:40:50.380 --> 03:40:53.390
increase by one unit.

03:40:55.780 --> 03:41:00.460
That is, MR is equal to Delta

03:41:00.470 --> 03:41:02.440
TR divided by Delta Cube.

03:41:07.540 --> 03:41:09.700
Does nothing remind you of

03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:10.860
the limit income?

03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:15.780
Something of what we studied, looked

03:41:16.580 --> 03:41:19.820
at in the previous topic.

03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:21.700
Remember, in the previous topic we

03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:24.280
talked about the limit costs?

03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:27.350
Let us remember.

03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:31.450
Limit costs are the increase in total

03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:34.230
costs, with the increase in production

03:41:34.240 --> 03:41:36.750
by one unit.

03:41:37.290 --> 03:41:40.830
A marginal income is the increase in

03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:43.810
revenue, with an increase in output

03:41:43.820 --> 03:41:47.070
or sales by one unit.

03:41:47.370 --> 03:41:51.350
Accordingly, the limit income is the

03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:54.870
additional income that the company

03:41:55.270 --> 03:41:59.310
receives when it releases and sells

03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:02.690
an additional unit of the product.

03:42:02.850 --> 03:42:05.790
Here is the simplest example

03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:09.810
of calculating the limit income.

03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:11.390
Look at the slide.

03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:15.310
Yes, just another small comment.

03:42:15.610 --> 03:42:19.050
If we are talking about a completely competitive

03:42:19.060 --> 03:42:23.170
company, then its marginal income

03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:26.990
is equal to the price of the goods.

03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:30.520
Well, in fact, a completely

03:42:30.530 --> 03:42:33.860
competitive company sells any volume

03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:36.400
of its products at the

03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:39.720
current market price.

03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:41.900
The price for a completely competitive

03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:44.380
company is set.

03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:51.080
And if so, then each additional

03:42:51.090 --> 03:42:53.960
unit of release brings such

03:42:53.970 --> 03:42:56.700
a company an additional

03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:59.800
revenue, the additional

03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:02.600
income is equal to this

03:43:02.610 --> 03:43:04.540
price.

03:43:05.380 --> 03:43:08.440
Well, if a company, for example, sells products

03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:11.000
all the time at the price of 10 rubles,

03:43:11.010 --> 03:43:14.560
then each additional unit of release

03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:17.520
will increase the company's revenue

03:43:17.530 --> 03:43:20.180
by those same 10 rubles.

03:43:21.280 --> 03:43:22.780
The marginal income of a firm, a

03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:24.400
firm that is completely

03:43:24.410 --> 03:43:26.580
competitive, is necessarily

03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:29.200
equal to the price of the goods

03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:30.840
at which it sells its products.

03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:34.180
Well, and look, please, at the table,

03:43:34.190 --> 03:43:36.600
on the slide.

03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:39.980
In the first column, the company's issue

03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:41.620
changes.

03:43:41.820 --> 03:43:45.220
I change it from zero to five.

03:43:46.100 --> 03:43:48.280
The price, as we have said, for

03:43:48.290 --> 03:43:50.320
a completely competitive company,

03:43:50.500 --> 03:43:52.000
is constant.

03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:53.820
10 rubles is.

03:43:54.520 --> 03:43:58.780
By multiplying the price by the volume of sales,

03:43:58.790 --> 03:44:02.430
I get the company's revenue.

03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:05.810
It changes with the change of the release.

03:44:06.090 --> 03:44:08.970
You see it changes linearly.

03:44:08.980 --> 03:44:11.610
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

03:44:11.930 --> 03:44:13.670
What we just talked about.

03:44:16.300 --> 03:44:18.660
What is the limit income?

03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:20.120
Let us count.

03:44:20.380 --> 03:44:21.880
What is the Limit Income?

03:44:22.880 --> 03:44:25.180
This is the revenue delta, that is,

03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:28.160
the increase in revenue divided by the

03:44:28.170 --> 03:44:29.660
increase in release.

03:44:30.300 --> 03:44:32.880
The increase in output here is always

03:44:34.970 --> 03:44:37.600
one, and the increase in revenue

03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:40.140
is always ten.

03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:43.260
That is, the marginal income is equal,

03:44:43.270 --> 03:44:45.720
I repeat, to the price of a product

03:44:45.730 --> 03:44:48.260
for a completely competitive firm, I repeat.

03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:50.300
For monopoly, this will no longer be the

03:44:50.310 --> 03:44:52.040
case, we will talk about it again.

03:44:53.360 --> 03:44:55.500
We move to the third question.

03:44:57.670 --> 03:45:01.350
The balance of a completely competitive company.

03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:06.300
Here we proceed from the fact that

03:45:06.310 --> 03:45:09.820
the company seeks to maximize

03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:10.800
its profit.

03:45:12.700 --> 03:45:13.920
What is Profit?

03:45:13.930 --> 03:45:15.600
It is very simple.

03:45:16.060 --> 03:45:17.620
Look at the slide.

03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:20.340
Profit is the difference between

03:45:20.350 --> 03:45:25.060
the company's revenue and its total costs.

03:45:25.240 --> 03:45:30.160
That is, the profit is equal to TR

03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:33.600
revenue minus TS total costs.

03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:37.240
And again, the company wants this

03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:40.600
difference, that is, to maximize profit.

03:45:43.170 --> 03:45:46.750
Theoretically, the problem is solved very simply.

03:45:47.610 --> 03:45:51.250
The profit of the company is maximum

03:45:51.260 --> 03:45:55.430
at such volume of production, when

03:45:55.440 --> 03:45:59.890
its limit income becomes equal to

03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:01.530
the limit costs.

03:46:04.540 --> 03:46:06.040
How to explain?

03:46:06.740 --> 03:46:07.680
See also.

03:46:08.420 --> 03:46:12.560
My company is engaged in the production

03:46:12.570 --> 03:46:15.780
of a product or service.

03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:22.340
Let's say I'm increasing the issue

03:46:22.350 --> 03:46:23.760
by one more.

03:46:25.890 --> 03:46:30.290
I will receive an additional income

03:46:30.300 --> 03:46:33.050
or in our terms a limit income.

03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:34.490
It is good.

03:46:35.250 --> 03:46:39.630
But at the same time I will have to

03:46:39.640 --> 03:46:41.190
bear additional costs.

03:46:41.200 --> 03:46:41.890
It is bad.

03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:45.650
However, if the additional

03:46:45.660 --> 03:46:48.430
income, i.e. the marginal income,

03:46:48.440 --> 03:46:52.010
is higher than the additional costs,

03:46:52.020 --> 03:46:54.310
i.e. the marginal costs, then

03:46:54.320 --> 03:46:56.410
the additional unit

03:46:56.420 --> 03:46:59.490
of production will increase

03:46:59.500 --> 03:47:02.690
the profit of my firm.

03:47:04.820 --> 03:47:09.420
And while the marginal income exceeds the

03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:14.120
marginal costs, the increase in output

03:47:14.130 --> 03:47:18.100
leads to an increase in the profit of

03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:20.240
the total profit received by the firm

03:47:20.250 --> 03:47:21.780
from all output units.

03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:28.590
So once the marginal income was

03:47:28.600 --> 03:47:32.010
equaled with the marginal costs,

03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:35.730
the additional unit of production

03:47:35.740 --> 03:47:38.790
ceased to increase the company'

03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:40.530
s total profit.

03:47:41.610 --> 03:47:46.510
The total profit reached its maximum.

03:47:48.660 --> 03:47:50.540
Thus, the profit is far greater than

03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:53.820
that of a competing firm at the maximum,

03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:56.560
at the volume of production at which

03:47:56.820 --> 03:47:58.900
the price at which it sells its

03:47:58.910 --> 03:48:02.740
products is equal, becomes equal

03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:05.020
to its limit costs.

03:48:05.460 --> 03:48:07.560
Let us make it more clear,

03:48:07.570 --> 03:48:10.600
let us look at a conditional

03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:11.960
numerical example.

03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:15.750
Here, please, look at the table

03:48:16.390 --> 03:48:19.990
in the first column of the change of the

03:48:20.330 --> 03:48:23.610
release from zero to ten.

03:48:25.060 --> 03:48:28.200
The second column is constant costs.

03:48:28.280 --> 03:48:30.220
Well, the fixed costs they do not

03:48:30.230 --> 03:48:32.800
change by definition, they do not depend

03:48:32.810 --> 03:48:34.680
on the release.

03:48:34.820 --> 03:48:37.180
You see, all the time 60, no matter what

03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:38.100
the volume of release.

03:48:38.820 --> 03:48:41.180
The third column variable

03:48:41.190 --> 03:48:44.460
costs shows how variable costs

03:48:44.470 --> 03:48:46.800
change along with the change

03:48:46.810 --> 03:48:47.860
in output.

03:48:50.020 --> 03:48:53.920
These amounts are given initially.

03:48:54.240 --> 03:48:56.860
All other values, at least

03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:58.360
in terms of costs, are

03:48:58.860 --> 03:49:00.160
calculable.

03:49:01.340 --> 03:49:04.000
Knowing the fixed and variable

03:49:04.010 --> 03:49:06.100
costs, we can calculate

03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:07.560
the total costs.

03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:11.020
We can calculate the average

03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:13.400
constant costs, the average

03:49:13.410 --> 03:49:16.060
variable costs and the average

03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:18.180
total costs.

03:49:18.380 --> 03:49:19.720
I hope you remember the formula.

03:49:21.340 --> 03:49:25.520
Finally, in the next column,

03:49:25.530 --> 03:49:29.480
we have the limit costs.

03:49:29.640 --> 03:49:30.820
How do we get them?

03:49:30.840 --> 03:49:33.420
The cost, look again.

03:49:34.060 --> 03:49:37.620
Limit costs are the increase in

03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:41.160
total costs, with the increase

03:49:41.170 --> 03:49:44.480
of production by one unit.

03:49:44.940 --> 03:49:47.360
My number is growing by

03:49:47.370 --> 03:49:48.080
one.

03:49:48.620 --> 03:49:50.980
I divide the increase in total

03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:54.800
cost per unit by the increase in production.

03:49:55.060 --> 03:49:58.400
So, when moving from zero

03:49:58.410 --> 03:50:01.420
to zero, the total cost

03:50:01.430 --> 03:50:06.040
increases by 32 rubles.

03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:09.060
This is the limit costs.

03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:11.960
These additional costs will have to

03:50:11.970 --> 03:50:14.460
be borne if we want to increase

03:50:14.470 --> 03:50:17.780
the output from zero to one.

03:50:19.900 --> 03:50:22.540
Furthermore, the output was increased

03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:25.680
by one from one to two.

03:50:26.580 --> 03:50:29.160
How much does the total cost increase?

03:50:30.890 --> 03:50:32.230
of 20 units.

03:50:32.650 --> 03:50:35.230
This is the limit costs when moving

03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:37.210
from issue one to issue two

03:50:37.220 --> 03:50:39.250
and so on.

03:50:40.250 --> 03:50:42.910
Note that the limit costs

03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:49.420
first decrease, then reach

03:50:49.430 --> 03:50:53.940
the minimum, when the four

03:50:53.950 --> 03:50:56.460
limit costs become

03:50:58.020 --> 03:51:01.450
minimum, and then the limit

03:51:01.460 --> 03:51:05.030
costs start to increase.

03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:07.270
That is, we are dealing

03:51:07.280 --> 03:51:10.790
with the classic U-shaped curve

03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:11.890
of the limit cost.

03:51:12.490 --> 03:51:13.770
That we have already mentioned in

03:51:13.780 --> 03:51:15.800
the previous shadow.

03:51:16.120 --> 03:51:20.480
The next column is the price.

03:51:22.320 --> 03:51:24.480
But if a firm is completely competitive,

03:51:24.490 --> 03:51:26.720
then, as I have said many times, the

03:51:26.730 --> 03:51:29.960
limit income of such a firm is

03:51:29.970 --> 03:51:33.300
always equal to the price of

03:51:33.310 --> 03:51:34.940
the goods at which it sells

03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:35.840
its products.

03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:40.760
So the price I set, the conditional price

03:51:40.770 --> 03:51:43.480
of 30, the limit income of a completely

03:51:43.490 --> 03:51:45.360
competitive firm is constant

03:51:45.370 --> 03:51:47.000
and equal to the price.

03:51:49.460 --> 03:51:51.680
Now look closely at the table.

03:51:55.470 --> 03:52:01.130
We increase output all the time and

03:52:01.140 --> 03:52:05.370
here, starting with two output

03:52:05.380 --> 03:52:09.370
units, the limit income or price

03:52:09.380 --> 03:52:12.150
exceeds the limit costs.

03:52:12.270 --> 03:52:14.990
For example, in issue 3, the limit

03:52:15.610 --> 03:52:17.590
income is equal to what?

03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:26.220
The maximum cost is 12.

03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:28.500
What does that mean?

03:52:31.490 --> 03:52:33.750
That if we release a third

03:52:33.760 --> 03:52:38.790
unit of products, our profit will increase.

03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:42.850
In fact, look at the last column.

03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:47.180
Profit in this zone is

03:52:47.190 --> 03:52:51.650
still negative, but with increased

03:52:51.660 --> 03:52:54.750
output, negative profit begins

03:52:54.760 --> 03:52:56.970
to decrease.

03:52:59.840 --> 03:53:01.300
That is, the profit is increasing.

03:53:06.940 --> 03:53:12.740
And look, here at issue 5 we already

03:53:12.750 --> 03:53:17.040
get a positive profit.

03:53:17.050 --> 03:53:17.940
It is equal to 8.

03:53:19.860 --> 03:53:22.040
However, we will not stop

03:53:22.050 --> 03:53:23.460
at this edition.

03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.770
Why is?

03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:28.490
Because if we produce a sixth unit

03:53:28.500 --> 03:53:30.970
of the product, what is the

03:53:30.980 --> 03:53:32.110
limit income?

03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:33.070
30 is

03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:34.110
It is always 30.

03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:37.730
The maximum cost is 18.

03:53:40.390 --> 03:53:42.430
That is, the sixth unit of products

03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:45.130
will require 18 rubles of additional

03:53:45.140 --> 03:53:47.730
costs, but will bring 30 rubles

03:53:47.740 --> 03:53:50.310
of additional income.

03:53:55.470 --> 03:53:56.550
Meaning is.

03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:58.750
How much will the profit increase?

03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:01.130
for 12 rubles.

03:54:01.890 --> 03:54:04.430
In fact, when the release 5 profit

03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:07.010
was 8, and when the release 6 it is already

03:54:07.020 --> 03:54:09.130
equal to 20.

03:54:10.310 --> 03:54:13.810
The profit increased by 12 rubles.

03:54:14.970 --> 03:54:16.310
Let us see further.

03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:19.870
In the 7th edition, what do we see?

03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:24.920
Limit income 30, limit expenses

03:54:24.930 --> 03:54:26.140
24.

03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:29.200
So, an additional unit of release

03:54:29.210 --> 03:54:32.140
increases our profit by 6

03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.880
rubles.

03:54:33.340 --> 03:54:34.260
So it happened.

03:54:35.500 --> 03:54:37.520
The profit increased by 6 rubles and

03:54:37.530 --> 03:54:39.080
reached 26 rubles.

03:54:39.860 --> 03:54:42.940
When is the profit maximum?

03:54:43.420 --> 03:54:46.520
It becomes maximum, strictly

03:54:46.780 --> 03:54:51.160
speaking, at the time when the limit

03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:56.220
income is equal to the limit costs.

03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:00.380
See, when you issue 8 the

03:55:00.390 --> 03:55:04.600
limit income 30, the limit expenses

03:55:04.610 --> 03:55:05.880
also 30.

03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.580
They were compared to each other.

03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:11.460
This means that the profit

03:55:11.470 --> 03:55:14.160
has stopped increasing.

03:55:14.860 --> 03:55:19.220
If the marginal income of the 8th

03:55:19.230 --> 03:55:21.960
edition were at least a penny

03:55:21.970 --> 03:55:25.680
more than the marginal cost, this

03:55:25.690 --> 03:55:28.080
additional unit of output would

03:55:28.090 --> 03:55:29.880
increase our profit.

03:55:30.100 --> 03:55:32.100
So, just as soon as the

03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:33.720
marginal income equaled the

03:55:33.730 --> 03:55:35.580
marginal costs, the profit reached

03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:37.160
its maximum.

03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:39.820
But here is the ninth unit of products,

03:55:40.180 --> 03:55:42.740
note, to release is pointless.

03:55:42.900 --> 03:55:43.280
Why is?

03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:46.620
What is the limit income of the

03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:47.960
ninth unit of product?

03:55:49.160 --> 03:55:50.120
Thirty as usual.

03:55:50.720 --> 03:55:52.860
What limit costs will it require?

03:55:53.120 --> 03:55:54.000
and 40.

03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:57.780
So the ninth unit of the product

03:55:57.790 --> 03:56:01.160
will reduce our total profit by

03:56:01.170 --> 03:56:01.780
ten rubles.

03:56:01.940 --> 03:56:02.700
So it happened.

03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:05.680
The total profit at nine units

03:56:05.690 --> 03:56:09.820
of release is only sixteen.

03:56:10.020 --> 03:56:13.220
The maximum point is passed.

03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:17.760
In the case of the release, eight companies

03:56:17.770 --> 03:56:20.360
are in a state of balance.

03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:23.660
It is not beneficial to reduce

03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:26.240
or increase its output.

03:56:28.370 --> 03:56:30.570
Now we'll look at the same thing,

03:56:30.580 --> 03:56:33.630
but on the schedule.

03:56:35.490 --> 03:56:38.050
Look carefully, do not rush

03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:41.250
to what is shown here on this chart.

03:56:42.770 --> 03:56:46.410
Well, all these charts could be obtained

03:56:46.420 --> 03:56:51.350
if we started to transfer the numbers

03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:53.670
from the previous table

03:56:53.680 --> 03:56:56.090
to the chart.

03:56:57.850 --> 03:57:01.250
In fact, yes you see the price line,

03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:05.130
it goes horizontally parallel

03:57:05.140 --> 03:57:09.850
to the X axis, the release axis.

03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:13.730
The price is set.

03:57:15.700 --> 03:57:18.020
It does not change with the

03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:20.120
change of the release.

03:57:21.400 --> 03:57:23.740
The price changes, and the price is constant.

03:57:24.220 --> 03:57:25.880
And the limit income, as we have said,

03:57:25.890 --> 03:57:27.700
is equal to the price.

03:57:28.120 --> 03:57:31.480
In my example, the price was 30 rubles.

03:57:32.600 --> 03:57:34.400
And she does not change.

03:57:35.020 --> 03:57:35.940
not change.

03:57:38.720 --> 03:57:41.140
Look at the limit cost

03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:42.080
function.

03:57:42.780 --> 03:57:44.240
What are the limit costs?

03:57:45.180 --> 03:57:49.780
First they decrease, then they begin to grow.

03:57:51.940 --> 03:57:54.180
This is reflected in the drawing.

03:57:54.400 --> 03:57:56.000
Do you see the cost limit function?

03:57:56.600 --> 03:57:59.540
First it decreases, then at some volume

03:57:59.550 --> 03:58:01.880
of release reaches a minimum,

03:58:01.890 --> 03:58:04.180
then the MC function

03:58:04.190 --> 03:58:05.860
begins to increase.

03:58:05.960 --> 03:58:06.340
See you?

03:58:08.500 --> 03:58:12.640
Now look at the AC function.

03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:14.820
What is AC?

03:58:16.080 --> 03:58:20.280
This is a function of average total costs.

03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:22.640
What is she?

03:58:22.680 --> 03:58:24.720
Back to the table.

03:58:25.300 --> 03:58:26.820
Look at this function.

03:58:27.100 --> 03:58:28.160
That is so.

03:58:28.720 --> 03:58:31.240
It first with the increase of

03:58:31.250 --> 03:58:33.700
the output, the average total cost

03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:40.100
of AC decreases, then with the release

03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:43.700
7 as you see reach the minimum

03:58:43.710 --> 03:58:46.620
and then the average total cost

03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:49.460
starts to increase as actually reflected

03:58:49.470 --> 03:58:52.260
in our figure.

03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:59.310
In this picture, there are

03:58:59.320 --> 03:59:02.210
several critical points.

03:59:04.320 --> 03:59:10.400
The first point corresponds to Q1.

03:59:13.300 --> 03:59:17.110
Please see what we observe

03:59:17.120 --> 03:59:20.490
in the release interval from 0 to

03:59:20.500 --> 03:59:22.830
Q1.

03:59:25.300 --> 03:59:29.160
In this interval, the limit costs

03:59:29.170 --> 03:59:32.080
look closely above the price

03:59:32.090 --> 03:59:38.550
of the product or the limit

03:59:38.560 --> 03:59:41.250
income of the company.

03:59:41.260 --> 03:59:44.930
In this period, the company'

03:59:44.940 --> 03:59:48.010
s losses only increase.

03:59:48.450 --> 03:59:49.530
So it is.

03:59:53.080 --> 03:59:53.760
See you?

03:59:54.820 --> 04:00:01.140
In the range from 0 to 1, the limit costs

04:00:01.150 --> 04:00:04.820
are greater than the limit income.

04:00:04.830 --> 04:00:08.980
Accordingly, when issuing 1 loss

04:00:08.990 --> 04:00:13.420
of the company a negative profit.

04:00:13.620 --> 04:00:15.340
The biggest ones.

04:00:15.350 --> 04:00:19.940
Look further at the painting.

04:00:20.120 --> 04:00:23.420
What do we see in the release interval

04:00:23.430 --> 04:00:27.200
from Q1 to Q2?

04:00:27.920 --> 04:00:31.340
In this interval, the limit income is already

04:00:31.350 --> 04:00:33.560
greater than the limit costs.

04:00:34.260 --> 04:00:37.360
This means that each

04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:41.800
additional unit of release already

04:00:41.810 --> 04:00:45.280
increases our profit.

04:00:45.660 --> 04:00:47.880
But the total profit remains

04:00:47.890 --> 04:00:51.340
negative due to the load of past losses.

04:00:51.760 --> 04:00:55.500
What do we see in Q2?

04:00:56.180 --> 04:01:00.700
In this Q2 issue, the price of the

04:01:02.100 --> 04:01:06.440
goods becomes equal to the

04:01:06.450 --> 04:01:08.700
average total cost.

04:01:08.940 --> 04:01:10.240
See this?

04:01:10.420 --> 04:01:15.040
In Q2, the price is equal to the

04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:16.960
average total cost.

04:01:17.360 --> 04:01:20.800
The price is equal to the average cost.

04:01:21.360 --> 04:01:23.980
The average and total costs

04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:27.520
are the costs per 1 issue.

04:01:29.680 --> 04:01:32.320
If the price is equal to the cost

04:01:32.330 --> 04:01:35.660
of 1 issue, the profit becomes

04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:37.060
zero.

04:01:39.180 --> 04:01:45.140
Therefore, the Q2 release corresponds to the

04:01:45.150 --> 04:01:48.140
point of non-loss of the company.

04:01:48.300 --> 04:01:52.780
When issued 2, the profit of the company is zero.

04:01:54.920 --> 04:01:57.740
When issued from zero to Q2, the company

04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:59.600
is losing.

04:01:59.840 --> 04:02:02.680
It is in the loss zone.

04:02:03.480 --> 04:02:07.440
And only when it reaches the Q2 release the company

04:02:07.450 --> 04:02:10.480
brings the ends to the ends for the first time.

04:02:11.520 --> 04:02:13.980
It reaches the point of unprecedentedness.

04:02:14.300 --> 04:02:17.260
If we are less, we are doomed to loss.

04:02:17.880 --> 04:02:20.900
If we reached Q2 release, the company

04:02:20.910 --> 04:02:22.520
has reached this release.

04:02:24.030 --> 04:02:26.150
Loss is zero, but profit

04:02:26.160 --> 04:02:26.750
is zero.

04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:29.790
We are at the point of unfailingness.

04:02:30.270 --> 04:02:34.550
What further increase in the output

04:02:36.200 --> 04:02:37.500
leads to?

04:02:38.100 --> 04:02:41.740
That the price is already above

04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:43.720
the average total cost.

04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:50.540
That is, with each unit of product

04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:53.440
we get more money than the

04:02:53.450 --> 04:02:55.760
cost per unit of product.

04:02:56.040 --> 04:03:00.280
So we are in a profit zone.

04:03:03.380 --> 04:03:08.000
And look, the price always

04:03:08.010 --> 04:03:11.680
exceeds the limit costs.

04:03:11.840 --> 04:03:16.500
So the more we produce,

04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:20.600
the more our profits.

04:03:25.440 --> 04:03:27.380
The more our profits.

04:03:30.540 --> 04:03:34.340
Where is the maximum profit?

04:03:36.900 --> 04:03:38.500
It is maximum, as I said, at

04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:43.800
the point where the company'

04:03:47.350 --> 04:03:50.600
s limit costs become

04:03:50.610 --> 04:03:53.280
equal to the price.

04:03:55.200 --> 04:03:57.800
In the Q3 release.

04:04:00.060 --> 04:04:03.340
In Q3, the company receives

04:04:03.350 --> 04:04:06.640
the maximum total profit.

04:04:08.230 --> 04:04:08.950
well well.

04:04:09.890 --> 04:04:12.970
And if we are going to increase

04:04:15.420 --> 04:04:20.110
output, beyond Q3, what do we

04:04:20.120 --> 04:04:21.530
get, what do we see?

04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:26.830
The limit costs are already higher than

04:04:26.840 --> 04:04:28.470
the price.

04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:33.730
This means that the maximum profit

04:04:33.740 --> 04:04:34.910
is passed.

04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:40.760
Maximum profit is reached.

04:04:41.140 --> 04:04:44.900
Profit has already begun to decrease.

04:04:45.140 --> 04:04:46.980
The balance point of the completely

04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:49.380
competitive Q3 company.

04:04:49.960 --> 04:04:54.500
With this issue, the company receives

04:04:54.510 --> 04:04:55.820
maximum profit.

04:04:56.500 --> 04:04:58.760
If the company still increases the output,

04:04:58.770 --> 04:05:05.860
in the interval from Q3 to Q4 the

04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:08.320
profit is still positive, but the

04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:09.620
maximum is passed.

04:05:10.480 --> 04:05:15.760
And when the Q4 is released, what do we see?

04:05:16.880 --> 04:05:21.840
The price of the goods again becomes equal

04:05:21.850 --> 04:05:24.280
to the average cost, or the cost per

04:05:24.290 --> 04:05:25.260
unit of the product.

04:05:25.860 --> 04:05:27.720
But if the price is equal to the

04:05:27.730 --> 04:05:30.080
cost per unit of product, the total

04:05:30.090 --> 04:05:32.740
profit becomes zero.

04:05:34.420 --> 04:05:37.740
This is the second point of unfailingness.

04:05:38.060 --> 04:05:39.460
But if we continue to persevere,

04:05:39.470 --> 04:05:41.020
continue to build output,

04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:43.840
we will already have

04:05:43.850 --> 04:05:46.180
a negative profit.

04:05:46.360 --> 04:05:51.140
We will fall into the zone of loss again.

04:05:57.260 --> 04:06:02.620
Let us complicate the situation a little.

04:06:04.400 --> 04:06:07.020
Imagine what terrible happened.

04:06:09.600 --> 04:06:11.960
I have said that a completely

04:06:11.970 --> 04:06:15.500
competitive company has no

04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:18.280
control over the price.

04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:23.770
Despite the company's will, the market price

04:06:23.780 --> 04:06:25.090
has fallen.

04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:28.070
And now it is...

04:06:28.080 --> 04:06:31.750
Look at the new slide.

04:06:33.210 --> 04:06:38.570
The market price is 24 rubles.

04:06:43.280 --> 04:06:45.640
All other data regarding

04:06:45.650 --> 04:06:48.040
costs remain the same.

04:06:51.220 --> 04:06:53.340
What does this mean now?

04:06:54.080 --> 04:06:57.660
Look closely at the

04:06:59.780 --> 04:07:03.750
last column, the last column.

04:07:05.330 --> 04:07:08.850
At such a low price, the company

04:07:08.860 --> 04:07:12.270
is doomed to losses at any volume

04:07:12.280 --> 04:07:13.410
of production.

04:07:15.130 --> 04:07:18.550
Whatever the issue, the company

04:07:18.560 --> 04:07:19.930
will be losing.

04:07:20.850 --> 04:07:24.110
What can the company do in such conditions?

04:07:26.520 --> 04:07:32.080
It can only minimize the loss.

04:07:32.680 --> 04:07:35.280
Maximum profit in this case means

04:07:35.290 --> 04:07:38.740
the minimum of the loss received,

04:07:40.780 --> 04:07:43.650
but the rule remains the same.

04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:47.970
When is maximum profit achieved?

04:07:48.910 --> 04:07:51.690
When the limit income is equal

04:07:51.700 --> 04:07:53.310
to the limit cost.

04:07:53.610 --> 04:08:00.390
See 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 See

04:08:00.400 --> 04:08:04.410
the eighth and ninth columns.

04:08:04.470 --> 04:08:07.450
In the eighth column, we have the

04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:10.190
limit costs, in the ninth column,

04:08:10.200 --> 04:08:11.870
we have the limit income equal to

04:08:11.880 --> 04:08:13.030
the price.

04:08:13.430 --> 04:08:16.810
Where are the limit costs equal

04:08:16.820 --> 04:08:18.750
to the limit income?

04:08:18.760 --> 04:08:21.510
7 in the issue now.

04:08:22.870 --> 04:08:24.390
And look at it, please.

04:08:24.850 --> 04:08:30.430
This will maximize the profit of the company.

04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:33.290
In other words, the loss is minimal.

04:08:33.930 --> 04:08:36.550
Repeat maximum profit in this

04:08:36.560 --> 04:08:39.290
case means receiving the

04:08:39.300 --> 04:08:41.330
minimum loss.

04:08:41.490 --> 04:08:43.790
The loss is minimal at release 7.

04:08:46.850 --> 04:08:51.450
But here comes the main question.

04:08:52.330 --> 04:08:53.010
See you?

04:08:53.110 --> 04:08:55.630
The company cannot avoid losses.

04:08:56.010 --> 04:08:57.450
At such a low price.

04:08:57.730 --> 04:09:01.310
It can only minimize the loss.

04:09:02.770 --> 04:09:05.030
But maybe it's worth just stopping?

04:09:05.410 --> 04:09:06.770
Stop production and all.

04:09:09.100 --> 04:09:11.780
We cannot avoid losses.

04:09:14.900 --> 04:09:16.160
Let us close.

04:09:16.880 --> 04:09:18.500
Stop the release of products.

04:09:18.940 --> 04:09:20.620
If the product is damaged, we

04:09:21.320 --> 04:09:22.920
will stop production.

04:09:23.560 --> 04:09:24.220
and all.

04:09:25.980 --> 04:09:29.540
In fact, it would be a bad decision.

04:09:32.980 --> 04:09:33.400
Why is?

04:09:34.540 --> 04:09:37.620
Let us consider the cost theory.

04:09:43.920 --> 04:09:48.800
In the short term, there are constant

04:09:48.810 --> 04:09:52.520
costs that cannot be avoided.

04:09:55.620 --> 04:09:59.740
Even if the company closes, that is,

04:09:59.750 --> 04:10:02.260
the output will be zero.

04:10:02.540 --> 04:10:05.800
There are constant costs that

04:10:06.100 --> 04:10:08.380
will still have to be borne.

04:10:09.320 --> 04:10:11.220
What are the constant costs?

04:10:14.150 --> 04:10:15.890
They are equal, see the second

04:10:15.900 --> 04:10:18.150
column, 60.

04:10:20.810 --> 04:10:24.050
If the company closes, it will

04:10:24.060 --> 04:10:25.310
lose revenue.

04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:26.750
She produces nothing,

04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:27.590
sells nothing.

04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:29.270
The revenue will be zero.

04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:31.950
It will save on variable

04:10:31.960 --> 04:10:33.170
costs.

04:10:33.350 --> 04:10:35.150
With zero output, the variable

04:10:35.160 --> 04:10:36.750
costs, as you can see, are also zero.

04:10:37.490 --> 04:10:39.810
But the constant costs will still have

04:10:39.820 --> 04:10:40.690
to be borne.

04:10:45.460 --> 04:10:48.520
This means that the company's losses will

04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:49.420
be greater.

04:10:50.440 --> 04:10:54.300
And if we close, the company's loss will

04:10:54.310 --> 04:10:56.700
be equal to the constant costs.

04:10:57.000 --> 04:11:01.160
This is reflected in the last column.

04:11:02.240 --> 04:11:04.840
In case of zero-issue, the profit of the company

04:11:04.850 --> 04:11:05.800
is minus 60.

04:11:06.600 --> 04:11:08.760
That is, the company is losing

04:11:08.770 --> 04:11:12.080
60 rubles, and this loss is exactly

04:11:12.090 --> 04:11:14.980
equal to constant costs.

04:11:19.190 --> 04:11:23.510
Well, if it is all not very

04:11:23.520 --> 04:11:26.370
clear, I will try to give this

04:11:26.380 --> 04:11:28.090
practical example.

04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:34.670
Well, you probably know that

04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:38.170
our country is now bathing in oil dollars.

04:11:40.740 --> 04:11:44.280
The price of our oil brand "Jurls"

04:11:44.290 --> 04:11:47.640
is above $ 60 per barrel.

04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:51.840
It is hard to believe now, but in the

04:11:51.850 --> 04:11:55.920
98th year, the average annual

04:11:55.930 --> 04:11:59.780
price of our oil, the world price

04:11:59.790 --> 04:12:02.200
was about $11 per barrel.

04:12:04.080 --> 04:12:08.220
At such a low price, many of our oil

04:12:08.230 --> 04:12:11.480
companies suffered losses.

04:12:12.440 --> 04:12:16.060
But they did not close.

04:12:18.960 --> 04:12:19.500
Why is?

04:12:21.020 --> 04:12:24.860
Because in the short term

04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:28.240
there are constant costs

04:12:28.540 --> 04:12:31.660
that cannot be avoided.

04:12:32.620 --> 04:12:34.640
And if the companies closed our oil

04:12:34.650 --> 04:12:36.480
companies, they would be moving to pump oil.

04:12:37.400 --> 04:12:38.960
They would lose revenue,

04:12:39.260 --> 04:12:41.400
save on variable costs.

04:12:41.620 --> 04:12:44.840
But in the oil tank there is a large

04:12:44.850 --> 04:12:47.500
amount of constant costs that

04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:49.200
must be borne regardless

04:12:49.210 --> 04:12:51.100
of whether you produce something

04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:52.420
or nothing.

04:12:52.720 --> 04:12:55.100
In this case, the losses would be

04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:56.040
even greater.

04:12:56.860 --> 04:12:59.560
This is reflected in my conditional

04:12:59.570 --> 04:13:02.000
number example.

04:13:05.760 --> 04:13:08.880
I tried to show the same thing

04:13:08.890 --> 04:13:11.480
in the painting.

04:13:11.500 --> 04:13:14.260
Look at the next slide.

04:13:14.980 --> 04:13:18.220
What is the optimal edition?

04:13:18.660 --> 04:13:20.380
Let us go back to the

04:13:20.390 --> 04:13:22.940
previous slide.

04:13:23.340 --> 04:13:26.660
The optimal output is 7.

04:13:27.300 --> 04:13:30.960
At issue 7, the company's loss

04:13:30.970 --> 04:13:32.320
is minimal, that is, the

04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:34.380
profit is as much as possible.

04:13:35.560 --> 04:13:38.160
What is the revenue with this volume

04:13:38.170 --> 04:13:39.140
of release?

04:13:40.640 --> 04:13:42.020
168 is

04:13:43.320 --> 04:13:46.720
What are the total costs of this

04:13:46.730 --> 04:13:48.380
volume of release at issue

04:13:48.390 --> 04:13:49.180
7?

04:13:49.920 --> 04:13:50.900
See also.

04:13:50.900 --> 04:13:56.250
Column TC, total cost, total cost.

04:13:56.290 --> 04:13:57.650
184 is

04:13:58.530 --> 04:14:00.270
So what do we observe?

04:14:03.760 --> 04:14:06.000
That we have the total cost,

04:14:06.010 --> 04:14:08.420
I said, exceed the revenue, we

04:14:08.430 --> 04:14:09.820
are losing.

04:14:13.150 --> 04:14:16.110
What are the variable costs of the 7th

04:14:16.120 --> 04:14:16.930
edition?

04:14:17.350 --> 04:14:19.030
124. the

04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:20.830
What are we watching?

04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:24.810
The revenue does not cover

04:14:24.820 --> 04:14:26.130
the total cost.

04:14:26.140 --> 04:14:26.590
This is yes.

04:14:26.600 --> 04:14:29.970
It covers variable costs

04:14:29.980 --> 04:14:32.970
and partly covers fixed costs.

04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:35.390
Look at the painting.

04:14:37.150 --> 04:14:38.850
In the best case, what is

04:14:38.860 --> 04:14:39.610
our income?

04:14:42.040 --> 04:14:43.500
168 is

04:14:45.140 --> 04:14:47.480
Total costs are 184.

04:14:47.900 --> 04:14:50.260
Variable costs of 124.

04:14:50.540 --> 04:14:51.820
The permanent 60.

04:14:52.100 --> 04:14:53.040
They are always 60.

04:14:55.150 --> 04:14:57.430
Here we see that revenue

04:14:57.440 --> 04:15:00.790
covers variable costs and partially

04:15:00.800 --> 04:15:02.850
covers fixed costs.

04:15:05.810 --> 04:15:07.330
If we stopped the production,

04:15:08.190 --> 04:15:09.750
we would lose revenue, save

04:15:09.760 --> 04:15:12.390
on variables, and suffer even more

04:15:12.400 --> 04:15:16.250
losses in the amount of all

04:15:16.260 --> 04:15:17.490
the constant costs.

04:15:22.540 --> 04:15:28.660
When will the company leave the market,

04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:30.500
even in a short period of time?

04:15:33.490 --> 04:15:34.170
Here is when.

04:15:34.610 --> 04:15:37.090
Look at the next slide.

04:15:37.570 --> 04:15:41.810
When the price falls to such

04:15:41.820 --> 04:15:45.770
a low level that revenue with optimal

04:15:45.780 --> 04:15:48.770
output will not even cover

04:15:48.780 --> 04:15:50.090
the variable costs.

04:15:52.420 --> 04:15:55.100
There is no point in staying

04:15:55.110 --> 04:15:57.040
on the market and continuing production

04:15:57.050 --> 04:15:58.240
in a short period of time.

04:15:58.940 --> 04:16:00.140
I have to stop publishing.

04:16:00.980 --> 04:16:03.400
We will lose revenue, but we will

04:16:03.410 --> 04:16:05.360
save on variable costs and the

04:16:05.370 --> 04:16:07.500
loss will be still less than

04:16:07.510 --> 04:16:08.700
if we stay on the market.

04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:14.210
Now I try to depict it all,

04:16:14.220 --> 04:16:18.910
to show it all in the graphs.

04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:24.590
See also.

04:16:26.620 --> 04:16:28.880
The cost functions are traditional.

04:16:30.980 --> 04:16:32.440
As it was, it is all left.

04:16:32.680 --> 04:16:33.900
There is nothing new here.

04:16:45.150 --> 04:16:51.510
The price is equal to P1 at the beginning.

04:16:52.810 --> 04:16:54.710
Which issue does the company choose?

04:16:56.390 --> 04:16:57.290
Q1 is

04:16:58.650 --> 04:17:00.110
Why Q1?

04:17:00.450 --> 04:17:03.050
Because we remember the rules.

04:17:03.610 --> 04:17:06.710
Profit is maximum at such volume

04:17:06.720 --> 04:17:09.810
of production, at which the price

04:17:09.820 --> 04:17:12.990
or limit income is equal to

04:17:13.000 --> 04:17:15.050
the limit costs.

04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:17.710
The price is equal to the limit costs.

04:17:21.570 --> 04:17:23.710
Imagine that regardless of the will

04:17:23.720 --> 04:17:26.550
of the firm, a completely competitive

04:17:26.560 --> 04:17:27.870
firm does not affect the price,

04:17:27.880 --> 04:17:29.670
as we said, the price drops

04:17:29.950 --> 04:17:33.890
to the level of P2.

04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:42.530
Where is the issue where the

04:17:42.540 --> 04:17:43.670
profit is maximum?

04:17:46.000 --> 04:17:49.580
It is profit maximum always with such

04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:52.500
volume of production, where the price

04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:54.640
is equal to the limit costs.

04:17:54.720 --> 04:17:56.720
Where is this crossroads?

04:17:57.040 --> 04:18:01.560
The point is now E2 and Q2 release.

04:18:06.480 --> 04:18:11.580
But with this issue, the company

04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:14.700
no longer receives any economic profit.

04:18:20.320 --> 04:18:24.140
At this price and this issue, with this

04:18:24.150 --> 04:18:25.820
issue, it is better to say so, with

04:18:25.960 --> 04:18:29.900
Q2, the price is equal not only

04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:32.360
to the marginal costs, but also

04:18:32.370 --> 04:18:33.860
to the average total costs.

04:18:33.880 --> 04:18:34.920
Look carefully.

04:18:37.940 --> 04:18:39.840
Do you see the average total cost line?

04:18:41.400 --> 04:18:42.820
The AC line.

04:18:44.040 --> 04:18:46.220
The AC function decreases, then

04:18:46.230 --> 04:18:48.480
reaches the minimum to the E2 slurry.

04:18:52.560 --> 04:18:56.980
At the P2 price, the company does not

04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.840
get any profit.

04:18:58.060 --> 04:19:00.220
And no losses.

04:19:00.230 --> 04:19:02.160
The economic profit is zero.

04:19:03.920 --> 04:19:06.260
And if the price drops to P2, to

04:19:06.340 --> 04:19:08.960
P3, what are we now watching?

04:19:09.100 --> 04:19:13.280
For any volume of production, the price is below

04:19:13.290 --> 04:19:14.400
the average cost.

04:19:14.620 --> 04:19:16.440
Cost per unit of product.

04:19:16.640 --> 04:19:18.260
Losses are inevitable.

04:19:18.270 --> 04:19:20.160
But nevertheless, to minimize

04:19:20.170 --> 04:19:23.060
the loss, the company chooses

04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:26.840
the release always one where the

04:19:26.850 --> 04:19:30.220
P3 price is equal to the limit cost.

04:19:30.320 --> 04:19:32.120
This is Q3 release.

04:19:35.250 --> 04:19:37.970
The company is losing.

04:19:40.920 --> 04:19:43.680
It minimizes the loss at this point.

04:19:48.280 --> 04:19:50.920
But note what is important, when

04:19:54.070 --> 04:20:00.770
the price at the Q3 release

04:20:00.780 --> 04:20:03.570
price exceeds, look carefully,

04:20:04.390 --> 04:20:07.010
the average variable cost.

04:20:08.660 --> 04:20:10.160
Look carefully.

04:20:10.220 --> 04:20:14.960
When Q3 is released, we always

04:20:14.970 --> 04:20:18.400
have P3 price, and the AVC

04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:21.240
function is lower.

04:20:21.780 --> 04:20:25.040
This means that while remaining on

04:20:25.050 --> 04:20:29.660
the market, the firm partially covers

04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:31.980
variable costs and partially

04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:33.200
covers fixed costs.

04:20:33.520 --> 04:20:35.200
So it's better to stay on the market.

04:20:35.380 --> 04:20:36.840
What I just told you.

04:20:36.960 --> 04:20:37.460
and above.

04:20:38.840 --> 04:20:42.420
If the price drops below P4,

04:20:42.580 --> 04:20:44.480
see what happens.

04:20:46.440 --> 04:20:50.640
If the price drops below P4, what

04:20:51.540 --> 04:20:53.140
will the price be?

04:20:53.960 --> 04:20:57.260
The minimum of the average variable cost.

04:20:57.820 --> 04:21:00.040
In this case, the company should close

04:21:00.050 --> 04:21:02.120
in a short period of time.

04:21:02.400 --> 04:21:05.700
The revenue will not only cover

04:21:05.710 --> 04:21:07.680
fixed, but also variable costs.

04:21:09.620 --> 04:21:11.080
Further production

04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:14.560
will only lead to losses.

04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:22.810
The E4 point is called the escape

04:21:22.820 --> 04:21:25.010
point in microeconomics.

04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:29.130
Point E4 is the minimum point of

04:21:29.140 --> 04:21:30.750
the average variable cost.

04:21:34.440 --> 04:21:38.220
If the price drops below, the revenue will

04:21:38.230 --> 04:21:39.640
not cover the variable costs.

04:21:40.680 --> 04:21:42.000
Must be closed.

04:21:43.140 --> 04:21:45.900
But I repeat, this is the theory of

04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:47.660
the company's balance all – yet in a

04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:48.720
short period of time.

04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:53.690
Once again, if the price is, for

04:21:53.700 --> 04:21:57.990
example, P3, the company will

04:21:58.000 --> 04:21:59.350
be losing.

04:21:59.650 --> 04:22:01.270
But in a short time, it will remain

04:22:01.280 --> 04:22:02.110
on the market.

04:22:02.290 --> 04:22:04.130
Otherwise, the losses will be even greater,

04:22:04.410 --> 04:22:06.930
because there are constant costs that

04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:09.730
cannot be avoided in a short

04:22:09.740 --> 04:22:11.910
period of time.

04:22:15.520 --> 04:22:17.720
What is the difference between a long period

04:22:17.730 --> 04:22:18.800
and a short period?

04:22:21.310 --> 04:22:25.150
In the long run, all costs

04:22:25.160 --> 04:22:26.490
can be revised.

04:22:27.970 --> 04:22:30.790
For example, in the short term,

04:22:30.800 --> 04:22:32.690
the lease contract cannot be

04:22:32.700 --> 04:22:33.130
revised.

04:22:33.410 --> 04:22:36.010
Rental is a constant cost.

04:22:37.370 --> 04:22:39.050
The rent is covered by contract.

04:22:39.090 --> 04:22:40.350
The rent cannot be avoided.

04:22:41.170 --> 04:22:42.730
What can we do in the long run?

04:22:44.250 --> 04:22:45.850
To give up this lease,

04:22:45.860 --> 04:22:48.010
re-conclude, change the

04:22:48.020 --> 04:22:49.870
lease contract, find some

04:22:49.880 --> 04:22:52.250
other room, try to

04:22:52.260 --> 04:22:55.590
optimize costs.

04:22:55.890 --> 04:22:59.050
Therefore, in the long term, the company

04:22:59.060 --> 04:23:02.930
receiving a loss from the market will, of

04:23:02.940 --> 04:23:05.670
course, come out.

04:23:06.090 --> 04:23:10.510
If not, change the cost.

04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:12.070
For example, a more profitable rental

04:23:12.080 --> 04:23:12.930
contract.

04:23:15.260 --> 04:23:19.340
Now to the fourth question.

04:23:21.450 --> 04:23:23.610
We have talked with you about the

04:23:23.620 --> 04:23:26.890
balance of a completely competitive company.

04:23:27.490 --> 04:23:31.540
Now let's talk about how the

04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:35.440
balance of a company with

04:23:35.760 --> 04:23:38.400
monopoly power is achieved.

04:23:41.220 --> 04:23:43.240
I remind you.

04:23:43.800 --> 04:23:46.540
A company with a monopoly power

04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:50.720
can control the price within certain

04:23:50.730 --> 04:23:51.940
limits.

04:23:54.960 --> 04:23:57.740
It can set a higher price.

04:23:58.420 --> 04:23:59.860
But then it will face a fall in

04:23:59.870 --> 04:24:01.020
demand for its products.

04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:03.340
It can set the price lower, the demand

04:24:03.720 --> 04:24:05.440
for its products will increase.

04:24:06.240 --> 04:24:10.320
So what is the task of a monopoly?

04:24:10.330 --> 04:24:16.860
The monopoly is a price maker, a price-seeker.

04:24:17.480 --> 04:24:21.620
Its task is to set such a price, respectively,

04:24:21.860 --> 04:24:23.020
to choose such a volume of

04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:26.180
release, in which its profit

04:24:26.190 --> 04:24:29.300
will be maximum.

04:24:32.720 --> 04:24:35.900
The general rule of profit maximization.

04:24:36.740 --> 04:24:40.140
Profit is maximum when the limit

04:24:40.150 --> 04:24:43.340
income is equal to the limit

04:24:43.350 --> 04:24:46.180
cost, this rule is universal.

04:24:46.980 --> 04:24:49.820
It is true for any firm, even if it is completely

04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:51.740
competitive, even if it is a monopoly,

04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:53.740
even if it is an origopolis, even if

04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:54.600
it is anyone.

04:24:55.160 --> 04:24:59.200
The profit of any company is maximum

04:24:59.210 --> 04:25:04.520
when its limit income is equal

04:25:04.530 --> 04:25:07.020
to the limit costs at this volume

04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:08.200
of production.

04:25:10.970 --> 04:25:12.590
Here, the monopoly brings nothing

04:25:12.600 --> 04:25:14.310
new compared to a completely

04:25:14.320 --> 04:25:15.310
competitive firm.

04:25:17.140 --> 04:25:19.820
But there is an important difference.

04:25:20.300 --> 04:25:22.400
Remember, I said that in a completely

04:25:22.410 --> 04:25:25.100
competitive firm the limit income

04:25:25.110 --> 04:25:28.620
is equal to the price of the commodity.

04:25:30.160 --> 04:25:32.460
The monopoly has nothing like that.

04:25:34.240 --> 04:25:37.820
The monopolist's marginal income

04:25:39.920 --> 04:25:44.380
is always less than the price at which

04:25:44.390 --> 04:25:47.320
the monopolist sells his products.

04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:50.790
This is what needs to be solved.

04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:56.090
Let us take the simplest conditional

04:25:56.100 --> 04:26:00.150
function of demand for the monopoly product.

04:26:15.460 --> 04:26:18.540
P is 10 minus Q.

04:26:19.800 --> 04:26:23.980
P is the price, Q is the demand.

04:26:24.180 --> 04:26:26.000
What are we watching?

04:26:26.380 --> 04:26:29.300
The higher the price, the lower

04:26:29.310 --> 04:26:32.180
the demand.

04:26:33.940 --> 04:26:38.800
Here is this function, the data taken from

04:26:38.810 --> 04:26:42.240
this function I transferred to the table.

04:26:42.250 --> 04:26:44.200
Please look at the slide.

04:26:46.920 --> 04:26:51.560
Well, see, at the price of 10, let's say,

04:26:51.700 --> 04:26:54.360
put a tenth here, the amount of demand

04:26:54.370 --> 04:26:55.540
will be what?

04:26:56.260 --> 04:26:56.560
and zero.

04:26:57.120 --> 04:26:57.800
Okay no?

04:26:58.920 --> 04:27:01.520
At the price of 9, if we place

04:27:01.530 --> 04:27:03.880
the nine, the demand will be

04:27:03.890 --> 04:27:05.060
one and so on.

04:27:05.340 --> 04:27:07.400
So, what does the first line

04:27:07.410 --> 04:27:08.760
contain?

04:27:09.520 --> 04:27:11.180
All possible prices for the monopoly

04:27:11.190 --> 04:27:12.560
product from 10 to 0.

04:27:13.460 --> 04:27:16.420
The second line contains all

04:27:16.430 --> 04:27:19.320
possible values of demand at a particular

04:27:19.330 --> 04:27:21.040
price.

04:27:21.300 --> 04:27:21.900
Of course yes?

04:27:22.840 --> 04:27:26.140
The third line contains what?

04:27:29.060 --> 04:27:32.420
Monopoly at different prices.

04:27:34.380 --> 04:27:36.260
I hope you remember that revenue is

04:27:36.270 --> 04:27:40.980
a product of the price on the volume

04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:42.700
of demand.

04:27:43.020 --> 04:27:46.340
So at the price of 0 we can not

04:27:46.350 --> 04:27:47.860
sell a single unit of the goods,

04:27:47.960 --> 04:27:49.280
respectively, the revenue is 0.

04:27:49.960 --> 04:27:51.640
At the price of 9 we can sell one unit

04:27:51.650 --> 04:27:53.920
of the goods of the monopoly.

04:27:54.280 --> 04:27:56.460
9 and so on.

04:27:57.840 --> 04:27:58.600
and so on.

04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:01.740
I would like to reiterate

04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:04.640
that monopoly cannot abolish

04:28:04.650 --> 04:28:06.860
the laws of demand.

04:28:07.040 --> 04:28:08.980
No matter what monopoly I am, at a certain

04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:11.140
price, the demand for my products

04:28:11.150 --> 04:28:12.340
will fall to zero.

04:28:16.850 --> 04:28:20.070
Well, so what are we watching?

04:28:20.490 --> 04:28:22.390
What is our revenue?

04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:26.630
First it increases, then at the price

04:28:26.640 --> 04:28:33.970
of 5 reaches a maximum of 25,

04:28:33.980 --> 04:28:36.910
and then revenue begins to decrease.

04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:43.870
Now let us calculate

04:28:43.880 --> 04:28:46.710
the monopoly income.

04:28:50.200 --> 04:28:51.620
The limit income formula is

04:28:51.630 --> 04:28:52.680
clearly known.

04:29:13.730 --> 04:29:16.270
The limit income is equal to the increase

04:29:16.280 --> 04:29:21.630
in revenue divided by the increase

04:29:21.640 --> 04:29:23.290
in output.

04:29:28.800 --> 04:29:32.640
First, we set the

04:29:32.650 --> 04:29:35.140
price 10.

04:29:37.120 --> 04:29:40.720
And no one bought anything from us.

04:29:40.980 --> 04:29:45.320
Then set the price 9 and bought

04:29:45.330 --> 04:29:47.460
one unit of products.

04:29:47.960 --> 04:29:49.720
How much has the revenue increased?

04:29:50.920 --> 04:29:53.380
From zero to nine, that is, by nine.

04:29:54.080 --> 04:29:59.500
Delta TR 9 is equal to the delta of the unit.

04:29:59.820 --> 04:30:02.860
The maximum income is 9.

04:30:06.600 --> 04:30:09.020
Only in this case would

04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:11.600
the limit income be better,

04:30:11.610 --> 04:30:13.260
more correct.

04:30:13.840 --> 04:30:17.080
Not put under the unit, not under

04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:20.440
issue 1, look at the slide, but as

04:30:20.450 --> 04:30:23.360
if when moving from issue 0 to

04:30:23.370 --> 04:30:24.340
issue 1.

04:30:25.560 --> 04:30:28.680
That is, it is the conversion of revenue

04:30:28.690 --> 04:30:32.580
when the output increases from 0 to one.

04:30:32.700 --> 04:30:34.000
Looking forward.

04:30:36.480 --> 04:30:39.220
When we get the 1st edition, what is the revenue?

04:30:39.280 --> 04:30:42.020
9 and at issue 2 is 16.

04:30:42.840 --> 04:30:45.160
So when the output increases by one

04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:47.640
unit from one to two, the revenue

04:30:47.650 --> 04:30:52.780
increases from 9 to 16, that

04:30:52.840 --> 04:30:53.920
is, by 7.

04:30:53.930 --> 04:30:56.300
Accordingly, the limit income

04:30:56.310 --> 04:30:58.360
when moving from issue 1

04:30:58.370 --> 04:31:02.360
to issue 2 is 7 and so on.

04:31:03.580 --> 04:31:06.300
So I filled out the last line,

04:31:06.310 --> 04:31:09.480
which contains data on the change

04:31:09.490 --> 04:31:11.940
in the limit income.

04:31:16.560 --> 04:31:17.300
well well.

04:31:22.570 --> 04:31:27.450
And now let's set any volume

04:31:27.460 --> 04:31:30.450
of release from those shown

04:31:30.460 --> 04:31:33.110
here on our slide.

04:31:35.410 --> 04:31:37.650
Let's say, issue 3.

04:31:42.190 --> 04:31:45.610
What price do I need to set to

04:31:45.620 --> 04:31:47.770
sell 3 units of products?

04:31:50.880 --> 04:31:52.460
Look at the first line.

04:31:52.880 --> 04:31:55.360
To sell three units of products, the

04:31:55.760 --> 04:31:58.260
monopoly must set a price of 7.

04:31:59.480 --> 04:32:04.260
What is the limit income in

04:32:05.720 --> 04:32:08.900
issue 3?

04:32:10.020 --> 04:32:12.460
Look, he will be between, look

04:32:12.470 --> 04:32:14.940
at the last line, he will be

04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:16.680
between 5 and 3.

04:32:17.660 --> 04:32:19.100
It can be rigorously proven

04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:21.660
mathematically that at issue 3 the

04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:24.000
limit income will be equal to 4.

04:32:24.840 --> 04:32:28.320
So, when the issue of 3 is the price of

04:32:28.330 --> 04:32:30.120
7, and the monopoly's limit income is only 4.

04:32:30.720 --> 04:32:33.800
The monopoly's marginal income is less than the price.

04:32:37.180 --> 04:32:39.820
Okay, I will give you another volume.

04:32:40.420 --> 04:32:42.360
Let's say there are 5.

04:32:42.600 --> 04:32:43.480
Go to 5.

04:32:43.680 --> 04:32:44.500
Let it 5.

04:32:45.640 --> 04:32:47.260
What is the price of 5?

04:32:47.400 --> 04:32:48.900
What price does a monopoly have

04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:52.040
to set to sell five units of goods?

04:32:53.160 --> 04:32:53.960
The price 5.

04:32:55.080 --> 04:32:56.540
What is the limit income in

04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:57.140
issue 5?

04:32:57.620 --> 04:32:59.000
Look at the last line.

04:32:59.280 --> 04:33:01.460
between a unit and a minus.

04:33:01.800 --> 04:33:03.740
It can be strictly proven that when

04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:05.780
issuing 5 the limit income is equal to 0.

04:33:05.790 --> 04:33:10.340
The price is above the limit income.

04:33:11.770 --> 04:33:13.430
Why am I leading all this?

04:33:14.010 --> 04:33:17.570
I am trying to explain here that in a completely

04:33:17.580 --> 04:33:20.310
competitive firm the marginal income,

04:33:24.810 --> 04:33:28.090
remember, was always equal to the

04:33:28.100 --> 04:33:30.210
price of the commodity.

04:33:30.710 --> 04:33:35.190
And the monopolist has a limit income at any

04:33:35.200 --> 04:33:40.270
volume of production less than the price

04:33:40.280 --> 04:33:41.470
of the goods.

04:33:45.930 --> 04:33:48.890
I strongly suspect that this is my explanation,

04:33:48.900 --> 04:33:54.150
it seems to be too mathematically

04:33:54.160 --> 04:33:55.930
explained, or not.

04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:57.910
It seems that yes, according to

04:33:57.920 --> 04:34:00.870
the numbers, against the numbers like you can't stop.

04:34:02.030 --> 04:34:04.570
But I would like you to understand

04:34:06.770 --> 04:34:10.420
this logically.

04:34:14.660 --> 04:34:16.880
Why does a monopolist have a marginal

04:34:18.670 --> 04:34:21.080
income always lower than the price of

04:34:21.200 --> 04:34:22.900
the goods at which he sells his products?

04:34:23.200 --> 04:34:24.340
What is the matter here?

04:34:29.050 --> 04:34:29.970
Let us give such an example.

04:34:31.010 --> 04:34:31.010
well well.

04:34:31.270 --> 04:34:32.250
I will try this way.

04:34:32.490 --> 04:34:33.610
A very conditional example.

04:34:34.710 --> 04:34:38.990
I am a monopolist of selling beer

04:34:39.000 --> 04:34:40.690
in this city.

04:34:40.870 --> 04:34:42.770
I sell beer alone.

04:34:42.780 --> 04:34:45.110
I will not let anyone else into this market.

04:34:45.450 --> 04:34:46.890
I am the only seller.

04:34:47.550 --> 04:34:51.490
I am very willing to

04:34:51.500 --> 04:34:52.830
buy beer, please.

04:34:55.170 --> 04:34:57.850
As soon as I become a monopolist, I begin to

04:34:57.860 --> 04:34:58.770
play with the price.

04:35:01.770 --> 04:35:04.090
On the first day of sale, I set the price

04:35:04.100 --> 04:35:07.410
of 10 rubles for a bottle of beer.

04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:09.110
How many beer have I bought?

04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:11.490
Look at the table.

04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:12.090
and zero.

04:35:12.850 --> 04:35:14.970
No customer has come to me at

04:35:14.980 --> 04:35:15.850
this price.

04:35:16.050 --> 04:35:17.190
The price is too high.

04:35:18.650 --> 04:35:19.190
well well.

04:35:20.430 --> 04:35:24.350
I start to lower prices, I have nowhere to go.

04:35:24.950 --> 04:35:28.050
The next day I set the price 9.

04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:30.250
How many beer have I bought?

04:35:32.880 --> 04:35:33.880
One bottle.

04:35:34.680 --> 04:35:35.800
Who came to me?

04:35:36.420 --> 04:35:39.320
Or the richest person, or

04:35:39.330 --> 04:35:41.380
the biggest beer lover in this city.

04:35:41.600 --> 04:35:43.500
At the price of 9 I sold one bottle.

04:35:45.530 --> 04:35:46.610
Let me not be pleased.

04:35:47.450 --> 04:35:50.470
The next day I set the price of 8 rubles

04:35:50.480 --> 04:35:52.690
for a bottle of beer.

04:35:55.510 --> 04:35:59.630
The one who bought 9 rubles,

04:35:59.640 --> 04:36:04.230
8 will buy, even with great pleasure.

04:36:04.650 --> 04:36:06.270
Who will come to me?

04:36:08.260 --> 04:36:10.880
There will be a second beer lover,

04:36:10.890 --> 04:36:12.200
for whom the price of 9 rubles

04:36:12.210 --> 04:36:14.300
was too high, and 8 is right.

04:36:15.920 --> 04:36:18.400
So what does it work out?

04:36:18.860 --> 04:36:21.360
At the price of 8 I have already sold two bottles.

04:36:24.660 --> 04:36:26.840
And now tell me, please, how much

04:36:29.920 --> 04:36:33.760
money the second beer lover

04:36:33.770 --> 04:36:35.940
brought me today,

04:36:35.950 --> 04:36:37.880
the extra money he didn't bring

04:36:37.890 --> 04:36:39.820
me yesterday.

04:36:43.440 --> 04:36:44.980
He brought me nothing yesterday.

04:36:46.200 --> 04:36:48.860
I bought a beer for 8 rubles.

04:36:49.720 --> 04:36:52.300
So I got an extra 8 rubles

04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:54.320
from him, which I didn't get

04:36:54.330 --> 04:36:55.460
yesterday.

04:36:59.970 --> 04:37:00.830
It is good.

04:37:01.450 --> 04:37:02.150
What is bad?

04:37:03.530 --> 04:37:05.910
I lost the ruble on the first buyer.

04:37:07.680 --> 04:37:11.020
I bought it for 9 days and now it's

04:37:11.030 --> 04:37:12.760
the same price for everyone.

04:37:13.840 --> 04:37:14.900
The price is always the same.

04:37:16.100 --> 04:37:17.340
Well, at least in my model, the price is

04:37:17.350 --> 04:37:18.860
the same for everyone.

04:37:19.880 --> 04:37:22.740
So the second buyer brought, on the

04:37:22.780 --> 04:37:24.000
second buyer I won 8 rubles, and

04:37:24.010 --> 04:37:26.860
on the first I lost a ruble.

04:37:27.300 --> 04:37:30.260
So it turned out that the increase

04:37:30.270 --> 04:37:32.800
in revenue was not the price, the price

04:37:32.810 --> 04:37:37.340
now is 8, and the marginal buyer, it

04:37:40.460 --> 04:37:41.320
is understandable why, in fact,

04:37:43.710 --> 04:37:45.140
the marginal buyer is less than

04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:46.000
the price?

04:37:46.900 --> 04:37:50.420
Because when we lower the

04:37:52.680 --> 04:37:57.780
price, we lose on those

04:37:58.160 --> 04:38:00.320
buyers who could buy the

04:38:00.330 --> 04:38:02.260
goods at a higher

04:38:02.270 --> 04:38:04.000
price.

04:38:04.360 --> 04:38:04.840
Again once again.

04:38:05.400 --> 04:38:07.160
On the second buyer I won 8 rubles,

04:38:07.170 --> 04:38:09.100
he brought me 8 rubles today,

04:38:09.110 --> 04:38:10.660
which yesterday did not bring me.

04:38:11.200 --> 04:38:13.960
But the first one brought me yesterday

04:38:14.240 --> 04:38:16.400
9 and today he brought only 8, I

04:38:16.410 --> 04:38:18.100
sell 8 rubles of beer.

04:38:18.300 --> 04:38:19.240
So I lost the first ruble,

04:38:19.250 --> 04:38:20.840
and I won the second 8.

04:38:21.340 --> 04:38:23.260
The total limit income is

04:38:23.270 --> 04:38:24.140
only 7.

04:38:25.100 --> 04:38:27.480
The price is above the limit income.

04:38:30.870 --> 04:38:34.290
And it can be strictly proved, I do not

04:38:34.300 --> 04:38:35.310
use higher mathematics, but simply

04:38:35.330 --> 04:38:36.070
standing on my fingers to explain,

04:38:36.080 --> 04:38:39.770
it can be strictly proved that if the demand

04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:44.050
function is nine, the function of the

04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:46.110
monopolist's limit income is also

04:38:46.120 --> 04:38:48.670
linear, and its inclination is twice

04:38:48.680 --> 04:38:51.310
the inclination of the demand

04:38:53.090 --> 04:38:55.700
function, the prileasing function

04:38:55.710 --> 04:38:56.760
of demand.

04:38:57.600 --> 04:39:00.820
The margin income function is also linear,

04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:03.460
written on a slide, and its slope

04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:07.320
is twice the slope of the demand curve.

04:39:07.940 --> 04:39:08.720
Here, we see that.

04:39:08.960 --> 04:39:10.420
See the demand function.

04:39:10.460 --> 04:39:13.040
Do you see the limit income function?

04:39:13.050 --> 04:39:14.980
The function of the limit income is twice

04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:17.580
as fast as the function of demand.

04:39:18.120 --> 04:39:20.940
Its inclination is twice as much.

04:39:23.070 --> 04:39:24.390
Well, and now let's see with

04:39:27.300 --> 04:39:29.730
you how you can show on the

04:39:29.740 --> 04:39:33.430
chart of achieving monopoly balance.

04:39:35.370 --> 04:39:36.490
Here what do we see?

04:39:37.230 --> 04:39:39.290
linear function of demand.

04:39:41.630 --> 04:39:44.690
On the other hand, we see the function

04:39:44.700 --> 04:39:45.610
of the limit income.

04:39:46.900 --> 04:39:48.860
The function of the limit income has, as

04:39:48.880 --> 04:39:50.580
I have said, a twice greater inclination

04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:52.920
than the function of the demand for

04:39:52.930 --> 04:39:54.620
the monopoly product.

04:39:54.900 --> 04:39:58.380
And I also put on this picture the functions,

04:39:58.390 --> 04:40:01.000
the classic functions of the marginal

04:40:01.010 --> 04:40:04.320
and average income of the monopolist.

04:40:04.420 --> 04:40:06.660
Excusions, the marginal costs

04:40:06.670 --> 04:40:09.200
of the monopoly and its average

04:40:09.210 --> 04:40:10.240
total costs.

04:40:10.620 --> 04:40:12.800
The function of the marginal,

04:40:12.810 --> 04:40:14.940
I repeat, and the average total cost

04:40:14.950 --> 04:40:16.180
of the monopoly.

04:40:19.840 --> 04:40:22.400
The rules, I said, are always one.

04:40:23.720 --> 04:40:26.220
Profit is maximum at such volume

04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:30.100
of production, where the limit

04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:36.650
income is equal to the limit costs.

04:40:37.870 --> 04:40:42.190
Look at the schedule where we

04:40:42.200 --> 04:40:44.590
cross the functions of the limit

04:40:44.600 --> 04:40:45.870
income and the limit cost.

04:40:46.210 --> 04:40:47.390
You see the crossroads?

04:40:49.810 --> 04:40:54.490
This point determines the QM issue,

04:40:55.770 --> 04:40:59.430
in which the profit of the monopoly is maximum.

04:41:03.070 --> 04:41:06.090
What price will the monopoly pay?

04:41:07.860 --> 04:41:13.220
This price should be looked for on the function on

04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:15.320
the demand curve.

04:41:15.380 --> 04:41:17.880
See, we restore the perpendicular

04:41:17.980 --> 04:41:23.100
from the QM point up to the intersection

04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:26.140
with the demand function.

04:41:26.360 --> 04:41:29.240
And from there we lower the perpendicular to the

04:41:29.250 --> 04:41:30.720
Y axis, to the price axis.

04:41:32.380 --> 04:41:37.960
So, in order to sell QM goods,

04:41:38.460 --> 04:41:40.880
the monopoly must set the PM price

04:41:40.890 --> 04:41:42.980
for its products.

04:41:45.620 --> 04:41:49.340
At this price and such volume of

04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:51.760
production and sales, the profit

04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:55.040
of the monopolist becomes maximum.

04:41:57.680 --> 04:41:59.100
And now finally, please,

04:41:59.920 --> 04:42:04.240
can you show the profit, the

04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:06.280
amount of monopoly profit

04:42:06.290 --> 04:42:07.820
on the chart?

04:42:10.090 --> 04:42:11.650
Well look at.

04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:13.770
What is profit, remember.

04:42:13.930 --> 04:42:14.650
It is easy.

04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:17.710
Profit is the difference between

04:42:17.720 --> 04:42:20.470
revenue and total costs.

04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:25.470
What is profit and revenue?

04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:34.310
This is the price multiplied by the volume of sales.

04:42:36.010 --> 04:42:39.390
So PM multiplied by QM.

04:42:39.650 --> 04:42:41.450
Graphically, this is the area

04:42:41.460 --> 04:42:48.910
of the rectangle O PM EQM.

04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:54.910
Where are the total costs?

04:42:56.850 --> 04:42:58.250
The total cost can be calculated

04:42:58.260 --> 04:43:01.490
by multiplying the average total

04:43:01.500 --> 04:43:04.410
cost again by the volume of

04:43:04.420 --> 04:43:05.650
production.

04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:09.810
If so, then the average total

04:43:09.820 --> 04:43:13.270
cost is equal to the area of the

04:43:13.280 --> 04:43:21.090
rectangle O C FQM.

04:43:22.840 --> 04:43:24.260
That is, it is the area of the

04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:28.940
lower rectangle, and how do we get the profit?

04:43:29.080 --> 04:43:30.060
From the area of the

04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:31.300
upper rectangle, we deduct the area

04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:32.640
of the lower rectangle.

04:43:32.880 --> 04:43:33.740
Accordingly, the profit of the

04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:35.760
monopoly is equal to the area

04:43:35.770 --> 04:43:40.820
of the rectangle C PM E F.

04:43:47.370 --> 04:43:49.890
And a very important conclusion that

04:43:49.900 --> 04:43:51.430
follows from all this.

04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:54.370
Let us remember the perfect competition.

04:44:00.030 --> 04:44:04.110
In perfect competition, the price

04:44:04.120 --> 04:44:06.410
at which the company sells its

04:44:08.380 --> 04:44:11.270
products becomes equal to

04:44:11.280 --> 04:44:14.470
its limit costs at the

04:44:14.480 --> 04:44:16.590
point of balance.

04:44:16.650 --> 04:44:21.150
There is the equation P equal to MC.

04:44:23.200 --> 04:44:25.660
And in the conditions of monopoly domination,

04:44:27.060 --> 04:44:29.440
the monopoly sets a price, look

04:44:31.570 --> 04:44:33.900
at the figure, above the

04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:35.160
limit costs.

04:44:36.320 --> 04:44:37.800
See you?

04:44:38.160 --> 04:44:41.740
The demand line is above the limit

04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:42.780
cost curve.

04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:48.590
The monopoly's limit costs at the QM issue

04:44:48.600 --> 04:44:51.450
are equal to the OC segment.

04:44:52.770 --> 04:44:55.190
The price of the monopolist, the price that the

04:44:55.200 --> 04:44:57.270
monopolist has set, is equal to the

04:44:57.280 --> 04:44:58.570
OPM segment.

04:45:00.210 --> 04:45:01.910
So, I repeat, the monopoly

04:45:02.090 --> 04:45:03.490
sets a price that exceeds

04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:05.530
the limit costs.

04:45:06.950 --> 04:45:10.330
And hence the most important conclusion is that

04:45:10.340 --> 04:45:18.170
monopolies are able to overpriced the price and underestimate

04:45:18.180 --> 04:45:20.130
the volume of production.

04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:23.410
In the conditions of monopoly power, the

04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:28.350
price is higher and the output is lower

04:45:28.360 --> 04:45:31.730
than in the conditions of competition.

04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:38.090
This is the main claim of society

04:45:38.100 --> 04:45:39.290
to monopoly.

04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:46.190
Monopolies overpriced the price and underestimated

04:45:46.200 --> 04:45:47.950
the volume of production compared to the

04:45:47.960 --> 04:45:49.790
volume of production that would have been

04:45:49.800 --> 04:45:51.710
made if it had had had instead of the

04:45:51.720 --> 04:45:52.790
monopoly competition.

04:45:54.880 --> 04:45:57.620
This is the main basis

04:45:57.630 --> 04:46:00.920
for antimonopoly

04:46:00.930 --> 04:46:03.000
policy.

04:46:06.400 --> 04:46:09.420
Antimonopoly policy is a policy

04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:12.300
of promoting competition.

04:46:14.680 --> 04:46:18.180
In the West, anti-monopoly policy has

04:46:18.190 --> 04:46:23.720
more than a century of experience.

04:46:24.420 --> 04:46:26.660
The first anti-monopoly law in the

04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:28.640
United States, if I am not mistaken,

04:46:28.650 --> 04:46:31.100
was passed in the 1990s of the

04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:33.520
19th century.

04:46:33.800 --> 04:46:37.540
We are in Russia 100 years later.

04:46:38.500 --> 04:46:41.100
Details about the anti-monopoly

04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:45.340
policy are stated in the text of

04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:47.540
this lecture, attached to this

04:46:47.550 --> 04:46:49.280
visual course.

04:46:49.820 --> 04:46:54.440
I will say two words literally that

04:46:54.450 --> 04:46:57.300
antimonopoly policy is a policy

04:46:57.310 --> 04:47:00.400
of promoting competition.

04:47:01.800 --> 04:47:03.520
It is for this it is directed.

04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:10.630
In Russia, a new anti-monopoly

04:47:10.640 --> 04:47:12.810
law has been adopted.

04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:16.450
In 2006, the Competition Protection

04:47:16.460 --> 04:47:17.890
Act was adopted.

04:47:18.490 --> 04:47:21.210
A very useful law contains

04:47:21.220 --> 04:47:23.150
many interesting provisions,

04:47:23.160 --> 04:47:25.630
new provisions that aim to

04:47:25.640 --> 04:47:27.330
prevent monopoly

04:47:27.340 --> 04:47:29.450
domination in the markets.

04:47:33.220 --> 04:47:36.820
But on the other hand, our policy in

04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:39.040
Russia, the policy of the Russian

04:47:39.050 --> 04:47:41.180
government, in this sense, is

04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:42.700
at least ambiguous.

04:47:43.620 --> 04:47:46.800
On the one hand, a very useful anti-

04:47:46.810 --> 04:47:49.040
monopoly law is being adopted.

04:47:50.260 --> 04:47:55.900
More and more large companies

04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:58.780
are being created under

04:47:58.790 --> 04:48:00.540
state control.

04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:05.150
The so-called national champions.

04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:11.510
On the one hand, we are fighting against monopoly.

04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:15.670
On the other hand, we are developing monopoly.

04:48:17.250 --> 04:48:20.370
Rosoboronexport is pulling in its

04:48:20.380 --> 04:48:21.330
entire orbit.

04:48:21.340 --> 04:48:23.430
All new and new enterprises

04:48:23.440 --> 04:48:28.490
form holdings under their control.

04:48:28.790 --> 04:48:31.890
The same is happening in aviation.

04:48:33.600 --> 04:48:35.360
I repeat, you will read more about this

04:48:35.370 --> 04:48:37.940
in the text of the lecture.

04:48:41.260 --> 04:48:44.380
I would only like to be careful

04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:47.780
to question the effectiveness of

04:48:47.790 --> 04:48:49.040
such a policy.

04:48:53.660 --> 04:48:57.560
Most foreign experts and domestic

04:48:57.570 --> 04:49:00.360
experts believe that the policy

04:49:00.660 --> 04:49:03.900
of state support for large

04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:09.060
companies will only lead

04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:11.580
to the fact that these companies

04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:14.640
will become ineffective.

04:49:15.220 --> 04:49:17.000
State support, lack of

04:49:17.120 --> 04:49:19.620
competition will kill business.

04:49:22.560 --> 04:49:24.620
Read more about this in the text

04:49:24.630 --> 04:49:26.040
of the lecture.
