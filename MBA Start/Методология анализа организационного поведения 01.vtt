WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. My name is Oleg Yevgenievich Boksansky.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
I am a professor at the Russian Academy of Economics in Plekhanov

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
and I teach various courses within the framework of the MBA.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
The main area of my interest is HR consulting and all the areas of work with staff.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Our meeting today will be devoted to the analysis of various existing scientific approaches

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
to studying organizational behavior.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
The problem here is that there are a huge number of methods, methods of investigation,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
and measurement procedures in science.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
It is very difficult to determine what is really useful in our activities.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
So, the question is pragmatic.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
What results can be really useful for us in solving our business tasks?

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Our meeting today will be devoted to the attempts to find the criteria

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
that will allow us to answer the question, as it interests us.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
We will start with the analysis of these processes,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
what scientific criteria exist in organizational behavior,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
how people behave in a company, in a company,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
what are their motives, what are their desires,

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
what are their stereotypes, what are their behavioral patterns,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and how these behavioral patterns can be studied, analyzed,

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
and, accordingly, used to solve the business tasks that we want.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
These are the tasks, the problems, the approaches that our particular company faces.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
After that, we will move on to the analysis of how behavioral research is designed.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
Now there are a lot of companies that offer services of sociological research,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
psychological research, collective psychological climate analysis,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
analysis of conflict situations in a collective,

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
development prospects, building a non-conflict organization, and so on.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
How to design this research so that the results are not shared,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
but are specific to our company, specific to our specifics, specific to our tasks?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
The next question we will consider is related to the collection of data

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
and the measurements that should be made in the organization.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
An organization is, first of all, living people.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
We are not robots that can conduct various types of research

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
so that we do not notice or pay attention to it.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
There are certain rules of information collection, behavior rules,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
and a certain ethical of research, which we will discuss in a moment.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The next question we will consider is the validity of the results or their justification.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
When researchers come to us, they speak their own scientific language.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
They say a lot of beautiful terms, concepts, words, draw graphs, diagrams, histograms.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
But we are not interested in the scientific framework of these results,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
but in how much these results, for which we paid,

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
will be useful in terms of the competitiveness of our company,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
in terms of the development of our company,

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
in terms of the coverage of the niche of this or that which relates to our business area.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
After we consider these elements of scientific knowledge, scientific methodology,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
we will move on to the analysis of various directions that exist in organizational behavior.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
We will focus our attention on two most promising and most successful directions

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
that have become popular recently.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
These are the cognitive and behavioral directions.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
The cognitive direction focuses on the analysis of human thinking abilities.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
What does a person think? What motivates a person?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
What is the level of his compulsion? What is the level of his achievements?

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
What criteria can we give to stimulate a person to work better

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
and, accordingly, make more contribution to the implementation of the goals that lie ahead of our company?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
This is a relatively new direction.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
The behavioral direction is traditional for business behavior, for the analysis of the organization.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
It has existed practically since the beginning of the last century.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
And the main task that lies ahead of this direction is to find certain results

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
that the organization should achieve.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
The organization is people. There are no abstract organizations.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Accordingly, how to influence people, how to manipulate them, if you want,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
there is nothing wrong with this word, in order to get the desired result,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
if we are employers.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
This is a behavioral direction.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
In literature, you can come across its name as behaviorist.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
But this is just not quite the right transliteration.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
To be more precise, this is a behavioral direction.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
This is the topic of our meeting, which we will talk about today.

05:26.000 --> 05:36.000
So, let's start by analyzing what the scientific method of research is.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Now, it is very often said that there is a scientific method of research.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
And in this regard, a lot of attention is paid to different scientific approaches,

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
scientific schools, scientific research organizations.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
And it is believed that if we apply the scientific methods that we have recommended,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
they will be useful, including in the activities of our organization.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
They will be useful for achieving the goals that lie ahead of us.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
And in order for our business results to please us.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
As for the scientific method of research, its main feature is the experimental approach.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
If we use a scientific approach, it has its own rules.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
What are these rules and why do they lead to the desired results?

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
Why is the scientific approach very successful in solving the tasks that lie ahead of us?

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
The first question that arises is the problem of formulating the question itself.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
We can formulate the question in such a way that we want our company to be in the top rankings by the results of the year.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
This is not a scientific approach, because these are common words, common directions, common desires.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
The scientific approach is always specific.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And this specificity is its positive side.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
The question should be clear.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
We want to increase the annual turnover by so many percent.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
We want to take third place in any classification that exists in business ratings, and so on.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
First of all, the task is to formulate the question that we want to study.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
If we do not formulate this question, we will not know what to measure, what to get.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
After the question is formulated, a research program is built.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
If we want to achieve certain results, without conflict behavior in the organization,

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
without mutual support, competition, competition within the team,

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
it is necessary to collect data on what is now in the team, what relations exist now.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Because there are some initial conditions.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
These are the conditions that exist in a real organization and the conditions that do not suit us.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
If they suited us, we would not invite specialists, we would not contact providers

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
in order to get some other results.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
In order to collect the necessary data, we must build and organize an observation of the processes that occur.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
And after this observation occurs, we will have certain data,

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
certain information about the current situation in our company.

08:45.000 --> 08:53.000
However, as for the scientific approach, it is not limited to such a collection of facts.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
When we collect facts, there may be various mistakes, which we will talk about later.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
And, accordingly, even if we have obtained some result, it is necessary to check it

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
or to verify the results.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
Are they accidental? Are they not associated with some unforeseen circumstances?

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
And will the same actions, the same approaches be carried out further?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
This verification is a rather complex process.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
And we will later consider how to carry it out optimally.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
After we have formulated the issue and conducted an observation,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
as well as verified the data we have obtained,

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
we can somehow reformulate the original issue that we have.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
We can reformulate it based on the data we have obtained,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
because we have reflected the specificity of the organization,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
we have reflected the circumstances in which it is located, in which it functions.

09:54.000 --> 10:05.000
And, accordingly, now we already have some idea of the reasons for the failure of the employee's work in this organization,

10:05.000 --> 10:14.000
or we have some hypotheses about how to achieve the goals that are set before the organization.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
After this initial set of data is done, we formulate the conclusions

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
that will be the result of the study.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
These conclusions are nothing more than a statement of the situation in the organization

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
and subsequent development of recommendations on how to correct the situation in the desired growth for the customer.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
This is the scientific approach.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
We act not from the point of view of intuition,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
not from the point of view that someone told us something

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
or that the same actions are more successfully implemented in some organization.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
We base ourselves on specific data, on specific results that we have,

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
and, accordingly, on these results we build a further development program.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
In principle, this is the essence of the scientific approach.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
It does not matter what it is used for, for physics or for galaxies,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
it is only for specific business processes that interest us in the organization.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
Just to analyze all the problems that we have just mentioned,

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
there is a special section in Nokia called the methodology of research.

11:29.000 --> 11:37.000
The task of the methodology is, first of all, to use certain terms

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
that will be clear to various people in describing the situation in a particular company.

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
Secondly, to choose, justify and apply different methods and methods of research in the right way,

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
and thirdly, to get the desired result.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
This is the very result we are talking about.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
In this case, the methodology pays great attention to the fact that we always,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
if we use the scientific approach, start from some specific facts.

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
After these facts have been studied, we select certain methods that have already been recommended to us,

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
which have been tested, which have been successful, which have been justified,

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
and we try to apply these methods, based on the initial scientific conditions that we received

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
when analyzing the original data, to this organization.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
We try to identify the connections between different events, between different variables,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
to understand which connections are dominant, which are significant,

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
which are secondary and random, which connections need to be strengthened, strengthened, developed,

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
which connections can be avoided, which connections should not be paid attention to.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
But when we are constantly dealing with these issues,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
we must always focus on a specific, obtained result.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
Science does not act on the principle that there is a goal,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
and then we apply certain methods and solutions until we get the result.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
In science, there is always a feedback factor.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
As we get new and new results, we compare what we have received with the desired result.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
How close are we to achieving the final goal?

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Maybe we are starting to deviate from this goal.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Where should we stop in order to conduct a research again,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
why the results we get are not what we wanted?

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Or analyze what the success of certain results is.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
This is the task of methodology.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Naturally, as you understand, we talk about this in brief,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
as much as we need it in the analysis of organizational behavior,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
which we are now discussing with you.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
Naturally, our pragmatic goal is to use only those methods,

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
approaches that are useful to us in our daily business activities.

14:16.000 --> 14:26.000
So, let's now focus our attention on how the observation of organizational behavior is built.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
There is an organization, there are people working in this organization.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
There are certain tasks that are solved in this organization.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
There is a certain schedule, there are certain duties.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
And the organization is a coordinated interaction,

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
a coordinated unity of people performing different functions, different tasks,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
but united by a common goal.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
The common goal is to achieve the commercial business results that are before the organization.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
The first question that arises in this regard is the question of what is the goal of our observation.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Why should we observe?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
What characteristics, what points, what parameters?

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
Choosing these parameters is not an easy and non-trivial task.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
Because we, as the leaders of the organization, can be sure that the whole problem is that

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
employees work poorly, are late for work, that employees do not want to work,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
want to get more, and so on.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
This is our opinion.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
This opinion is very often subjective.

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
At the same time, the situation may be that employees, for example, do not have enough time

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
to solve the tasks assigned to them.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
The problem may be due to the fact that they are overloaded,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
that there is no clear schedule and schedule of their activities.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
And in this regard, employees have their own motives, their own approaches.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
And if we conduct an observation, then, accordingly, the task is to take into account the interests

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
and interests of all parties.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
This is the advantage of a third-party organization or a provider of external services

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
that we attract from the outside.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
It is not about acting on someone's behalf.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
This organization is trying to implement a certain objective approach,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
an objective view of the problem, in order to take into account the interests of all parties

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
and give the desired result that the customer requires.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
After we have observed different criteria and different parameters,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
what these criteria are and how they are selected, we will talk about this a little later,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
a hypothesis is formed.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
The hypothesis is, perhaps, the most interesting, the most non-trivial

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
and the most creative moment of any research.

16:57.000 --> 17:05.000
In the hypothesis, we, in fact, formulate assumptions about the causes of failure,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
the causes of stagnation of the company's development

17:10.000 --> 17:18.000
and what steps, what paths are necessary to make in order to get rid of negative layers

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
and get the desired result,

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
that is, in the end, to achieve the final result that was set for the company,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
that was set for the company.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
The hypothesis is a very important value,

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
because depending on what hypothesis we formulate,

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
in the future we will be able to justify this hypothesis

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
and develop recommendations and methods of achieving certain results,

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
which, in the end, should lead to our original goal –

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
to achieve the results that were set for us,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
the results for which this research was carried out,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
the results why we spent money on conducting this research.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
When we formulate a hypothesis,

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
in this case, the need arises to identify certain variables.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
There are a huge number of factors that affect a person's behavior,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
the success of an organization, the achievement of a particular result.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
And, of course, it makes no sense to cover all these factors.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Among these factors, we need to identify the most important,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
the most significant,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
the effects of which lead to the most significant results

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
and the most significant changes.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
For this purpose, variable studies are allocated.

18:42.000 --> 18:49.000
That is, those facts, those actions, those points, those events,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
which are actually observed,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
which actually have an impact.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
And our goal is to find the most significant factors and variables

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
that will have an impact on the desired result for us

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
or will ensure the stable development of a stable functional organization.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Variables can be dependent and independent.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
This is the most significant division of variables in any experimental study.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
An independent variable is the factor that we consider to be the main factor

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
in solving all the problems that arise.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
That is, in fact, it is the heart of a particular hypothesis.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
An independent variable will be what we study.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
As an independent variable, you can choose almost any factor.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
It can be the salary level, it can be the motivation level,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
it can be both the material and non-material motivation level,

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
it can be the level of personal assessment,

19:52.000 --> 19:59.000
it can be a variety of actions aimed at career growth,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
at the functioning of the personnel reserve,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
at the assessment, training and development of personnel.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
The choice of an independent variable depends on the tasks that we want to solve

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
and on the hypotheses that we formulate.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
The choice of an independent variable is our prerogative.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
But if this variable is chosen,

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
then we are actually signing that this variable is significant

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
and that is why we will pay attention to it.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
The next step after we have chosen an independent variable

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
is the search for dependent variables.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
Different actions, different results, different consequences can depend on one variable.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
These consequences can be important, they can be secondary.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
If, for example, we increase the salary of an employee,

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
then the results that he gets should change, increase.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
This is a dependent variable in the sense that the impact on it

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
leads to significant changes in the processes that take place,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
in the results that we strive to achieve.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
In addition to the independent variable,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
such a value as a distorting variable is very important.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
Indeed, when we work with people, when we work on solving certain tasks,

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
there are factors that are directly related to the end results that we should get,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
as well as those factors that are situational, random.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
For example, today employees received a salary that pleased them,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and therefore they work with inspiration and success.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Tomorrow this will no longer be the case, the day after tomorrow even more so.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
Today, this employee received a complaint from the boss,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
he is depressed and does not want to work,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
or he does not work as usual.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
These are so-called distorting variables,

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
variables that affect the result in a random way,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
and are situational, depending on the situation.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
Usually they do not manifest, but it so happened that today it works.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
These variables must be taken into account.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
This is a very difficult issue, because when a study is conducted,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
it is conducted on a specific day, in a specific place, in specific conditions.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
And it is a very important circumstance to separate the dependent and independent variables from the distorting ones.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
What should those people who conduct this study do?

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Moreover, when they give you their study results,

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
they should mention those variables that may have had a distorting effect on the study results.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
This also applies to the hypothesis that we have already discussed.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
The fourth variable is the indirect variable.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
As for the indirect variable, it is an auxiliary variable.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
This variable, with the help of which we get additional ways of influencing the dependent variable.

23:05.000 --> 23:12.000
The variable with which we enhance or, on the contrary, block, neutralize the distorting variable.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
These are also situational variables,

23:16.000 --> 23:25.000
but the indirect variables are very often used to neutralize or get rid of the negative or positive,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
but still third-party influence of the distorting variable.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
Of course, we will not, but this is not our task, to analyze how these variables are typed,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
how they are built, what questions are asked.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
This is a task that is decided by the provider conducting the study.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
But we, as customers of the study, as users and consumers of its results,

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
should keep in mind what to pay attention to when we receive a report,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
where there are a lot of beautiful scientific words.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
In addition to variables, when we conduct a scientific study,

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
the definition of the term that is present in this definition plays a very important role.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
And as for the experimental study,

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
here we should pay attention to the operational definition.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
We do not need definitions that are in different kinds of encyclopedias.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
These are scientific definitions, they are correct, they are good,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
but these definitions are still too abstract.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
We do not know how to apply these definitions specifically to our goals.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
We are interested in the so-called operational definition,

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
the essence of which is that the process is described,

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
with which the variable is measured.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Any experiment, any observation is a measurement.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
A measurement that allows for verification,

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
a measurement that allows for the process and procedure of studying a new result.

24:59.000 --> 25:08.000
Accordingly, the operational definition is a list of methods of measuring our variable.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
After the variables are selected, determined and placed,

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
the next task arises in the study of who to observe,

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
which employees, which managers, which processes, which interactions.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
After all, if we look at the interaction of people,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
they are completely diverse during the day.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
People can talk about work, people can talk about personal problems,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
people can talk about plans, people can talk about difficulties.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And accordingly, a problem arises.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
What is significant in observation?

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
Where are those significant components, those significant approaches

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
that need to be noticed, that need to be analyzed,

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
and that contain significant information, and not secondary or insignificant.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
The definition of the structure of observation,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
the definition of the object of observation is a very important task.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
And when we get the results of the observation,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
it is written what the object of observation was,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
what the object of observation was, who was observed,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
and what characteristics of this object were observed.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
What characteristics of a person, his personal qualities,

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
his emotional qualities, his emotional sphere.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Why was the observation carried out?

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
In order to identify whether the desired results were obtained as a result of the study,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
from the point of view of solving the task that was set.

26:42.000 --> 26:50.000
The next task, which consists of the analysis of the experimental procedure,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
the observation procedure,

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
is where to conduct the observation, the place of observation.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
We can consider the office, we can consider the back office,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
we can consider the front office,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
we can consider the actions of any department,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
the sales department, the legal department,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
the administrative and economic department,

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
we can consider the department of management, accounting, and so on.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
Each part of the organization contributes its necessary contribution to the implementation of the common goals.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
Accordingly, if we conduct an observation of the organization,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
we need to take into account all these variables,

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
all these sections, structures, functional elements that exist in the organization.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Therefore, when constructing an observation,

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
when describing it, when planning it,

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
the problem of where it is carried out also has a significant importance.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
The next question that arises here,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
and what we have already talked about during the analysis of the methodology,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
how to conduct an observation.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
This is a very important question.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
Indeed, imagine that there is a team where people have known each other for a long time,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
in which they work,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and suddenly someone comes,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
who says that this is the investigator,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
who will, accordingly, observe your work

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
in order to then give recommendations on how you work.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
And you understand what the attitude to this person will be.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
People will stop working,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
they will sit and think how to behave,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
what this person will write,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and what will it lead to.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
That is why the situation of such an external observation is practically hopeless.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
We will never see what we want to see.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
We will see the desired reaction,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
we will see some kind of artifact, artificial behavior,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
but from the beginning unnatural behavior of people.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Therefore, when various types of observations are carried out,

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
the method of their conduct arises.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
The methodology of observation.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
The most common method is called the included observation.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
A new person is admitted to your unit,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
and it is said that from today a new employee is working for us.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
And accordingly, we do not consider him as a certain eye,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
a certain eye, a certain eye that looks at us

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
in order to then tell about our shortcomings, our difficulties.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
We have certain relationships,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
they can be positive, they can be negative,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
but nevertheless, these are working relations.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
And this person who is carrying out this observation

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
is an included observer.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
He is included in the team,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
and accordingly, being included in this team,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
he sees all the real relationships that exist,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
all the real advantages, disadvantages, difficulties,

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
problems that arise here.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
This is the most optimal type of observation.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Only one difficulty arises here.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
After all, the person we include in the team

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
must be a specialist in the work of the team.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
If, for example, we put a psychologist in the accounting department,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
well, I think here you immediately understand

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
that it will become very clear very quickly

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
that the person is incompetent.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
And immediately there is a suspicion about what he is doing here.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Therefore, the problem of included observation,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the most optimal observation,

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
is far from simple and perhaps one of the most difficult.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Again, when we conduct an observation,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
we need to know why to observe,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
what we have already talked about.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
That is, you need to have an observation program.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
This observation program, of course,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
is made up of all kinds of observations,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
and then it is already agreed upon

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
and approved by the customer of the observation.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
Is it really necessary to look at those or other criteria?

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Or we missed something, we did not take something into account.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
The problem is that if we order an observation,

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
then we put the conditions that are implemented in this observation.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
And, accordingly, we need to have a general understanding

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
and general idea of the variables that are implemented,

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
of the operational definitions that will be presented in this study,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
about where the analysis is carried out, how it is carried out.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
The next question that arises in this regard

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
is the reliability of the results obtained.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Because in this case we face two situations.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
The first is the so-called field observation.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
This is just the most complex type of observation,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
which we have already talked about.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
We observe people in natural conditions,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
during their working day,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
in their everyday relationships,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
in their everyday work,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
in their everyday life,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
with their everyday mistakes,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
with their everyday achievements.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Moreover, we observe, being in this team.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
People do not do something on purpose

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
in order to achieve some result.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
People just work.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
And we can briefly look at the real working conditions that arise here.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
This is the best type of observation,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
the best type of experimentation,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
because from a pragmatic point of view,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
it is exactly what we are interested in.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
We really see what is happening.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But, unfortunately, it is not always so easy.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
If, for example, we have a large organization

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
with 300,000-500,000 employees,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
then you understand perfectly well

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
that it is quite difficult to observe all of them.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
In principle, for us to focus our attention

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
and be able to observe people,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
it is no more than 5, 7, 9 people.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
But if we have 500 people in the organization,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
then, accordingly, we need 100 observers.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Naturally, this is an unjustified result.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Therefore, from observing in the field conditions

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
we move on to observing in laboratory conditions

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
or laboratory experiments.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
The situation is that, for example,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
the leadership of the organization,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
the head of the department,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
indicates to us the most key employees,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
who, from their point of view,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
make the most significant contribution to the work of this unit

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and achieve the result.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
And then we ask them to help us

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
to get the desired results.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
We can conduct surveys with them.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
We can conduct observations with them

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
of their daily work.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Moreover, they will know that we are observers.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
This is a laboratory experiment.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
It is naturally different from observing in the field conditions

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
because these are artificial conditions.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Naturally, as we have already said,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
if I know what is watching me,

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
I will try to behave as it should be

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and to present myself in the best possible light.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
I will not behave as I do every day.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
But we often do not have other ways

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
to get the necessary information.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
After all, the goal of any research is to get the desired result

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
in a rather short period of time.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
That is, to satisfy the requests of the customer

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
to fulfill the tasks that were set for us.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
From this point of view,

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
laboratory observation is the simplest,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
the fastest, and the most convenient way

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
to get the desired results.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
But it is also the most passionate.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Because a person, again, I would like to draw your attention to,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
will strive to do what he should do

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and to present himself in the best possible light,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
not how he really does it,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
how he really scolds his subordinates,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
what expressions he uses,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
what he pays attention to.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
This is how observation is planned,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
how a scientific experiment is built,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
and what should and can be paid attention to

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
in the results of this experiment.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Let's move on to the next question,

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
which is related to the processing of the results of the experiment.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
Look, we have considered four types of variables.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
We talked about the fact that hypotheses are assumptions

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
that we build.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
We talked about the pros and cons of observation,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
about the importance of observation,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
about the importance of observation.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Of course, we are talking about a lot of random factors,

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
which we would like to get rid of,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
because random factors are what arises unexpectedly,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
and we still want to build

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
some organized behavior structure,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
some stable, standard behavior structure,

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
which is not necessarily a result of the experiment.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
And we want to build a certain structure of behavior,

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
some stable, standard structure,

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
which will allow us to consistently,

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
intentionally, constantly get the desired results.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
In order to solve this problem,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
there is, in science, perhaps, the only method

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
that is suitable for this,

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
it is the method of statistics, of statistical measurements.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
How do the results show up?

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
The results are practically mathematical.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
If we have a large number of random events,

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
then these events are subject to certain laws.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
They are subject to the so-called normal distribution curve,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
which you can see on this slide.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
No matter what random events occur,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
no matter what the results are,

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
they will still be subject to this curve.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
This curve is characterized by the fact

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
that all the results,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
no matter what the random results are,

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
they all fit into a certain level of statistical significance,

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
which you see on this slide.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
And, accordingly, we can always be sure

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
that these results are the result of the experiment,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
which is always with a corresponding degree of probability,

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
up to 99.72%, as you can see on the slide.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
We can be sure that these results will be reliably reliable.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
However, it should be borne in mind

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
that in this case we are talking about correlational dependencies.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
There are two types of dependencies, as we have already said,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
correlational and causation-related.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
The causation-related dependency suggests

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
that a particular event necessarily leads to the corresponding consequence.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
But usually this never happens in real life.

37:41.000 --> 37:46.000
Therefore, in real life we have to work with different types of correlations.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
A correlation is a statement that

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
if a particular event occurs,

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
then a particular consequence will most likely occur.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
There is a certain connection between two events.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
But this is not a definite connection.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
The event may, in turn, occur, or may not occur.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
We can find $100 on the street by accident,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
or we can not find it.

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
The probability here is about 50 to 50.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Either we find it or we don't.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
And each of us can remember from his life

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
that different events have occurred.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
So, they occur in the life of each person.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Some are more successful, some are less successful.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
But if we take a large number of people

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
and average these events,

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
all these averages will still fall into this normal distribution curve.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
As for experimentation and scientific approach,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
it should be borne in mind that

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
scientific approach almost never looks for causation-related connections.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Scientific approaches, the hypotheses we talked about,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
the variables we looked at,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
serve to establish different kinds of correlations

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
and find the correlations that will be most often implemented,

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
which will be the most successful, and therefore the most desirable.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
In this regard, there is a need to consider

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
different kinds of variables that arise here,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
which we will do a little later.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Another very important method,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
again, a statistical method of analysis of different results,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
is meta-analysis.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
We can consider different processes using different methods.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
For example, the success of the organization's functioning.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
We can study it using sociological methods,

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
psychological methods, organizational methods.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
And the same process, for example,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
the growth of sales in the department of sales can be studied from different points of view.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
We will get different results describing the same process,

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
the same result, the technology of sales.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
When we get several quantitative results of the same process,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
we can try to summarize them

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
in order to identify some common characteristics.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
This is exactly what the meta-analysis procedure serves for,

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
as a quantitative assessment of various methods of study,

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
various procedures for measuring the same process.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Meta-analysis can be represented in different ways.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Factor analysis, correlation analysis, dispersion analysis.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
This is all described in different textbooks.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
This is what we should only know,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
but not to delve into,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
because it consists of quite interesting, refined mathematics.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
When we get the results of the study,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
we are primarily concerned with the validity of these results.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
The concept of validity and reliability of experimental results

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
is a key criterion with which we, as customers,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
should assess the results provided by the provider

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
as a result of the study.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
We have already talked about the fact that

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
if we use a scientific method for the analysis of results,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
its distinguishing feature is verification.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
Our results are checked.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
As for verification,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
validity and reliability are the main characteristics

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
of the analysis of this verification.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
Validity is the justification of the result of the experiment.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
Let's say we ordered the provider

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
to study the level of conflict in the team.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
And the provider instead provides us with a report

41:57.000 --> 42:03.000
that contains the characteristics of the motivation of the team members.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
We get completely different results

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
from the analysis we made for the customer.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
That is, this result is invalid.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
We conducted the study, got good results,

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
developed the motivation, but we were not interested in it.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
We were interested in the conflicts.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
The results were invalid.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Validity is a very important feature

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
and it reflects the analysis process from different sides.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
There is a structural validity.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
As for structural validity,

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
its essence is that the questions asked in the survey,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
the questions that are present in the tests,

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
are really aimed at the analysis of the criteria we set.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
In this example, it is the conflict, not the motivation.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
In addition to structural validity, there is also content validity.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Any survey, any test includes a large number of questions.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
There can be 10, 20, 50, 100 and more.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
Content validity reflects whether each of these questions

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
will really relate to the tasks that are before the survey.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
Or some of these questions are secondary,

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
do not concern the interest of the problem.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
And the third option of validity is the criterion validity.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
We have already said that if we study a certain behavior,

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
we must agree on the criteria for describing this behavior.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
On the variables, dependent, independent, and so on.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Criterion validity reflects that

43:51.000 --> 43:58.000
the variables selected are studied in this survey,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
in this test material.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
Here are three main types of validity.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
The first type is structural validity, the second is content validity, and the third is criterion validity.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
And again, it is these questions that we should pay attention to

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
when analyzing the results of the survey that we are given.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
But validity is only the first and very important feature

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
of the survey conducted in the verification process.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
The second feature is reliability.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
Reliability is essentially the reproducibility of the results of the survey.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
That is, how much did we manage to avoid the behavior of distorting variables in our study?

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
How successfully did we select the independent variable?

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
How well did we calculate the correlation relationships

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
that exist between the dependent and independent variables?

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
Where did the intermediate variables that exist here interfere?

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
There are different ways to check the reliability.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Again, we will not consider all these methods.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
We will consider the most important ones,

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
those pragmatic methods that are very often used in the analysis of organizational behavior.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
The simplest way to check the reliability is a repeated test.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
We conducted a test of a particular selection of people.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
And in order to make sure that the results we got are really reliable,

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
really correct, we conduct a repeated test of the same selection on the same test.

45:31.000 --> 45:38.000
Yes, there are difficulties here, because people can remember the questions,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
and it can be boring and uninteresting to answer the same questions a second time.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
But if we still want to be sure of the result that we are given,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
then we have to pay for reliability, as for everything in life.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
The next way to check the reliability is the analysis of internal compatibility.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
Again, if we consider our example with the analysis of conflict,

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
we must be sure that the questions that are in the questionnaire

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
really study the conflict on different sides.

46:15.000 --> 46:25.000
They contain both conflict, motivation, emotions, level of achievement, and level of compulsion,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
that all questions are set in a uniform rhythm.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
This is the internal compatibility of questions,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
which is closely related to the same criteria and substantive validity.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
All these criteria are naturally tied to each other, and this is the scientific approach.

46:39.000 --> 46:47.000
There are many ways to justify and verify the result that we get.

46:47.000 --> 46:56.000
There are other methods of evaluating reliability, but they are not very important.

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
Again, we get the results of the study so that we know what to ask

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
and what to pay attention to from the provider who conducts this study.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
The third very important question, in addition to the validity and reliability of the results,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
is the possibility of generalization of the results of the study,

47:15.000 --> 47:21.000
the possibility of generalization and the possibility of their distribution in the situations that have not been analyzed.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
We can consider the same conflict in accounting.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
But in addition to accounting, we have the legal department,

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
we have the sales department, we have the financial department,

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
we have the department of the registration of certain transactions.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
There are also conflicts.

47:38.000 --> 47:46.000
If a study is really conducted that answers the questions about the reasons for the conflict in this organization,

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
then the results obtained in accounting should be able to be distributed to the sales department,

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
to the administrative department and other departments.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
That is, we will not conduct the same study in other departments.

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
Having received the result, we will try to summarize this data

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
so that the points allocated to us are applicable to the organization as a whole.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
This is generalization.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
The most difficult and perhaps the most subtle point,

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
because when we conduct a study,

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
we, as we have repeatedly noted, must consider the specifics that exist in a particular department.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
Nevertheless, generalization allows us to go beyond this specificity.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
Accordingly, these are the three main characteristics of verification.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Validity, reliability and generalization.

48:42.000 --> 48:51.000
These are the characteristics that must be presented in the report of the study that we receive.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
In this regard, a very important issue is associated with the ethics of conducting the study.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
As for the Western approaches,

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
the ethics of the study plays a significant role there.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
Because when we receive certain results,

49:15.000 --> 49:22.000
we, the employees, must be sure that these results will not be used against them.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
These results are not aimed at getting rid of the unwanted,

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
getting rid of those who do not fit into the team.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
These results are aimed at optimizing the company's activities,

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
optimizing the company's activities.

49:39.000 --> 49:46.000
Accordingly, these results will not be used against people who participated in the study.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
This is the most subtle point.

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
Moreover, if all questions of ethics of the study have long been prescribed in the West,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
then as for the ethical tradition,

49:56.000 --> 50:04.000
it is unfortunate to note that often the concerns of employees about the fact that all these results,

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
all these surveys that they have filled out can be used against them, do not come true.

50:09.000 --> 50:21.000
Often this is exactly the contradiction that employees make with one or another study conducted in the organization.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
These are all those ethical issues that constantly arise in the relationship between people.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
And the level of their development indicates the maturity of the organization,

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
its prospects, its stability, and its reliability.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
The next issue that should be discussed and considered

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
is the tests and testing that are carried out in the organization.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
What does this mean?

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
Despite the fact that we have talked a lot about hypotheses,

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
about various kinds of variables, about validity, about reliability,

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
about different methods and methods of organizing behavior analysis,

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
about methods, about one or another topic of its study,

51:15.000 --> 51:23.000
it is still worth noting that the most common, the most common method of research

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
is not observation as the most optimal approach to solving the tasks that are set,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
but still testing.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Just because testing is quite simple.

51:34.000 --> 51:41.000
There are certain tests, and reliability, validity, standardization of these tests

51:41.000 --> 51:49.000
have already been tested many times in different organizations, and they are processed in different ways.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
As for the tests, there are a large number of methods used.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
Again, if we are talking about a scientific approach,

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
the methods that are used are a set of already recommended tests,

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
which are valid, reliable, and standardized.

52:09.000 --> 52:16.000
The problem is that very often in tests, there is a panacea,

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
that if a person passes a certain test, we can get complete information about him.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
This is not the case.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
A test is nothing more than a tool,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
and a tool that can be used in the hands of an experienced person,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
that is, in the hands of that person, that interpreter,

52:31.000 --> 52:38.000
who can get and analyze the data that is given from this test in one way or another.

52:38.000 --> 52:46.000
A test itself usually does not contain objective information about a person.

52:46.000 --> 52:53.000
And there is a tendency that the test never gives itself.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
It always gives the so-called battery of tests, or several tests,

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
which purposefully pursue the goal of identifying those or other characteristics of a person,

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
which may be useful, harmful, neutral, or useless for work.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
In this sense, when we talk about organizational behavior,

53:15.000 --> 53:22.000
tests are very often used as an analysis of already working employees,

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
in order to be able to make a judgment about how loyal the team is,

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
how successful the team is, how motivated the team is to work,

53:32.000 --> 53:39.000
how much the team is really able to achieve the goals set for it.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
But most often, tests are used in the reception of work.

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
Usually, in the arsenal of any HR specialist, HR manager of a serious company,

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
there is a certain set of tests that are standard for any company

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
that is subject to the applicants for a certain vacancy.

54:03.000 --> 54:10.000
As for testing, in the hands of skilled people, it can really be substantive.

54:10.000 --> 54:16.000
But again, it should not be forgotten that even live people are always responsible for the test.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
They can worry about this typical situation if a person comes to work.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
These people can be in a hurry, they can be busy,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
if we are talking about employees who are already working.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
Because what concerns testing, it is an additional load that is put on them,

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
and very often this testing is carried out outside of working hours,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
that is, due to personal time of employees.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
This is also a very common situation,

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
which immediately negatively adjusts the most loyal employee to the very testing procedure.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Instead of me going home after working a whole working day,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
I sit down and start answering questions.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
A good test is at least 100 questions.

54:55.000 --> 55:03.000
All these tests, 10, 15, 20 questions that we very often see on the last covers of glossy magazines or newspapers,

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
this is not a test, this is just a fun.

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
As for the real test that will give us the objective results we need,

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
a test that will give us results on the basis of which we will be able to implement

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
and identify any non-correlational connections,

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
these are tests that will contain 100, 200, or even more questions,

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
depending on the tasks that we have.

55:28.000 --> 55:35.000
Usually, when analyzing organizational behavior, when taking on the job,

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
four different types of tests are used.

55:39.000 --> 55:45.000
There may be more of them, but now we will just focus on those that are used most often

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
and which are most common.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
The first test is the ability test.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
Again, it is not worth thinking that if a person has answered these tests,

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
then you can say for sure whether he has the ability or not.

56:01.000 --> 56:08.000
Rather, these are tests on the ability of a person to apply the knowledge and skills he has

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
to solve the tasks that are put before him.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
It is from the point of view of the ability to apply one's knowledge

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
that any employee is evaluated.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
The ability tests are divided into tests of general abilities,

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
where we are talking about the ability to concentrate attention, memory,

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
the ability to find creative solutions in non-standard situations,

56:35.000 --> 56:45.000
and tests of special abilities that concern the need to perform a person's particular activity.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
If we are talking about an accountant, then it could be a test of attention.

56:49.000 --> 57:00.000
If we are talking about a manager, then it could be a test of organizational behavior,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
social skills, and so on.

57:03.000 --> 57:12.000
Accordingly, the ability tests are the first tests that are given to an employee or a candidate

57:12.000 --> 57:19.000
on a particular vacancy in order to assess his compatibility with the competencies

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
that are present in this position.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.000
The next type of tests that are used are the so-called personal tests.

57:28.000 --> 57:36.000
As for the personal tests, in this case, we will talk about the need to analyze

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
a person's personal qualities.

57:38.000 --> 57:45.000
A person has a lot of personal qualities, and various researchers,

57:45.000 --> 57:51.000
scientific researchers, offer different tests and highlight different qualities.

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
We will talk about the so-called big five personal qualities,

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
which you can see on the slide.

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
These are the personal qualities that are most traditionally highlighted

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
by employees both in the employment and in the working place.

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
The goal of this task is to identify personal characteristics that a person assesses

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
not from the point of view of his professional skills.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
This is more about the ability tests and professional skills tests,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
which we will talk about a little later.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
In this case, it is about personal characteristics, character, temperament,

58:31.000 --> 58:39.000
ability to establish communication, ability to avoid conflicts,

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
ability to overcome conflicts, ability to work in certain situations.

58:44.000 --> 58:53.000
As for the big five, it covers all the qualities that are necessarily present

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
in a variety of research.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
It is not necessary that they will be called as it is presented on the slide.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
The main thing is that in this case we are talking about these orientations,

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
these approaches and these methods of human behavior.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
The first one is about order, but not about significance.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Order does not matter here.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
The second one is about friendship, that is, the ability of a person

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
to communicate in a non-conflicting way in the organization in which he is.

59:22.000 --> 59:31.000
The ability of a person to be communicative and, accordingly,

59:31.000 --> 59:37.000
to organize professional activity according to the tasks,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
but not according to his personal stereotypes.

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
Ambitions are a good thing, but they should be appropriate.

59:46.000 --> 59:53.000
The next personal trait that I study with these tests is

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
intellectual and cultural openness to new experience.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
A person comes to work in any organization and, of course,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
he faces some new tasks, new conditions, new requirements,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
both for himself and for others.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Accordingly, a person should be able to adapt.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Someone does it easily, someone does it hard.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So-called rigid, tough people to change.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Since we are always in a changing situation,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
we should be ready to use and study new methods of work,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
new methods of functioning, as well as to reflect

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
those or other cultural changes that are taking place.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Again, as an example, we can assume that such professions,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
such specialties were very culturally in demand before,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
which were associated with scientific research,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
old disputes between physicists and engineers, and so on.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Now the situation has changed.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Now these criteria are no longer in demand.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Now business criteria are in demand, business competition criteria,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
the criteria for the purpose, for the result,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
the criteria for the ability to achieve specific results,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
the criteria for the purpose, for the ability to achieve goals,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
a variety of criteria for choosing means and methods

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
for achieving these goals.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
These are already cultural things,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
their assessment changes depending on the changes

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
that take place in the culture.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Very often, this is why most people who were successful

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
or, let's say, satisfied with their social status,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
which they had before,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
do not fit into the new social reality at the moment

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and are forced to either change,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
or go to another job,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
or list all the shortcomings that arise in society.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The next characteristic that is important in personal tests

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
is the presence of self-control.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Indeed, when we fall into any organization,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
we are forced to obey the rules of normal business behavior

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
to the conditions, to the norms of that corporate culture,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
to that corporate spirit,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and to the functions of that corporate mission

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that are already present in this organization.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
We could come from another organization

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
where we are used to a different way of behavior,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
where we are used to a different way of contact,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
to a different way of interaction.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
For example, very often there are bureaucratic problems

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
where in the previous organization it was easy to get a signature from the manager.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
In the new organization where I work,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I have to submit a certain amount of paperwork

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and wait for a certain time until I get a signature or a refusal.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
This may not please me,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
but if a person has joined a new organization,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
he must follow its rules.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Then these rules can be discussed.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Then these rules can be proposed and changed.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
But still, a person must understand

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
that being in a certain organization,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
he works, acts and works according to its rules.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
This is a function of self-control.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Very often, the problems and difficulties that arise in this situation

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
are associated with the inability of a person to have this particular personality quality.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The next feature, which is very important from the point of view of a personal test,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
is the energy of a person.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
How energetic is a person?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
How active is he?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Is he an extrovert or an introvert?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
An extrovert is an activist.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
This is a person who gets involved in any activity

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and does something until he gets some result.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Fast or slow?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
High quality or low quality?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
But here we are talking about the result.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
An introvert, on the contrary, is a thinker.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Before he does something,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
he will think for a long time.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
He will anticipate certain consequences,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
anticipate certain results.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And after a long time,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
the introvert will start doing something.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
First, he must calculate everything.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Of course, depending on the situation,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
on the sphere of activity that the company is engaged in,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
a person's personality qualities may or may not fit.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
If this is a broker who must react immediately to changes in the rating,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
then it will be very difficult for the introvert.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And it is really worth thinking

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
whether it is worth taking an introvert instead of a broker.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
This is the place of an extrovert.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
First, get involved, and then we will figure it out.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
If we are talking about analysts,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
financial analysts, business analysts,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
then this is, of course, the area of ​​the actions of introverts.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
This is the area of ​​analysis.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I must calculate possible paths, possible approaches.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And this is not the situation

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
when I first get involved, and then we'll see.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This is not what analysts are for.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, as for the fifth personality characteristic,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
which is understood,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
again, it is just the last in order, but not in significance,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
this is the emotional stability of a stable person.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Modern business is always a stressful thing.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Business is always stressful, especially in domestic conditions.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And business is very often working in uncertain conditions.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Business is in a tough time shortage.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Accordingly, if a person knows how to cope with a stressful situation,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
knows how to behave in a stressful situation,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
he becomes an irreplaceable employee.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And if a stressful situation knocks a person out of the rut,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and he does not know what to do,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
then, accordingly, perhaps he is not suitable

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
for solving the tasks that are prescribed

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
in the regular schedule,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
in the vacancy he claims.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
that this big five is called the big five,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
because it is the most frequently used,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the most frequently met and tested,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
pragmatically proven significance for a business of a personality characteristic.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Naturally, there are others.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
But in each case,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
you just need to look at how successful the results are

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
for your company when selecting an employee

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
using these or other tests.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
The next type of tests is the so-called honesty tests.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
In this case, this name causes people to have a wrong association.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
This is not about whether you are honest or a liar.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
In this case, it is about the loyalty of a person.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
How loyal is a person to the company,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and how much will he benefit the company.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.000
In this case, honesty is meant from the point of view of loyalty and competence for a person.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But not honesty as we are used to call it in the usual sense of the word,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
like lying or deception.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
This is exactly the situation when it is very important to understand

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
the operational definition of honesty that is given in this case.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And when we talk about tests,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
here it is the operational definition that is given,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
because each test is a specific procedure

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
for measuring certain qualities.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And no matter how funny it sounds,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
at first, the honesty test is just a test for the procedure of answers

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
to the questions of the corresponding test,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
from the point of view of corporate loyalty, corporate compatibility,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
from the point of view of finding your place in one or another organization.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The next tests that have recently received a fairly wide spread

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
are the tests of professional skills.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
What is this case about?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Very often, what happens?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
A person comes to work and is given a trial period of three months,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
if this is a private position,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
six months, if this is a top position.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And during these three or six months,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
during this period, the supervisor observes

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
whether a person copes with the responsibilities that are imposed on him,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
or he does not cope with them.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
After all, this is a fairly long period

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
during which the compatibility of this person is identified.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
As for the tests of professional skills,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
they are trying to solve the task of reducing these periods.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
These tests are designed to understand

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
how successful a person is in solving the tasks that lie ahead of him,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
what his professional competence is,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
how much his skills correspond to the list of competencies

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
that he must satisfy.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
As for these tests, they are very often implemented in the form of various cases.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
A person is given a typical task

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
with which he may face,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
take on a particular position,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
and it is considered how a person will solve this task.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Then the method of expert assessment is used,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
and the experts will decide in one way or another

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
whether the method proposed to these people is suitable for solving the task,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
whether the terms proposed to these people are suitable for solving the task,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000
whether disorganization is introduced into the work of any new team

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
under this method of solving the task.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That is, instead of spending six months,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
you understand that the higher the person's duty, the greater the cost of error.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So, in order not to spend six months in order to determine

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
whether a person's professional place corresponds to the task or not,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
this test is usually carried out during the day,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
for two or three days.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That is, all tests, it must be said,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
scientific tests, usually take a long time.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
This is not what I sat down and answered.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So, accordingly, two or three days are spent,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
sometimes even up to a week,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
but this period is enough to draw a conclusion

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000
whether a person will successfully cope with these or those professional actions,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
or not.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
These are the tests that are usually used.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
But again, it is necessary to understand that these tests are no more than

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.000
a way to get preliminary information about a person,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
about people working in an organization.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
This is a way to build a hypothesis.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It makes no sense to demand a definite result from a test.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yes or no.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:34.000
As for tests, there may be various errors, measurements, various errors.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And these errors can have a significant impact on the results.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Let's look at the next slide, which concerns experimental errors.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000
These are experimental errors in both tests, including experiments and observations.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
What we talked about.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
This is a kind of generalization of the previous material.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
There may be different sources of errors.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
They may be found in the test itself.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
If the criterion of reliability, validity, and standardization is lacking,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
these errors may be found in the person himself.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
He is worried.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
He feels bad.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
He is hungry.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
He is not in the mood today and does not want to answer the various results of the test.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
He considers this test as a distrust of himself and as a further way to get rid of it.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
All that we talked about in the study.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The source of the error may be the situation.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Again, a person is in a hurry somewhere.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
The person has the last day before vacation.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
The person has the last day before some kind of celebration.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And he is forced to answer these tests.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
This will also have an impact on them.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
In addition to the source of errors, errors can be constant, as we have already noted, and unpredictable, random.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If we take the same test, then very often, and I have no doubt that you, the person responsible for the test,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
could see typographical errors in this test.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Moreover, these would be errors in the questions themselves.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
This can be laughed at.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It is much more dangerous when typographical errors occur in the test processing.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And when we are here, we can get an incorrect result precisely because of the incorrectly typed key.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000
As for the person, any person, no matter how confident he is, no matter what level of ambition he has,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
when the test is taking place, he is always afraid of this test.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
He does not know his results.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
This is a situation of uncertainty.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And there is nothing more dangerous for a person than a situation of uncertainty.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
He always does not know what consequences this will have for him.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Well, as for the situation of constant errors, who?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000
The very fact of the presence of the fact that there are many people in the room who answer these or those tests

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
leads to the fact that I start to worry.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I start to think, if I answered worse than these people, if I answered incorrectly.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I start to look at how they answer to match their answers with their answers.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Here is the external factor.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Again, this is a constant error.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The very fact that a group of people is being put in order to conduct the test

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
is already the factor that leads to a red-hot error.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:40.000
These are the constant and distorting variables, by the way, that can be predicted and which are known.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But there are also a lot of random errors.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Again, if we are giving a test that is carried out on some material,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
then these materials can be of different degrees of clarity.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
We have mixed materials, received copies, and some copies are blurred.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I spend time to read, to understand.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
This is, again, unnecessary excitement or I consider it as disrespect to myself.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
That the neighbor was given a good option of questions, and I was given, and I can't figure it out.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So the neighbor will be evaluated better than me.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
This is a completely random and predictable error.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
This is my subjective opinion, it just happened so.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But it will affect the results.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Again, a random error.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
If a person thinks about something else, for example, an accountant thinks that he will be given a report to the Tax Inspection tomorrow,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
and here instead of doing it, he is given some tests.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I think about something else, I have a completely different direction of thought.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And, of course, I'm not interested, I'm just very carefully putting answers to questions on tests.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And, of course, the result will be inadequate.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Well, again, as for random errors, testing is carried out.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And there is some noise on the street, and cars are driving on the street, and music is playing on the street.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And, of course, it distracts my attention.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I leave the test to what arbitrarily distracts my attention.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
These are the errors that are really random, which are impossible to predict.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But they must be taken into account to get the result.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:24.000
So, let's sum up the preliminary results that concern the scientific method, the scientific methodology that we discussed.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:32.000
We considered the criteria of scientific organization behavior, how the research program is built,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
how data collection is carried out, what the object of research is, the subject of research,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
how validation, reliability and results are checked.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
When we get the results of the research, we must pay attention to these points.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:56.000
In order for the research to answer the questions that we asked as customers to the providers,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and so that we get the results that were needed.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.000
If we know these main points, these main criteria that should be paid attention to,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
then we will be able to assess how much the results of the testing,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
how much the results of the organizational investigation carried out by our organization really concern us,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:28.000
how much the funds that we invested in the research are paid with the results that we received,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
how useful these results may seem to us,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and how they will contribute to the development of the organization and its growth,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:47.000
competitiveness, increase in sales, increase in the development of its commercial niche.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
However, this is what concerns the ideological aspects.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Now we should talk about the approaches in organizational behavior,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
what are the concepts that have been recommended,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
which are based on the criteria that we talked about,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
which were studied according to the methodology that we discussed,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
and which really give us not just results,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:28.000
but also methods of impact and methods of correcting the situation that arose in our company.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
In this case, we will talk about cognitive and behavioral approaches,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
which are most often used in organizational behavior today.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So, we have considered the methodological approaches of scientific research on organizational behavior.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Now we know what variables, what criteria should be paid attention to

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000
when we analyze the materials that are presented to us by research organizations

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000
from the point of view of analysis and study of organizational behavior in our organization.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That is, we can now answer the question of what should be studied and how.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But here comes the most interesting difference between the scientific approach and the pragmatic approach.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
As for the scientific approach, in principle, we can stop at this,

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000
because the scientific approach is interested in providing tools for research, methods of obtaining results.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
When we talk about practice, of course, this is not enough for us.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It's all very interesting, it's all very good.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
However, we have a simple goal as pragmatists.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
We must get the final result.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
We have our company, we want to increase its performance,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
we want to take a higher place in the market,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
we want to enter a certain rating,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
we want to unite with a company, against a company,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
either to achieve certain commercial goals.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Therefore, after the question of how to do it and what to do,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
which is, of course, very good and interesting,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
the greater importance is given to another question.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
What are the ways to change the situation?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Here, again, scientific approaches are useful.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
They can be useful to us.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
However, as for scientific research,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
it is still a search for some general answers,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
general abstract descriptions of what can be done, how can be done and why can be done.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
We will, of course, use these very approaches.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
However, we have one question.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
We are not doing research.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
We have a specific business.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And now we want to apply these wonderful scientific results to our particular business.
