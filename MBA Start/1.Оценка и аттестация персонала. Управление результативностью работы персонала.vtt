WEBVTT

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.790
Dear colleagues, let me introduce myself.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.290
My name is Alexander

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.850
Alexandrovich, the name of the Crimea,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.070
but I would rather be called

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.110
San Sanitch.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.190
It is somewhat more comfortable.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.570
The topic we will discuss today

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.830
is called “Evaluation and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.230
Certification of Staff.”

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.770
In general, agree, it sounds pretty

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.250
boring, something like that,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.610
certification, some papers.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.910
In fact, I must tell you that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.330
of all the tools, of all

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.430
the topics that are related to the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.990
management of the human

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.090
resources of the enterprise,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.930
this is probably one of the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.350
most intriguing, mysterious, mysterious.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.510
If you don't believe me, let me

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.570
give you an example.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.650
I have been conducting interviews,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.770
surveys with business

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.710
directors, HR managers,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.590
HR directors for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410
three or five years

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.510
and asking two simple

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.430
questions.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.230
First, whether you have a staff

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.570
assessment in some format, and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.930
the second question, if you like

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.990
the way it goes.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.030
And with an astonishing stability of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.170
10-15% they say that yes, it is.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.870
It is necessary.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.510
It is our most valuable tool

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.230
that allows us to solve many problems.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.110
Another 25-30 percent presses their

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.330
shoulders and speaks, and why?

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.790
And finally, the other 60 percent

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.270
say, yes, it is, but we don't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.890
know why it exists,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.210
and we don't really understand

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.970
what to do with it, because

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.990
it, as they say, has no

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.650
use but harm.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.190
So the question arises, and Should

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.510
the company use the evaluation of personnel?

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.650
Because 25-30% of

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.330
our do not use it in any

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.630
way, it probably does not

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.170
need to.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.190
They live and, in general, they

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.590
live well.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.070
What do you do with the old 60%?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.950
I would formulate the overall goal

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.810
of our class with you approximately

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.570
like this.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.870
I would like that by the end of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.750
our class you very well understand

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.630
what is the evaluation of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.630
personnel, what purpose it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.210
serves, in what registers, in what

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.670
formats it can be used.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.650
And then you can decide on

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.890
your own, after talking to your

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.970
colleagues, whether you need a staff

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.650
assessment at the enterprise

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.450
or not.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.990
And if necessary, you can build

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.950
this assessment system on

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.090
your own or with the help of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.630
third-party consultants, make it

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.290
work, and you would fall into the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.650
first category.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.670
In addition, 10-15 percent

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.570
who would think it is necessary

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.890
work and bring results.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.940
I would like to immediately state that it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.320
will not be the case for any assessment of staff.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.680
Well, you know where the assessment is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.540
used in the practice of human resource

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.100
management, most of course, in the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.940
recruitment.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.980
When recruiting new people than

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.200
it differs primarily in that we these

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.340
people absolutely do not know what we

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.060
know about them what they wrote in the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.420
resume about themselves whether it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.620
is true or not we are not aware of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.560
reviews well may be tests results

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.580
interview anything more this is new

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.440
and for their research to evaluate

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.200
their changes their methods We will

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.540
talk about another assessment

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.740
of staff, about one that

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.720
relates exclusively to people

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.300
already working at our company.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.680
We have huge advantages,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.300
we know them well.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.320
Does this make our life much easier?

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.640
I fear not very much.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.480
To understand where problems

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.920
arise, where difficulties

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.580
arise, let's first agree

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.340
on terms and understand

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.980
them.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.920
And here we are waiting for the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.860
first and probably the most

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.000
serious to start, but if you want,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.520
a cultural shock.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.860
How many words do you know in

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.680
Russian that are related to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.360
the area we are discussing?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.980
Here are two I named, it is an assessment and an assessment.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.860
In English, if more precisely,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.540
in English business vocabulary.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.840
First, there is the concept of “Performance

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.080
Appraisal”, which in Russian

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.120
translates as “work assessment”

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.880
or “performance assessment”.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.560
The results of this “Performance Assessment”

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.620
are based on the “Performance

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.480
Review”.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.960
In addition, there is one word

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.100
that has already firmly entered our

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.800
business jargon – it is “assessment”.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.020
In English it means “assessment” and in

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.920
Russian it means “assessment”.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.420
I have no other word, unfortunately.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.440
Job evaluation is a concept

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.840
that refers to the evaluation not

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.800
of a person, his work, but to

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.620
the evaluation of the workplace,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.280
what a person should perform.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.760
No matter what, no matter how much, and

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.860
how much you have to pay for it.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.360
And, not so long ago, we learned

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.320
two other fashion concepts.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.320
This is KPI, you know, you've heard of it.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.660
Now everyone has heard him.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.560
Key Productivity Indicators are

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.000
nothing more than key performance

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.120
indicators, in Russian

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.620
K-P-E.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.120
Well, since we have finally

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.220
moved to the English

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.620
jargon with you, I will speak

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.300
KPI.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.580
We will look at this KPI in more detail

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.080
a little later.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.800
There is another technology called

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.080
Management By Objectives

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.340
(MBO), which is also directly

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.280
and directly related to the

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.900
evaluation of staff.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.260
The question arises why in Russian

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.540
we have so few words for the designation

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.540
of the rating, and in English so many.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.140
The answer is pretty simple.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.860
The fact is that our Russian

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.440
management, as we see it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.940
today, is only about a decade

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.120
and a half.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.060
From this, as we all know, there

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.280
were socialist forms and methods

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.640
of government adopted in the

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.520
Soviet Union, where everything

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.620
was extremely standardized, where

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.620
there were state standards

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.540
for everything, because the

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.900
state was the only employer

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.180
that we had.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.600
What about the West and the East?

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.300
There are as many employers as there

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.560
are companies.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.640
And each has its business, and each

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.320
has its specifics, and each has

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.000
its own characteristics.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.140
And so for about 100 years in

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.560
the West only did that developed

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.720
various technologies

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.220
that would help manage people

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.520
that would increase efficiency,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.520
productivity of work

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.500
that would meet new conditions,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.040
in particular, such requirements

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.160
as development, the constant

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.360
changes that we see in

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.080
the market and in management.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.640
We did not have any problems,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.960
so there was only an attestation.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.060
What is Certification?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.620
In a few words, it is the

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.660
most primitive, one can say, the initial

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.340
method of assessing personnel, which

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.860
was used in cases when giving

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.420
an objective assessment of

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.040
human work.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.260
Well, for example, in terms of

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.380
the number of employees, state

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.660
natural employees, there were no

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.040
others, engineers, scientists,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.560
officers.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.240
Once every few years, the manager

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.580
of each employee had to make

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.200
a text characterization for him.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.160
In general, it is quite arbitrary,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.700
although there were indications

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.120
that this characteristic should contain.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.840
Well, first of all, as

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.800
you guess, it's humanity, devotion,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.420
and so on, as well as moral

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.760
quality.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.280
After this, this characteristic was approved

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.720
by the certification commission,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.300
brought to the MOHO certification, and

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.260
according to the results of

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.920
this certification, a decision was

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.460
made on what to do with this person next.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.560
To leave, to dismiss, to be promoted.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.180
In short, by means of certification,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.480
what is called official

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.740
compliance was determined.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.160
Do you think it is only on

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.100
certification?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.360
Of course not.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.720
Of course, it is understandable that

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.600
about each employee, about each employee

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.660
in general, there was a certain opinion,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.600
and it was clear what his prospects were.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.980
This was a sort of summary

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.860
of results for a certain period.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.360
No wonder that these tests were

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.880
done formally.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.720
The results of these assessments were

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.200
known in advance.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.980
Nothing new they discovered, well,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.560
let's say, they just didn't

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.300
live on time.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.500
What about the other methods and

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.580
technologies of personnel assessment

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.800
that have been used and

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.880
developed by our Western colleagues?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.780
Well, let's start with performance

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.260
assessment, which I repeat, translates

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.700
as a work assessment.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.220
This is probably what

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.560
can be called in the Western model.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.280
What is she different?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.280
Mostly by its technology.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.200
This means that any manager

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.500
is obliged, for a certain period

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.300
of time, say, a year, in some cases

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.240
2-3 years, to submit for each

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.860
of his employees an assessment

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.540
of the results of his work.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.400
But, unlike our certification, the assessment

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.120
is given in a very strict standardized

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.980
form, where the positions are

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.320
indicated, the techniques are indicated,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.280
how to evaluate, what qualities

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.160
to evaluate, what results

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.100
to evaluate.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.560
And as a result, the same decisions

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.440
are made about how much a person

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.760
meets his position or not, how

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.000
much he has to pay, whether

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.400
he deserves promotion.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.720
These decisions are usually made in life.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.660
Performance assessment.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.660
As in reality, most systems, methods,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.020
and technologies of evaluation of personnel

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.380
are directly linked and incorporated

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.120
into the employment policy that

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.700
the company conducts.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720
In particular, performance

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.220
assessment, or work assessment,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.280
is usually implemented in

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.520
those enterprises where there is a

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.720
very strict system of selection and,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.480
say so, staff content.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.520
For example, there is a concept

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.520
either raise, or out, which

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.980
translates as “either grow, or

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.340
goodbye.”

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.520
According to the results of the annual evaluation

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.640
of work, all employees are divided into

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.780
three categories, category A, B and C.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.180
Employees of category A receive a promotion,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.780
employees of category B – a warning,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.620
and employees of category C receive

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.020
a envelope with a check and

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.180
the best wishes on the labour market.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.300
What is Performance Review?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.360
This is the same result of performance

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.860
assessment analysis, the document

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.300
that is prepared by the manager of

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.040
the employee on the results of

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.800
the assessment, and then stored

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.600
in his personal affair.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.640
And, as a rule, over a number of years,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.600
these performance reviews are

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.780
analyzed, and we see what happens

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.820
to him, he grows, he gets better,

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.920
he gets worse, what happens

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.140
to him and what decisions about

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.200
him need to be made in the future.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.820
The next technology is the

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.480
assessment technology I mentioned

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.900
earlier.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.020
We will consider it in detail separately.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.700
Let me say two words literally.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.980
This is quite a new technology.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.940
And the strawberry is given what it

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.480
was born in the American intelligence

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.180
services, it was created for a subtle,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.860
complex, detailed assessment of the

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.020
personality of a person in terms

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.360
of understanding his suitability

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.560
or inaptitude to perform

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.460
a certain job.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.760
I will only say that this

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.560
is a costly procedure.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.120
It is used rarely because

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.760
it is expensive.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.640
Well, where it is worth using it

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.940
or not to use it in your organization,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.180
we will talk separately and

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.740
try to deal with it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.120
The next concept of job evaluation

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.600
is an assessment not so much of

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.460
a person, but of the position he

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.920
holds in our organization.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.140
Or should occupy.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.320
Why is the job evaluation procedure necessary?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.700
Well, at least to understand

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.960
by what characteristics,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.160
by what parameters we

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.520
will evaluate the work

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.400
of a person.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.680
All these technologies are

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.080
closely linked.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.480
Now two words about the CPI promised, as well

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.900
as the MBO.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.180
KPI, strictly speaking, is not a technology

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.720
for personnel assessment.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.040
This is a modern method of

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.500
organizing business management in general.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.060
From top to bottom.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.400
This technology links the objectives

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.180
of the unit of each individual employee

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.260
to the objectives of the organization,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.960
the corporation as a whole, to

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.360
what it puts before itself, in

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.800
what direction it is going to develop.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.020
So here is an element of evaluation,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.420
but it does not play a major role,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.520
but rather it is a measuring

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.020
instrument that allows you

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.600
to support the organization

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.280
as a whole.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.180
The same can be said of Management

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.220
by Objectives, that is, management

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.460
of goals, but it is a softer

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.280
tool that is less related

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.440
to the needs of the

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.520
company as a whole and is more

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.380
focused on optimizing the

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.580
work of direct

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.140
managers with their subordinates.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.760


00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.820
As a rule, it is used in rapidly

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.940
growing organizations, where people

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.520
need not so much to perform

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.560
routine tasks, as to strive for

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.800
new ones, to master new areas,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.740
new achievements, and

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.220
so on.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.640
Here is a brief overview of the technologies,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.580
methods of assessment of personnel

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.080
that are now used worldwide.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.840
All the rest are some modifications

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.140
of these technologies in one way

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.900
or another.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.860
What combines all these technologies?

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.880


00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.020
There is a very important principle, colleagues.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.220
And, strictly speaking, a significant

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.460
part of what we will talk about

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.600
next will be devoted to analyzing

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.520
this principle.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.140
Unlike other HR

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.840
tools, staff assessment

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.000
is never an end

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.500
in itself.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.360
Let's look at other tools, such

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.160
as recruitment.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.000
Can the company work without employees?

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.680
No, it cannot

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.200
So they have to be hired.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.320
Motivation system and pay system.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.160
Will people work if we don't

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.920
pay them?

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.560
No, they will not.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.660
So, this must be done too.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.380
But, sorry, and the wave system also

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.800
exists, you need to update the staff

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.940
from time to time.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.400
And in modern organizations it is

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.300
still to be taught, because

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.880
the situation is changing, new

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.120
requirements, new technologies,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.020
especially information.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.860
Training is also needed.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.600
In fact, it is a goal in itself.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.640
But this evaluation itself is

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.540
never needed.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.300
And the deepest mistake is made by

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.560
those who are trying to implement

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.320
a staff assessment, well because

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.560
it's beautiful, it's great,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.860
someone has it, but we don't, and

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.480
we want everything to be like big ones.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.240
And I often have to hear such

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.660
a wonderful expression, something

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.120
I have employees

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.440
stuck, something to blur.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.020
We will do an assessment of staff.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.080
So, colleagues, the evaluation of the staff

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.260
as such is not necessary.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.220
And in some cases it will be more profitable

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.860
not to carry it out or give up it, so

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.620
as not to waste time, not to waste

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.160
resources and, say so, not to harm the

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.120
culture, organization,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.380
atmosphere in the organization

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.920
and the attitude of employees

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.920
to your organization.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.680
What follows from here?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.100
The main and most important thing

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.840
is to determine what your goals are.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.500
What do you dislike in

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.500
your company?

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.380
What would you like to do better?

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.760
What is hindering you?

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.100
We further determine to what

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.560
extent these goals can be

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.520
achieved by implementing staff assessment.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.820
Then we decide on what

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.860
methods, what tools can

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.860
be used here.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.080
This is the very content of

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.580
what we will talk about next.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.040
Since we have already found out that

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.720
the most important thing is to define

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.000
goals, let's designate those goals.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.120
When we talk about the purposes of personnel

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.300
assessment, it makes sense to remember

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.660
the metaphor that we know from marketing.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.700
Please tell me, do you need an electric drill?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.000
Someone will say yes, some will say no.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.080
I ask why?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.380
To burn or to turn beautifully?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.400
Most likely, it is not needed by

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.700
itself, but you need to have holes

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.000
in the walls.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.560
Can you get holes in the walls without

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.960
an electric drill?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.660
You can.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.340
Call the service office, the master

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.080
will come, make all these holes for you,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.220
hang your shelves and you will reach

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.340
the goal without having an electro-dredge.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.020
The same goes for staff assessment.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.320
It is just a management tool

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.940
that can be applied,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.180
but then you need to know why.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.160
You can not apply, then understand

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.200
why and how we will solve the

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.500
problems facing us, without

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.520
using the evaluation of staff.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.140
It is now appropriate

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.660
to see what these goals are.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.140
I know only five of them.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.520
The first is the audit of the company's

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.860
labor resources.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.240
What is it?

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.020
First of all, the workforce should

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.000
not be confused with what

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.020
is called the audit of personnel management.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.120
This is when it is studied to what extent

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.440
the company has the correctly drafted

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.240
labor contracts, personal affairs of employees

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.420
are conducted, orders are placed on the

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.400
spot, whether the labor books are

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.520
correctly filled up and so on.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.660
No, it is not about that.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.200
But, in general, it is

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.180
also useful.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.820
Audit of labor This is a situation when

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.160
we look at, and who works in our company?

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.200
How many people work here?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.300
Is it right that they work?

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.800
Audit is used to bring order in

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.580
the quantitative and qualitative

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.640
composition of the enterprise.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.780
How is it done?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.900
Audit of labor resources is the

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.180
only technology for assessing personnel

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.620
that does not always require

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.820
the participation of the staff

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.600
in this assessment.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.580
Half of the information

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.320
we get from auditing comes

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.300
from simple statistics

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.720
that are stored in

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.680
the company.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.280
According to personal composition, because

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.860
how many people were fired when they

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.520
were fired, how many were accepted,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.100
when they were accepted, how many they

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.960
worked and so on and so on.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.020
It is very important, of course, objective

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.080
indicators of the work of the units

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.800
and objective indicators of the

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.340
work of the employees themselves,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.180
that is, performance assessment, which,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.020
in principle, is quite possible to

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.020
implement, and not touching, what

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.060
is called, people.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.240
What results as a result?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.800
The main result is a report with

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.020
proposals for personnel decisions,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.820
whether we need to hire more

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.840
employees, whether we need to

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.060
get rid of someone, whether we

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.800
need to teach someone, and so on

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.500
and so on.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.440
All the recommendations that we

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.480
and you as HR managers can give to

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.820
the company's top management.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.160
The next task, the next goal of

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.360
personnel evaluation is motivation.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.560
Staff motivation is one of the most

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.620
painful topics that is constantly

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.400
discussed not only in our literature,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.820
but also in Western literature

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.480
devoted to personnel management

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.440
and general management.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.540
And it is far from just how

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.180
much people need and can

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.980
pay to work effectively.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.200
It has long been known that

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.820
if a person is overpaid, he

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.820
will most likely work worse.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.880
If a person is not paid, he will

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.380
most likely leave our organization.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.880
The remuneration is merely the

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.920
compensation we pay

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.020
a person in a monetary or other

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.400
form, as a payment for the

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.440
service he provides us, for

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.100
working for us and doing

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.600
the actions we want from

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.300
him and bringing us the

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.120
results we expect from him.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.500
What is different from this motivation?

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.240
Motivation is to help a person

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.500
in creating such internal

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.600
mechanisms that will push him

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.900
to work better, to work

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.120
in our company, to work on

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.200
conscience, to work, as

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
they say, with a focus

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.400
to bring serious results.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.960
One of the main tools

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.920
for motivating staff is

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.640
feedback.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.220
In order for a person to know

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.180
what is good, what is bad, how

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.960
he should work, how he should

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.520
not work, what he should, even

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.120
learn what qualities he

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.560
should develop, he needs to

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.820
receive feedback.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.480
Unfortunately, this feedback

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.200
is extremely rarely given

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.540
by our leaders.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.480
If given, it is usually

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.000
a negative feedback.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.740
In the format "it's done badly,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.120
it's done wrongly", well, and

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.400
as the famous joke goes,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.560
"I'd better sit at home and

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.520
then I'll get a promotion,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.880
because at work I'm noticed only

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.540
when I do something wrong."

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.220
Staff assessment is a powerful

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.740
tool that not only motivates employees,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.960
giving them not only negative but

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.120
also positive feedback, telling

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.540
them what the company expects

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.220
of them, what it thinks of

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.120
them, what prospects they expect

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.320
in the future.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.120
This is another powerful means of

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.480
raising the authority and increasing

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.140
the importance of line managers,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.840
first line managers in the

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.260
management of our own enterprises.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.200
Unfortunately, these leaders

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.520
are often not very willing

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.460
to lead people.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.900
They prefer to manage

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.620
technology, processes,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.600
results, but who should

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.220
lead people?

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.900
Probably the HR service.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.700
If you and I want the first

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.000
line managers to really

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.820
be responsible for their people,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.960
they really lead, then

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.800
feedback in the format, well,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.420
say the same, MBO, Management

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.540
Bio-Objectives, is absolutely

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.300
necessary.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.420
As a result, the picture at work,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.000
the attitude at work, the attitude

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.300
of the manager to the subordinates,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.380
the company's opinion about the

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.580
employee, the prospects of the employee

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.200
further in this company or their

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.680
absence, becomes transparent for

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.480
both parties.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.900
Of course, in such conditions, say,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.760
it works differently.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.700
The next goal for which the evaluation

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.100
of personnel can be used is to

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.700
create a reserve movement

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.020
in the company.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.140
What is sin?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.340
Our employers, when there is a job

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.960
vacancy of a manager, when there

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.040
is a job vacancy of a significant

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.800
character in the company, are more

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.140
likely to look for these people

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.020
in the labor market.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.900
There is such an illusion that

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.960
supposedly in the company we know people

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.340
and so they do not deserve

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.960
much, work for themselves

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.720
and work, but somewhere there are

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.820
those we need, and we must

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.940
find, we must work for ourselves,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.440
and then we will be fine.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.080
Unfortunately, the practice of the

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.620
last few years shows that the labor

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.080
market in our country has become

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.140
very complex.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.120
Finding people in the labor market has

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.340
become extremely difficult, and

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.940
the question arises that every large

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.460
company should create its own

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.820
domestic labor market.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.500
That is, first of all, to distinguish

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.820
among their own employees

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.680
those who are worthy in the

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.380
movement to lead other more

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.760
responsible positions.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.960
Otherwise, I fear that these our employees

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.220
will find their place in other

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.420
organizations where they will

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.160
be valued.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.420
How is it done?

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.180
To do this, you can use different

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.980
technologies, ranging from the listed

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.060
job evaluation, management by

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.120
objectives and ending with expensive

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.100
and complex serious assessment

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.700
procedures.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.640
But I recommend that this procedure be

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.880
used only in the extreme case, precisely

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.580
because this procedure is extremely

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.180
expensive.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.600
The same task can be solved much easier.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.240
What happens as a result?

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.100
As a result of this assessment,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.720
we get a list of people we

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.000
plan to nominate.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.520
In addition, individual training

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.340
plans, what and how we will teach

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.660
them, they are probably not

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.080
quite ready yet for the new positions.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.100
Planning a career in the company.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.380
We know how many candidates

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.760
we have who can take the

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.000
positions.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.080
Should we look for them somewhere

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.580
outside of our company or should we not?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.360
Or maybe there are really no

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.660
people in our company?

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.640
The next goal of staff assessment,

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.840
very closely related to

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.740
the previous one, is to identify

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.300
the needs of staff training.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.860
We all know and have heard repeatedly

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.840
that we now exist and are forced

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.460
to exist, develop and

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.400
grow in an environment where everything

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.780
is constantly changing.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.740
New technologies are emerging,

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.480
new requirements are emerging.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.750
New professions are emerging,

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.290
new specialisations are emerging, which

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.550
did not exist before.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.050
Unfortunately, most of these specialties,

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.410
most of these professions

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.730
are still not taught

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.990
anywhere.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.870
And companies have to train

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.610
themselves with their own resources

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.470
or by inviting external trainers

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.970
or teachers to create

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.750
their own training and

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.150
staff development systems.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.390
This problem ranges from

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.030
the simple need to re-train technical

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.810
personnel, well, let's

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:17.910
say the same repairers,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.210
equipment installers,

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.170
workers, new technologies,

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.530
new tools, new equipment,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.170
to a situation where we need

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.470
to teach our own managers,

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.270
that is, our own managers.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.510
We have organizations that teach them,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.010
but unfortunately, in most

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.910
cases they are taught theoretically.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.290
In addition, each company

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.370
has its own problems, has its

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.510
own bouquet of only inherent

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.590
situations, tasks, and

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.410
to solve these tasks is necessary

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.350
to teach employees of

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.050
this enterprise.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.230
What about training, because it is

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.090
very expensive.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.450
So we need to understand what

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.370
to learn.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.070
How can this be done?

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.730
The easiest option is to conduct

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.310
a survey of executives or employees

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.130
themselves about what you want In

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.670
fact, unfortunately, these surveys

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.990
are not always an objective answer

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.390
simply because people themselves

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.250
do not know, and what they

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.850
actually do not know.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.810
Therefore, in order to determine the real

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.430
needs of the company in the training

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.270
of personnel, especially managerial,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.770
it is necessary to run through

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.710
quite complex technologies,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.330
which we will discuss with you

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.530
in a separate section.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.990
What happens as a result?

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.330
As a result, we need to get a program

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.010
where the contingents of employees

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.870
will be indicated, their number,

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.890
what we are going to teach them, schedule

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.870
and, if possible, the estimate

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.930
for training.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.150
That is, if you want, a plan of assignments

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.810
to our HR department for staff training.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.610
Finally, there is such a very unpleasant

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.690
goal of conducting and evaluating

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.530
personnel as its reduction.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.230
What is sin?

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.990
Many of our companies are

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.730
simply bloated by states, and

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.850
in the captive stage there

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.270
is a need to understand who should

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.830
work and who should not.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.550
There may be a crisis that requires

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.910
savings from us, and as you

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.550
know, our staff is one of the

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.130
main items of our costs.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.070
Therefore, we have to look at

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.570
who we get rid of, on whom

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.890
we can save.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.650
New technologies may bring the need

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.670
to dismiss a whole number of employees

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.630
simply because in those positions

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.170
that our employees have performed,

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.130
the need for them disappears,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.970
well, if you want to replace

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.950
a machine or a computer program.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.870
How can this be done?

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.950
First of all, it is necessary to assess

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:49.890
the effectiveness of the

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.470
work of the units, and in each

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.050
unit the effectiveness, the effectiveness

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.970
of the work of employees.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.950
When we do, we get

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:03.450
a list of the jobs

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.830
we are going to cut.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.050
Why not just take it and make it?

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.630
The fact is that unfortunately,

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.910
when the company begins to

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.650
ferment and rumors that the

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.710
crisis, that the cuts, that what

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.870
is unknown what will be next,

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.750
the best employees immediately

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.070
start to look for new jobs, and

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.070
those who may not very believe

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.270
in themselves and maybe no one

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.050
needs in the labor market, they

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.290
will stick to their place, and

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.170
eventually you may find yourself

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.930
in a situation that you

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.870
will have a reduction of

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.830
staff naturally, but you

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.910
will get those who have

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.490
no more where to go.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:46.590
Do you want that?

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.530
Probably not.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.210
Therefore, the reduction of

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.210
staff should begin with the evaluation.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.610
If we summarize all five of the above

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.750
objectives of personnel assessment,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.710
then it will prove that the most common

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.730
of them is the employment audit.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.390
It practically affects both reduction

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.550
and motivation, and the creation

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.430
of a backup movement, and the

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.530
determination of learning

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.630
needs, but to a certain extent.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.930
This is, so to speak, a superficial

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.670
analysis of what is happening

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.630
in our company.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.090
It may not be necessary.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.670
It may prove that the company knows

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.730
who works on it, quite enough for

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.370
its personnel, but is going

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.910
to take care of the reserve

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.830
of nomination, development.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.530
Then these two goals come to the

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.370
forefront, the rest we can not

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.390
touch and not resort to complex

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.190
assessment systems to implement them.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.870
It may be that in our company

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.270
there is an increased flow

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.070
of personnel, then we need to do motivation.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.670
And it may be that our company

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.690
is in a situation of implementing

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.830
serious changes, from each employee

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.510
requires something that

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.790
was not required from

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.610
him further.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.430
Then again we have to resort

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.630
to technologies associated

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.710
with motivation, self-development

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.050
of personnel.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.870
But I repeat, the audit of labor

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.170
resources is, so to speak, just a little bit.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:08.770
The last issue that needs to be addressed

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.950
in connection with the objectives of the

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.850
staff assessment is the relationship

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.110
with or assessment of the staff from

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:19.290
the stage of development of our company.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.270
If we look closely at our Russian

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.810
business, we will see that a very

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.950
significant part of our enterprises

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.710
has undergone a certain

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.430
cycle of development.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.970
But in general, almost all

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:32.530
around the world are

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.970
going through the same

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.970
cycle of development, but

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.770
at different rates.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.710
These rates can take several years

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.950
or decades, and can take

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.230
centuries.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.630
The first is when our organization

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.270
just emerged, it is when it is

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.430
still small, it is when everyone

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.570
knows each other.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.430
It often happens that everyone does their

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.030
work on the principle of "everyone

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.890
is responsible for everything" and "taking

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.210
more, throw on", and generally achieving results.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.350
There are 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 people

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.870
in our company.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.210
Everyone knows each other, and why

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.110
do we need an assessment?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.110
Practically for such a company, the

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.490
assessment is, if you want, a fashionable

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.830
lotion, expressed in modern

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.330
jargon, which really does not

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.250
solve any company goals, because the

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.970
company does not yet have such goals

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.130
that need to be solved

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.730
with the help of personnel

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.470
assessment technology.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.390
The only case you can imagine here

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.010
is when the management changes

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.190
in the company and that new

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.770
management wants to know who

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.150
works there.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.990
And if our enterprise has overcome

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.390
or stuck at this stage, if our

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.730
enterprise has overcome this

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.290
remarkable stage, then, and

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.810
this is now a very characteristic

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.470
trend of our management,

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.890
our market, it is experiencing

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.930
a stage of rapid growth.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.290
Money is more and more, functions

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.930
are more and more, ideas are

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.530
more and more, let's recruit people,

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.830
the more, the better.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.870
During this period we observe, as a rule,

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.910
uncontrolled growth in the number

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:13.050
of employees of the company.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:15.810
Every manager goes to the director

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:16.950
and cries that he needs

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.730
an assistant, he needs

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.490
two assistants, he needs

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.030
four assistants, and my

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.810
people generally don't.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.630
The departments of HR management are only

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.130
dealing with what they are looking

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.870
for and hiring these new assistants,

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.410
but all this happens until a certain

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.370
stage, when the head of the enterprise

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.030
opens the payment report, looks

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.950
at it and is terrified.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.030
He says what it is, look, we

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.070
don't get productivity,

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.130
and the people twice as much

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.670
as we spend on these people.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.290


00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.770
No, he says, it is impossible for us.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.890
Soon to release the whole ballast.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.690
And here too it often turns

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.070
out that they are not dismissed at

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.250
all those who should be.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.430
And so at this stage for the company

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.230
is useful, I would say, it is absolutely

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.510
necessary to conduct an audit

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.490
of labor resources.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.190
If such an audit has occurred, in

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.630
the future our company may perceive

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.890
two fates.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.050
Destiny number one is happy.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.710
This means that the company will continue

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.110
to grow and continue to develop in the

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:22.810
market.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.530
And one of the main problems

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.430
of this company will be the improvement,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.510
and in some cases the creation

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.330
of a normal, modern,

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.310
transparent management system,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.090
including in the part concerning

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.090
labor resources.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.150
And then, although the

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.430
problem of labor resources is nowhere,

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.130
and as with any order, yet once

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.750
every few years, at least it is

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.190
necessary to carry out it, the

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.590
first place is such tasks,

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.430
such goals as personnel development,

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.290
reserve movement, motivation

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.030
of personnel.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.150
But there may be another problem.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.950
The problem is very unpleasant, and if

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.010
a company suddenly stops growing,

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.070
it starts to shrink because it grew,

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.290
it grew, and suddenly something

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.830
happened to the market.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.990
The redistribution of property, the

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.550
change of technology, the

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.370
emergence of such technologies of

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:20.990
goods that did not exist before.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.770
Take, for example, what we

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.290
have seen recently.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.130
The ubiquitous presence of

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.050
film devices, cameras

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.290
to date has almost replaced

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.170
digital.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.750
From this it follows that those resources,

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.930
labor which were in demand in the

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.910
production and maintenance of

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.790
the industry of film appliances

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.910
for domestic use, they are now

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.610
left unwanted, because printing

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.130
is no longer necessary,

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.090
show no need, everyone does it

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.430
at home on a printer or just

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.570
look at their photos on the

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.410
screen of a TV or computer.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.390
Such examples, especially in our

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.250
turbulent times, are very many.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.830
And it is very often that the

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.050
company is either forced to completely

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.850
re-profile, or it simply

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.270
does not work.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.870
Then there is a decline.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.270
If the company wants to stay on the

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.750
market at least in some quality,

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.090
then it is necessary to conduct an

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.750
audit of labor resources for the purpose

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.810
of identifying lists for reduction.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.990
What happens if such a disaster does

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.730
not occur, companies remain

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.870
on the market and continue to thrive.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.490
As a rule, after a period of growth

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.890
there is a certain period of stagnation,

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.250
rather stabilization.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.510
When companies stop growing, it has

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.290
taken its niche in the market, its

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.370
product is in demand, its brand

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.290
is known again in demand,

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.630
and the need for growth is

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.070
no longer.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.370
There is a need to improve the

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.730
quality of staff.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.950
And here again, the first place is

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.170
put forward by the personnel assessment

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.850
goals, such as development, creation

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.090
of a reserve movement and motivation.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.470
So colleagues are important.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.050
When you start developing your company's

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.630
staff assessment system, or

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.450
trying to understand why the

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.150
system you're using is working

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.570
badly, it's very sharp to see

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.790
what stage of development

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.910
your company is at and what

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.910
goals you want, you can and

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.490
should put before the staff

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.570
assessment.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.110
And the last question.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.950
It is to understand, and whether

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.290
it is worth it to carry out and whether it

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.610
is not worth using any other tools

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.770
instead, the question of effectiveness.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.790
What is Efficiency?

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.650
These are the results that you and

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.210
I have achieved or are trying

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.250
to in relation to the costs

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.150
we have to incur, because

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.330
nothing in this world is

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.950
given for free.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.450
In order to assess the effectiveness

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.590
of the staff assessment or to predict

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.830
what efficiency we intend to,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.630
we need to understand how we

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:15.810
can estimate the cost of carrying

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:20.030
out that assessment itself.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.790
In order to understand how much the

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.430
staff assessment costs, we

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.810
need to calculate the costs.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.330
Unfortunately, when you and

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.450
I try to count personnel

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.210
costs in any register, we

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.290
generally only count direct costs.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.890
All the money we

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.310
spend on staff is

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.090
salary.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.010
In fact, it is of course not so.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.930
The company's cost of staffing

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.610
is several times higher.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.090
Some articles cannot be

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:51.150
evaluated.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.050
But let's look at at least what the

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.110
company will cost the evaluation

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.250
of staff in terms of working

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.550
hours, working hours.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.810
Suppose you and I want to conduct

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.450
an assessment or certification

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.910
of 100 people, of which

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.670
we have 80 people of

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.270
ordinary staff, 20 first

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.930
line managers and 4

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.390
senior managers.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.050
If you look into the context of

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.670
our lecture, you will find there a

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.290
very detailed and detailed solution

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.750
to this task.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.490
Now I will not discuss it, I

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.130
hope you read it, see it yourself,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:35.250
I will answer.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.530
Even if each of these employees

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.790
bear an hour or two of the workload

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.570
of the staff, we will

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.790
eventually get such an unpleasant

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.530
thing as about 320 hours

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:53.630
or 40 working days, 40

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.730
human days.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.330
Your company is prepared to

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.910
lose 40 human days to evaluate

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.170
staff.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:02.990
Some may think that it is nonsense

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.210
and little things, and for some it

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.030
is very much.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.990
But this 40 working days estimate

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.470
only concerns the direct labor costs

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.870
of conducting the assessment.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.670
About hearing, judgment, about conversations

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.890
in the corridor and in the smoker, about reasoning.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.450
Multiply those 40 hours by two

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.970
and a half or by 3, and then

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.070
you will get a fairly accurate

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.130
idea of what your company

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.970
will pay for conducting staff

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.130
assessments.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.430
I add one more.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.890
Unfortunately, most of this working

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.070
time will go on the shoulders

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.890
of no one but the top and middle-

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.410
level managers.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.250
And these people, if your company

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.550
is working seriously, and

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.430
so busy enough.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:54.150
What follows from this?

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.870
Very simple morality.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.670
When engaged in the creation, development

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.830
and implementation of personal

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.450
enterprise assessment systems,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.810
try to save the participants' labor

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.550
costs as much as possible.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:07.970
How to do it?

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.110
To do this, you need to choose

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.210
an adequate assessment technology

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.590
for your task.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.990
These technologies will be devoted

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.010
to the next part of our class

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.230
with you.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.470
And now, while the head is still

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.250
fresh, please open your workbooks

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.490
and try to perform the exercises

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:36.390
on the first part of our class.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.930
So, colleagues, if you have successfully

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.730
overcome the first section of our

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.490
workbook, I suggest you move to

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.050
the second section of our class

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.890
dedicated to personnel assessment

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.670
technologies.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.810
How to choose technology?

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.850
This requires a small analytical

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.150
path.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.850
First, we need to reach the goals

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.410
we are pursuing.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.750
And you probably remember that goals

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.790
are the most important thing we need

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.510
to understand well in order to conduct

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.790
a qualitative evaluation of staff.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.910
Second, we need to understand what we

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.490
are going to assess, who we are going

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.830
to evaluate, and the reasonable question,

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.290
and who will evaluate.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.110
Once we have determined all

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.670
these parameters, we need to

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.730
calculate what it will cost us.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.890
How to count, we know from

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.190
the final part of our

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.570
previous class.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:55.410
Finally, after optimizing costs,

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.670
we choose the technology and methods

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.190
of assessment and can proceed to the implementation

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.590
of our project.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.770
Let us briefly go through the questions

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.530
of what to evaluate, who to evaluate

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.670
and who will evaluate.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.530
So what can be assessed?

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.710
And, in general, we don't have so many

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.250
positions that can be evaluated

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.110
in the work of the staff.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.250
Well, the first is, in fact, the results

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.210
of the work and achievements of the

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.650
employee at the workplace.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.410
There are special methods for this,

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.050
and we will consider them separately

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.230
and in detail.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:37.070
The second is qualification, knowledge

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.770
and skill, as well as such a mysterious

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.050
thing as competence.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.010
You will immediately say that competence

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.110
is also a fairly new concept,

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.850
he is somewhere about 15 years

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.350
old, not fully understand what

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.130
it is.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.870
Clearly, this is some sort of alloy

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.470
of these very knowledge, skills, personal

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.190
qualities that ensure the successful

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.970
work of a person in a particular

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.210
workplace, the performance of

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.550
certain functions.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.610
What else can we evaluate?

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.270
The behavior.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:18.490
How does a man behave How

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:19.710
does he treat his work?

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.290
Is he interested in it or not?

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.070
Does he show motivation for

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.250
this work or is he a shallow-valley?

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.710
Is he always at

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.270
work?

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.990
Or is it easier to find it in the cigarette?

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.330
Or is he busy eating lunch?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.150
What else can be assessed?

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.030
of satisfaction.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.310
Satisfaction of whom?

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.370
First the man himself.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.590
And there is a concept of self-

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.290
esteem, which usually includes

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.630
the outwardness of

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.390
a person, both of himself

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.830
and the work he performs.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.930
And besides this, we will still

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.210
talk about the extravagance of the external

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.150
and internal clients of our character

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.750
being evaluated.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.770
What is an external client?

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:04.190
This is more or less understandable.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.330
These are the people with whom our

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.510
hero interacts outside our organization.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.130
If it is the sales manager, then

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.690
it is its buyers.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.270
If it is a advertising specialist

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.950
who provides customers with

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.610
our advertising products, then

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.210
it is the customers who

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.830
purchase these products.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.590
There are internal clients.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.590
These are the employees of our

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.010
organization with whom the

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.990
person we provide directly interacts.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000


00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.180


00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.380
These are participants

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.180
in those business processes that

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:42.200
are embedded in the workplace of our character.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.520
These are the people who get

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.660
results directly from him, and

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.320
those whose results he

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.340
benefits.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.380
That is, in general, all that is.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.300
There is nothing else to

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.560
tell you except one small

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.500
but important detail.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.120
This is the dynamics of all these indicators

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:02.680
over time.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.900
And what, customer satisfaction or

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.600
behavior, or qualification in a year,

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.800
two, three, a person improved

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.040
or worsened, or remained

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.180
the same?

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.900
It is extremely important for us to know

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.680
this to determine the prospects of that

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.020
person and to understand what to do

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.940
with him next.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.900
This is the purpose of our

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.140
assessment.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.260
The second important question is, who

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.160
will we evaluate?

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.440
I will not be long in the tree,

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.540
I will say only one thing.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.780
The only format, the only way,

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.400
the only purpose of assessing

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.900
staff, which implies assessing

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.400
everyone, is, right, you thought

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.840
right, it is an audit of

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.820
the workforce.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.660
In the vast majority of other cases,

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.180
we do not need to evaluate

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.580
them all in a row.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.160
It is too hard and too difficult.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.920
Determination of the contingent

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.980
of people being evaluated is one of

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.220
the important tasks of planning and

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.020
planning the evaluation of personnel.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.000
The next question is, who can evaluate?

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.200
And here it turns out that we do not

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.120
have so many possible options.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.260
Well, let's start with the

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.980
fact that in the vast majority of

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.780
cases the assessment takes

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.140
the most immediate can be central.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.320
This is the direct manager

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.840
of our valued employee.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.060
Why is it?

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.580
Yes, simply because he is responsible

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.440
for his work, is most interested

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.780
in his subordinate work

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.260
well, but most importantly

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.860
he knows him best.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.660
And he knows from the position above

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.660
and can from this position from

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.080
the top, that is, from the

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.340
position of the management of

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.420
the company, to assess how well a given

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.180
employee is suited to this job, good

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.820
or bad, and what he needs to

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.800
do to become quite good.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.000
Who can evaluate the employee?

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.680
Well, if we remember what certification

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.580
is, then in the head, of

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.660
course, comes up such a concept

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.240
as a commission.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.840
A commission of employees,

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.500
usually managers, which is

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.220
specifically created to confirm

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.160
or not confirm, approve,

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.660
agree, develop, supplement

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.940
the assessment given

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.260
directly by

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.460
the managers.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.020
So, if we take two positions

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.040
with you – the assessors are the

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.460
manager and the commission, then

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.840
we get the most classic certification

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.560
that was discussed before.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.120
Who can participate in the evaluation?

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.580
We have already talked about the fact

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.060
that there is such a format of evaluation

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.060
of personnel as the evaluation itself, and

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.400
what a person thinks of himself.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.480
And if the assessors are two characters

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.900
– the manager and the employee

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.920
directly assessed, then we

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.360
get the management technology

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.380
for the goals of Management by

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.440
objectives, because it is based

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.060
on the fact that the managers

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.520
not only give an assessment

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.840
to their employee, but they

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.640
jointly discuss what the

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.500
employee's goals are and

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.080
what he intends to do to

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.460
those goals.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.340
And also how he understands, and what he has already

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.540
realized, and what is not, what is important,

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.080
and what is not important.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.060
And who else?

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:09.720
and ah.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.700
It is easy to remember colleagues,

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.680
subordinates of our person being evaluated,

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.780
if they are present

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.360
with him, well as external and

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.680
internal clients.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.740
What happens if the assessment will

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.580
be involved the manager, colleagues-

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.200
in-law, and may also be the

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.160
character being evaluated.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.820
It will be the very very fashionable

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.420
method, which is very much spoken

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.340
about, is a 360-degree assessment

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.220
or so-called circular

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.400
assessment.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.380
This is when we get an assessment

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.200
of this employee from all sides.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.040
From above, from side, from below,

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.540
and it can even be from the company,

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.080
and maybe from him himself.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.720
Well, well, beautiful, elegant,

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.540
fashionable, it is believed that objectively

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.620
one problem is very expensive

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.160
and very difficult.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.500
And if you and I remember how much

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.800
a simple assessment of staff

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.640
costs by direct managers, then

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.020
if we use a 360-degree assessment,

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.800
then let us multiply our labor

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.960
costs somewhere by 4,

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.220
by 5.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.360
Let us think if we should

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.500
use this assessment.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.060
Are the results we

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.620
get worth such a

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.340
huge cost?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
But finally, a little different

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.520
from all these technologies

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.200
is a situation where the

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200
assessors are an outside

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.380
group of experts.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.260
It is absolutely essential that the

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.460
company's employees, the managers

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.000
of our person who is being assessed,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.080
do not participate in the assessment,

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.520
and do not take into account the

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.460
results of the work that they have achieved.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.420
It is the technology of the expert assessment

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.220
center, as well as the technology of the

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.160
development center, which are one of the

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.800
versions of this technology.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.180
This is all the technology

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.700
we know.

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.500
Now we will look at these technologies

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.460
in more detail and try to understand

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.700
what their advantages are, what their

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.940
disadvantages are, what purpose they

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.080
can serve, how effective they

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.200
are and whether or not you should

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.900
use these technologies in

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:25.760
your work.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.600
Let's start our technology

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.500
review with the most broad,

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.780
common, the most important, which

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.660
is recommended to use by

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.940
almost all companies which

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.420
is called, yes, absolutely true,

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.180
an audit of labor resources.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.740
How can this be done?

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.560
We and you should take lists

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.660
of all employees of our company

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.140
in all units.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.920
For each of these employees, more precisely

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.040
for each of these jobs, we must determine

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.100
the performance indicators and

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.200
give a certain assessment

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.780
then we can get and can not get the

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.400
feedback of managers repeat there

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.820
are situations when it can be done

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.640
and without reviews but it is better

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.000
of course to get them how to do

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.580
this we will consider again

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.180
a little more in detail later in

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.900
addition to this for us important

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.160
such thing as the older experience

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.800
of this employee naturally the

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.320
longer he works at our enterprise

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.240
darker prices for us his resource

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.900
and maybe the opposite, what is

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.160
called, does not have time for

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.920
the development of our enterprise.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.780
He can do what he could and

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.600
should have done before.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.360
He is not doing what

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.140
he should do today.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.120
Well, as well as other significant

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.800
factors that can influence

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.980
our management decisions.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.100
What decisions can be made on the

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.060
basis of the audit work resources?

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.220
For each character of

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.040
our organization, we decide

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.960
that it matches the position

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.340
and let it work on.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.720
About the fact that it should be

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.320
carried out his move to another position

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.200
and may even be in another

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.600
unit, that is, rotation, we can include

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.960
this person in the reserve movement,

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.960
we can decide on the upgrading

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.840
of qualification, well,

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.040
and in addition, we can decide

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.140
on the need to replace

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.420
this employee, if he,

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.540
as they say, does

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.840
not pull.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.940
If an employee matches the

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.840
position or if we are making a

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.920
decision about it, it may be worth

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.160
thinking about how to encourage them.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.840
He may not be ready to take on

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.240
more important, more responsible

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.500
positions, to do more complex

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.200
and responsible work, but at the

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.500
same time he has been working

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.160
for us for a long time.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.820
And if we do not add his

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.280
salary, do not come up with

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.300
another form of his encouragement,

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.500
he can get upset and find

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.500
a place with another employer.

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.260
If we decide to include people

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.580
in the reserve movement and

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.840
the need for improvement in skills,

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.900
we may have to conduct an in-

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.380
depth assessment after an

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.640
audit on this narrower

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.200
contingent.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.560
That is, first to allocate

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.120
a broader contingent on the basis

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.920
of an audit, and then, using

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.580
more subtle but, of course,

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.280
expensive assessment methods,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.100
to select a so-called small list

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.440
of these characters.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.420
What happens at the end

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.820
of all this event?

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.960
summary report on our company,

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.020
which lies on the table of the Higher

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.240
Management and accordingly contains

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.420
our suggestions, recommendations,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.640
an assessment of the situation on

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.100
the enterprise as a whole, well,

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.560
and on how we can continue with

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.540
you to lead the personnel policy,

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.500
what actions to take, or we

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.540
are all well, or we are well,

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.000
but can be even better.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.300
This is the entire audit technology.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.380
I repeat, this is the most broad

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.760
generalized method of assessing

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.740
staff, which in the maximum degree

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.900
engages the most diverse data

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.800
present in the organization

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.020
and which is primarily aimed at

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.860
introducing order, which is extremely

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.580
important when conducting an

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.040
audit, so that it is conducted

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.180
periodically, so that we at the

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.160
next See where we are moving,

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.960
what our dynamics are positive

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.240
or negative, we have

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.000
achieved what we wanted to

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.020
or vice versa failed with us,

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.400
and if it did not work,

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.280
then why.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.640
The next HR assessment technology

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.140
I would like to consider

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:35.300
is MBO, Management by Objectives

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:39.320
or, yes, management by

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.920
objectives.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.600
It is not just an assessment technology,

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.820
it is a management technology

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.540
that motivates the management

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.480
of subordinates directly

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.560
in the units, and solves

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.380
four tasks at once.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.140
It motivates employees, and, most

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.180
importantly, increases their engagement

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.120
and loyalty, and allows for the

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.540
formation of a reserve of movement,

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.900
and, most importantly, as we already

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.140
increase the responsibility

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.600
of line managers for their employees.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.560
How is this done?

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.540
It begins with the indication

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.480
of the objectives of the unit in

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.700
which our employee works.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.940
These objectives are discussed collectively with

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.760
the entire personal composition.

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:33.540
There are ideas, statements, considerations.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.940
On the basis of these considerations,

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.120
ideas, statements, each of our

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.160
employees writes their own individual

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.380
plans, containing the goals that

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.420
employees intend to implement,

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.700
so that the unit as

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.900
a whole realizes their

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.680
goals.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.860
In other words, my contribution to the total treasury.

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.560
It should be noted that this is not just

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.700
work achievements.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.300
The courts can also include such goals

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.560
as new areas of work, the development

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.440
of new technologies, study,

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.860
knowledge acquisition, experience

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.400
acquisition, can even

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.060
change in behavior.

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.800
After that, the direct leader

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.980
talks with each subordinate,

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.320
discuss these plans.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.600
What is so important here?

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.480
It is not the appointment

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.940
of a plan to an employee, it is the

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.240
joint work of the employee's

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.740
executives that generates

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.000
a common vision of what should

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.900
be done next.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.460
This can happen once every

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.740
six months, it can happen once

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.500
a quarter, it can happen once

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.740
a year, but the results

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.000
periodically provide

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.020
feedback.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.180
That is, according to the schedule

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.200
plan, which was drafted in the process

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.700
of joint creativity, the manager

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.340
from time to time meets with

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.080
the subordinate and they discuss

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.520
what happened, what is not, what

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.400
goals are realized, which are not

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.360
quite realized, well, and maybe

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.720
there are some goals worth removing

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.880
if they have lost relevance

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.500
or set new goals.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.360
What is very important is that in the

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.400
process of this work, not only the objectives

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.340
that are put before the

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.920
employee are discussed, but also what

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.060
results he can get himself, for example,

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.180
what he needs to get into

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.580
the reserve of movement.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.320
Or he wants to do large projects,

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.580
which he has not yet participated

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.360
in, please, before him are set goals,

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.680
according to the results of

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.040
which they will jointly decide,

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.840
you can entrust him such projects,

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.540
such a more complex

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.040
work or not.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.980
Thus, I repeat, management

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.860
by goals is a situation where the

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.600
assessments themselves are not very

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.200
visible.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.620
It is rather in the current mode

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.540
the constant communication

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.480
between the leader and his subordinates,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.040
which stimulates the subordinates,

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.520
shows the leader who is moving

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.500
in which direction.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.400
But if there is a need, as a

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.400
rule, it is, then for

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.920
a certain period, most often managers

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.560
submit the relevant assessment

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.980
sheets to the staff management

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.860
service and summarize

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.620
the company as a whole.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.440
Good technology, good, I like

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.400
it very much.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.200
Can you be insured in your company?

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.420
A difficult question.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.440
Unfortunately, one of the problems

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.800
we are facing now is the problem,

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.920
well, say, not high enough

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.140
competence of managers

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.880
of the middle and take the attempt

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.300
to implement management on the

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.980
goal as something artificial

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.240
who-somebody and fear this is quite

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.160
a common situation relates

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.760
to this purely formally and it turns

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.840
out that in the end all our initiatives

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.440
it does not generally bring

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.700
the expected results gently

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.100
expressed only if we do not have

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.240
data on the same United States

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.180
and Europe where the management

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.320
system on the goal is implemented,

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.680
but not very well

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.600
working.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.000
Why is it?

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.360
The introduction of a new, serious,

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.860
affecting many people in the

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.700
company of the management system,

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.620
always meets resistance.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.780
I started slowly bringing you to

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.640
this topic.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.900
We will talk about it in more detail later.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.920
The next issue that we would like to

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.980
consider is the use in personnel

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.360
assessment systems, quite a

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.160
new fashionable, well-known,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.400
popular methodology, such as

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:28.080
the KPI system, Key Productivity

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.400
Indicators, that is, key

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.040
performance indicators.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.920
Like the previous technologies

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.720
we considered, it's much

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.960
more than just one of the staff

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.500
assessment technologies.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.820
Moreover, there is nothing evaluated

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.060
from what we discussed before,

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.720
except one – you have achieved

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.780
the indicators that you

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.020
were assigned or not.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.920
If you have achieved it is good,

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.360
you are good, you can count on

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.240
encouragement, you can count on

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.780
promotion and so on.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.700
If it fails, then bad with all

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.860
the consequences that follow from this.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.260
Can and should you use

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.640
this system in your

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.840
company?

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.980
The fact is that very many of our

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.080
leaders consider the KPI system as

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.220
some very tough, somewhere even

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.180
inhumane such a pro-Western technology

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.380
that clears the concept of a

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.580
person, reduces everything

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.620
only to some indicators, and therefore

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.340
is not very willing to use it.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.460
Others, less humanistically

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.240
attuned, hold the view that

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.700
we have the main clarity,

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.840
are those indicators evil to

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.960
reach them, and therefore KPI

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.000
is a very useful thing

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.720
to implement.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.140
To understand if this is true,

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.420
literally a few words.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.700
What is this system and how does

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.400
it work?

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.120
What is its meaning?

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.320
An organization, such as a

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.780
large corporation, sets its strategic

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.820
goals for a rather long

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.100
period of time.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.360
What could be the company's strategic

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.840
goal?

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.020
Well, imagine, there was no Russian

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.340
in the markets, and she wants

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.620
to appear here and even

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.400
build a factory and start producing

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.360
our products here with

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.320
our Russian labor resources.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.080
A noble purpose, a noble purpose.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.560
Either go into a market where it hasn't

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.580
been present before, or master

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.940
products it hasn't produced before,

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.680
or introduce information

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.160
technology that hasn't been present

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:28.920
before.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:29.860
and worthy?

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.380
Yes it decent.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.680
But it is necessary to remember that

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.120
this is a task that requires a

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.060
million or a billion investments,

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.940
which requires the intensive work

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.080
of almost the entire enterprise,

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.460
which covers a huge number

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.120
of people and is planned for years.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.400
On the basis of such

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.200
a strategic plan is formed the system

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.020
of KPI-corporation.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.060
On the basis of the KPI-corporation,

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.840
the KPI is formed for its departments.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.880
It is clear that in order to

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.740
implement the strategic goals of the

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.880
company, well, suppose, on the construction

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.760
of a new enterprise,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.420
the Engineering Department must

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.760
prepare drawings, justifications.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.820
The Department of Economics should

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.040
prepare a business plan.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.820
The HR department should

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.500
prepare the personnel for this

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.240
task.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.800
Provide the company with

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.520
the necessary human resources

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.560
needed for the realization

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.640
of these goals.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.160
And it is clear that each

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.500
department will get

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.340
its own KPI.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.040
They will all be different, but in general

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.860
they will, so to speak, hit the same point

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.620
– this is the KPI of corporations.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.580
But there are smaller units in

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.780
each department, say, departments,

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.620
and each department will also

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.440
get its own KPI.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.240
For example, in the ACR department

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.360
we have a department that is

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.680
engaged in recruitment.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:57.380
So, the KPI of this division will include

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:01.600
the search, study, selection and hiring

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.240
of personnel that are necessary for the

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.560
implementation of this project.

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.920
Well, let's remember now that

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.540
there are individual employees

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.060
in each unit, and each

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.360
of them will also

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.040
be given his own boil.

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.500
Here is such a beautiful system

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.580
that seeks all the plans of our huge

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.800
enterprise from top to bottom.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.300
is enchanting?

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.280
Yes very much.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.780
Just let us remember that this is a

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.480
huge job that requires not only the

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.760
introduction of new information

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.660
systems, but also the revision

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.720
of how our company worked before,

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.620
and the revision of proper positions,

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.780
and the revision of people's

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.720
attitudes to their work.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.960
Now let's remember one small

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.380
unpleasant feature.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.320
Tell me, please, how would it be easier

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.340
for you to work?

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.980
When are you just working and doing something?

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.760
Or when you have absolutely clear,

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.980
understandable norms, goals and goals?

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.020
Someone will say the second, and

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.500
those who have been in the first

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.900
mode will say, “No, why do I need

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.200
it, I was good before.”

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.240
Again, every implementation of such

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.340
a system in an organization meets

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.660
with tremendous resistance

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.680
from the staff, as does any major

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.760
innovation.

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.200
We have started to implement the KPI system

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.560
in our organization.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.260
How long do you think this implementation

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.920
will take?

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.400
I will say years.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.480
What resources will it require?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.200
the corresponding ones.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.760
What result will we get?

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.820
Results are not guaranteed.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.860
Maybe not to go out.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.080
Therefore, let's say so, the implementation

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.040
of KPI is a very noble thing.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.020
In terms of the managable system

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.660
these are attractive for

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.840
including labor costs and

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.060
other things, you need to think

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.480
very well.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.260
I must say that to my deepest

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.980
regret, I know about a dozen and

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.580
a half companies where this system

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.940
is implemented, works or

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.260
does not work, of them

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.340
only two are reliably understandable,

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.080
it is known that it is yes,

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.540
it really works, yes, it really

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.280
brings its results, but

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.860
unfortunately, I must say

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.980
that this is not our organization.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.800
I will not name them so that I will not make

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.160
any advertisements for anyone.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.840
These are representatives of

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.560
all known major international

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.660
trademarks.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.340
And this system was created,

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.820
of course, not here and not by these

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.180
resources, but within the framework

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.600
of the entire transnational

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.500
corporation that can afford

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.160
to spend such funds.

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.220
So, on the one hand, I would like

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.300
to have such a system, but it is

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.700
worth thinking whether it is not

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.660
enough to limit ourselves to

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.580
just a management system or another

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.720
system of evaluation of personnel

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.840
relevant to our task.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.800
The next technology of personnel

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.780
assessment that we would like to

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.680
discuss is the technology of

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.600
so-called expert assessments.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.300
As we said, this technology

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.560
is a bit of a mansion.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.080
It is specialized in both the methods

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.240
used and the purposes and the

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.160
way it is implemented.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.940
And above all, it differs in the fact

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.940
that the assessment is not conducted

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.480
by the employees of the organization

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.320
or the managers of our assessed employee,

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.520
but by completely outsiders

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.480
who don't know him at all.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.380
Who are these people?

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.740
These are the experts.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.040
What are they experts on?

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.880
It may not be so much in business,

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.380
it may not be so much in economics,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.240
it may not be so much in solving

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.980
certain specific business tasks,

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.680
but in assessing the most diverse

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.280
competences of a person,

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.940
which is required to perform

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.000
a particular job in

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.240
a particular position,

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.040
usually high.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.500
Note that unlike other assessment

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.720
methods, the technology of the expert

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.300
assessment center is often used

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.620
not only when evaluating the company's

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.220
current staff, but also when

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.640
evaluating potential employees,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.660
especially for high positions.

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.840
And some people in the West,

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.080
in the United States in particular,

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.760
turn to the Expert Assessment

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.120
Center to get a characterization

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.880
of their competence, and then

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.580
send it to various employers

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.540
with an offer of such

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.700
a wonderful person to take

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.700
on his job.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.720
Such practice also exists.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.540
But again, it is clear that this

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.540
is very cheap.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.560
If you pay attention, I have

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.000
allowed a word of reservation.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.080
I said they do not go to the Expert

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:44.980
Assessment Center.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.920
I said, he is addressing the expert

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.260
assessment center.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.660
The fact is that when we hear the

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.220
expression “expert assessment

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.920
center”, we imagine that there

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.820
is a house, there is a room in

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.540
the house, and it is written “center”.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.020
In fact, the center is not a place,

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.320
it is a procedure that can be carried

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.880
out anywhere, including, please,

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.500
if you are so comfortable, and

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.780
on the basis of your company.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.980
What is an expert assessment

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.740
center?

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.320
This is a procedure that is implemented

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.620
by an expert group.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.880
This is a set of tests, tasks, cases,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.620
practical exercises, based on which

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:25.580
conclusions are made about what

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.960
competencies our evaluated

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.080
person has, which are developed,

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.680
and which are not developed

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.220
or less developed.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.180
A so-called competence matrix

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.680
is created, which corresponds

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.380
to the competences of

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.540
the position in which

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.800
we consider our hero.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.720
On the basis of the performance of

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.320
various tasks, where the main role is

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.120
played by the solution of practical

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.100
tasks, the resolution of

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.500
cases, the so-called profile

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.120
of competence of the assessment of

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.780
my face is made, and then on the

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.700
basis of this profile, in fact, a

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.140
conclusion is given on what he

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.600
is capable of, and what,, not very

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.460
capable of.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.060
What are the experts who

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.400
make this assessment?

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.960
First of all, they must, on

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.700
the basis of observations of human

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.020
behavior, on the basis of assessments

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.040
of the tasks that he decides,

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.400
decide how much these competences

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.580
are developed.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.080
But for this, agree, you

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.520
need to have certain experience,

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.360
preparation.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.380
They are, to say the most clearly, special people.

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.400
There is another variant of the expert

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.280
assessment center, which is

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.360
called the “Development Center”,

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.340
the main task of which is not so

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.360
much to evaluate a person, but to

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.440
understand exactly what he lacks.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.820
That is, it is a methodology, it is

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.420
a technology, or more precisely, forgive

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.900
me, which solves the task of assessing

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.840
the need for development.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.920
Why do these technologies exist, why

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.320
do they need, and why can't we limit

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320
ourselves to simpler and cheaper

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
technologies?

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.460
Well, first of all, it is believed that

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.320
any technology of assessment of personnel

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.800
on the basis of the organization

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.460
itself, especially with the

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.700
involvement of its direct manager,

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.940
always carries a certain element

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:15.080
of subjectivity.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.820
Someone likes someone, someone doesn't

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:17.780
like someone.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.560
Someone got into a fight with someone, someone

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.140
got up with someone, so to speak, on the way.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.480
And, as is often the case, managers

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.620
underestimate their subordinates

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.240
simply because they are

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.060
afraid to create competitors.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.940
And the simplest option.

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.560
If we have assessment experts,

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.320
who will guarantee that

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.280
our employees are such experts?

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.500
No one guarantees.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.300
No one taught them to evaluate the staff.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.900
This is our task with you.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.440
What to decide, we will talk later.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.720
So, is the expert assessment considered

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.720
free of these shortcomings?

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.980
Is it objective?

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.000
Well, I honestly always have a question,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.400
and how do we guarantee that

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.560
the assessments that the center

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.320
has given are necessary to perform

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.960
the work we are recruiting for,

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.480
or the capabilities of

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.500
the person we are assessing

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.420
with you?

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.580
Well, in general, this is a very strong statement.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.220
Before creating a competence

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.960
matrix, before understanding

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.220
what competences a person

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.180
should have, it is also necessary

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.820
to do a big and serious job.

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.040
There is another disadvantage and another

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.940
problem with this technology.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.880
It works relatively well in those conditions

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.340
when business is well-established, management

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.160
is well-established, understandable.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.080
And the task of a person is rather

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.340
to take a place in a mechanism, and the

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:47.240
requirements for this place are known and

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.020
prescribed.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.320
It is so.

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.100
For those corporations that exist

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.580
and operate in the market for fifty years.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.400
I am afraid that not every

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.600
company meets these requirements.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.580


01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.740
Well, as a technology, I repeat,

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.660
it's a pretty expensive thing.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.360
Should we resort to her?

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.100
Let's see what goals we pursue

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:10.980
with you.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.680
And can we not assess the suitability

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.400
of our specialist to work

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.880
on the basis of simpler factors?

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.500
If not, let's try.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.060
In general, Center Expert Assessments

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.580
is an interesting, romantic

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.100
and developing activity.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.680
It takes from one to

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.280
several days.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.980
Again, the company image.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.580
We select people for top management

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.380
positions through

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.700
expert assessments.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.620
The only thing to pay attention

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.620
to here.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.500
Before you use expert assessments,

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.860
please ask your

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.300
experts for a portfolio.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.820
What organizations they have

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.980
already served, what has been done there,

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.260
and maybe not very well done.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.040
Otherwise, be very careful about

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.400
how to choose our respected

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.520
experts.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.000
The following assessment technologies

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.580
we will consider with you are a circular

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.580
assessment or a 360-degree assessment.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.500
This is the technology of evaluation

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.260
of personnel, where, as we have already

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.020
said, the managers, the person being

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.480
evaluated, that is, the evaluation from

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.460
above, internal customers and

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.720
suppliers, that is, colleagues,

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.920
associates, partners of our

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.660
person being evaluated,

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.780
its subordinates, possibly, and

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.160
often, self-evaluation is made, well

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.320
and also, if necessary,

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.120
if possible, if it really makes

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.540
sense, external clients

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.280
are attracted.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.440
They can be involved if our employee

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.060
works, well, say, in the back office

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.980
and people outside the organization

01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.980
on the job is almost not encountered.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.380
What's good about this assessment?

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.600
Of course, it is diverse.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.680
This will reduce the potential

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.360
subjectivism.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.140
What reduces the effectiveness of this assessment?

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.260
The fact is that, as I have

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.720
said, it takes a lot of

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:10.960
time and resources to

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.640
implement it, and this assessment

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.160
can meet quite serious

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.720
resistance from the parties

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.220
involved.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.500
Imagine that you are approached

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.760
and asked to give an

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.580
assessment of the person

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.880
you are working side by side

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.400
with.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.220
And if he doesn't have a very high

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.320
opinion, you might be afraid to just ruin

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.360
the relationship.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.520
And how to attract to the evaluation

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.440
of the subordinates of our respected

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.720
employee, if they have them?

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.780
Imagine that he has not received

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.180
very high appreciation from his

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.060
subordinates.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.120
And why?

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.240
And because he may not be a very

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.600
good manager, and maybe the

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.940
opposite, because he is just

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.520
a tough manager who makes unpopular

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.220
decisions, acts in the interests

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.060
of the company, so to

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.380
speak, and has a strong tail

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.560
to some of his subordinates.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.460


01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.200
No longer understandable.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.580
And if our manager has gotten

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.260
very high ratings from his

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.940
subordinates or average ratings,

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.820
what can that mean?

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.280
Both that he is good or average,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.480
and that people are afraid to spoil

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.840
a relationship and then get

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.880
theirs for such not very good

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.160
ratings.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.920
There is a third important

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.540
point, which concerns

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.220
our domestic mentality.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.420
The fact is that we do not have a very

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.580
democratic system of governance,

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.080
which is clear from where it came, it

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.760
is clear from where we have such

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.740
traditions.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.080
And for many leaders, the very idea

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.320
that subordinates will be

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.060
involved in evaluating their

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.740
superiors is a stupid threat.

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:42.480
How is it?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.020
The boss is always more correct,

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.340
more right and smarter.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.520
You can say so, and you can say otherwise.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.960
For example, I think that if managers

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.680
are afraid of their subordinates'

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.820
assessments, then they probably

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.600
aren't very competent

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.860
managers.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.940
In other words, a 360-degree assessment

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.980
system works well where there is

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.040
a fairly democratic management

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.340
culture, where there is open

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.980
communication, where there are,

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.460
for example, situations where

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.200
managers are absolutely

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.940
not afraid of assessments from

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.040
their subordinates because

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.240
they know they will be adequate,

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.260
or, on the contrary, they perceive

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.700
such assessments as guidance

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.860
to action.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.840
In such situations, of course, this

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.120
assessment works well.

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.540
Let's see what she can

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.700
give us.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.240
In the following graph, we see

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.780
an example of the 360-degree assessment

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.400
that a employee was given by his

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.100
boss, his peers, that is, colleagues

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:45.040
and his self-esteem.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.080
The assessments were given on parameters

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.560
of inclination to cooperation,

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.300
cooperativity, energeticity, initiative,

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.320
communication and creativity.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.120
I will not say why you took

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.680
these and I will not

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.580
say how we assessed them.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.500
This issue will be discussed in detail

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.560
in the next section, which deals

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.820
with personnel assessment methods.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.860
Let's look at the graphs

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.680
we are watching here.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.960
See also.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.080
Self-esteem is above the

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.880
assessments given to

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.520
our hero, his manager,

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.880
his colleagues.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.840
This already raises interesting questions.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.720
Where are the biggest differences?

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.920
First of all, in the position

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:38.140
of cooperation, where self-esteem is

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.320
almost the highest possible, and from the

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.540
side of a colleague is so average,

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.060
and from the side of communications,

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.700
where again a person has put a fairly

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.820
high appreciation for himself,

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:53.340
and colleagues have a middle point.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.360
What do you think can

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.140
explain this situation?

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.380
A careful analysis of this chart causes

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.640
the hypothesis that a person

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640
suffers from somewhat overestimated

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.100
self-esteem.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.240
That, most likely, he is not

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.420
as focused on cooperation as he

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.360
thinks, and does not perceive

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.120
him and understand his colleagues

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.220
as he thinks.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.020
And, most likely, in this regard,

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.340
it has deficits.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.940
But pay attention to the coincidence

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.220
of opinions about the creativity and

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:30.060
energy of our character from the

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.180
point of view of him and his cowboy.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.840
The assessment is the same.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.760
How do you see yourself this man?

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.640
In general, it is quite easy to imagine.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.580
He is an energetic, purpose-

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.220
oriented, ideas-guying person

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.600
who may possess leadership

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.400
qualities, but in order to

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.640
fully realize himself as

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.540
a leader or leader, he still

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.740
has to work on himself

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:51.680
very well.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.220
This is just an example.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.000


01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.750


01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.830
It shows to what extent an interesting

01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:59.970
and detailed assessment of a person

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:03.270
can be made by this 360-degree assessment

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.350
technology.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:07.050
We only have to confirm our hypotheses

01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.330
with the help of more subtle technologies,

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.830
but you see it hard done, it's

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.150
hard done and it's unlikely

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:16.090
it makes sense to conduct

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:18.710
such an assessment if we have

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:20.710
a lot of staff to assess.

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:23.450
I think that the company is

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:24.990
able to withstand the

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.010
use of this technology on labor

01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:28.230
costs if the estimates

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.570
move 15-20 people, but not more.

01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:34.770
But it is worth repeating once again

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:37.430
that, unfortunately, it is very

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:40.750
likely that if the company's organizational

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.710
culture, its traditions, manners

01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:45.810
and leadership do not fully

01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:49.170
meet the democratic requirements

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.190
that are necessary to implement

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:52.190
the 360-degree assessment

01:21:52.190 --> 01:21:54.730
technology.

01:21:54.850 --> 01:21:56.570
This is where we end the second

01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:59.130
part of our lesson, devoted to assessment

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:00.490
technologies.

01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:03.870
I will ask you to read again,

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:06.110
to carefully review the outputs of

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:08.230
this part of our class, and also

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:09.810
to answer the questions from

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.990
your workbook, part 2.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:13.730
I hope they won't cause

01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:14.530
you any trouble.

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.590
The foundation loves you!
