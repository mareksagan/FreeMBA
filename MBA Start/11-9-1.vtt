00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Elena Konstantinovna Panteleeva, and I am a lecturer at the Marketing Department at the School of Economics.

00:14.000 --> 00:37.000
I deal with issues and problems such as the international marketing and branding of companies in the foreign market. I have experience teaching at business schools such as the School of Management, the School of Marketing and Business Development, and I also deal with consulting.

00:38.000 --> 00:57.000
The topic of our conversation today is international marketing. Japanese wisdom says, if I am negotiating with you, I will speak your language. If I buy goods from you, you must speak my language.

00:57.000 --> 01:19.000
In fact, this Japanese wisdom reflects the philosophy of international marketing. It is very difficult to understand and satisfy the needs of foreign consumers, especially if we are not sure what the needs are.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
We will have to find out what the needs are or create something that will be interesting to foreign consumers.

01:28.000 --> 01:51.000
If we recall companies such as Sony, Coca-Cola, Nestle, and a huge number of other well-known companies that represent their products in a huge number of markets, they somehow learned to speak the same language as foreign consumers.

01:51.000 --> 02:08.000
Therefore, the central question of our conversation today is whether Russian companies can learn to speak the same language as foreign consumers and achieve real success in the global market.

02:08.000 --> 02:29.000
Today, we cannot talk seriously about the long-term life of a business if it is focused solely on the domestic market. Or let's talk about a situation when a company is very successful in the domestic market, but is not present in the global market.

02:29.000 --> 02:58.000
What can help us win foreign markets? The experience of winning regions is of great importance. Russian companies are in a winning situation because they are forced to face new rules of the game and new consumers.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
In this sense, success in the regional markets may not be the main reason for success in the international markets.

03:08.000 --> 03:24.000
Let's be honest. Winning international markets is a very difficult task. It will require a lot of effort and a lot of costs from your company.

03:24.000 --> 03:50.000
If all this is done properly, the costs and efforts will be paid off. According to the Small Business Development Corporation, the productivity of exporting firms is 20% higher than that of firms focused solely on the domestic market.

03:51.000 --> 04:07.000
At the same time, the probability of bankruptcy of exporters is 9% lower than that of firms that do not export. And finally, exporting firms usually react much faster to changes in the market economy.

04:07.000 --> 04:26.000
All this leads us to what we will be doing today. Our main questions will be the following. We will try to understand the motives and risks of a company's exit to the foreign market.

04:26.000 --> 04:40.000
The next aspect we will consider is the stages of the company's involvement in international business. I would also like to share a very useful thing with you.

04:40.000 --> 04:58.000
This is the experience of companies from countries with developing economies, the so-called emerging markets, and the comparison of problems and opportunities for international expansion of these companies and Russian companies.

04:58.000 --> 05:21.000
And then we will move on to the more instrumental part. We will see how to choose markets for international expansion, how to compare possible models of exit to the foreign market, and finally, how to formulate and implement the choice of international marketing strategy. Let's start with the content of our course.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
There's probably an interesting thing out there.

05:51.000 --> 06:04.000
The first step is to learn the high science on your own market, then you can look at the international market.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
In the traditional logic, companies start by trying to keep the consumer.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
They increase the degree of keeping the customer.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
This is the first step.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
Then you will move to increase the share of the company in consumer expenses.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
If you succeed, you will move to the next level of attracting new consumers.

06:34.000 --> 06:46.000
I urge you not to forget that each previous step is the basis for the next one.

06:46.000 --> 06:57.000
This is where the money flows are generated, which will allow you to finance the growth along this ladder.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
We move on.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
The development of new goods and services, the exit to new markets, but we are still talking about the domestic market.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
These can be new segments.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
The next step is new channels of goods and services.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And finally, what we are talking about.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
International growth.

07:18.000 --> 07:31.000
When all the opportunities of the domestic market are exhausted, you start looking for further growth outside the domestic market.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
This is the traditional logic.

07:34.000 --> 07:51.000
The question is, how do you think, is it possible to jump out of this logic and become successful in foreign markets without trying to create strong positions in the domestic market?

07:52.000 --> 08:07.000
Let's look at the trends that affect international business and will help us to answer the question I just raised.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Let's see what these trends are.

08:11.000 --> 08:25.000
The first trend that everyone is talking about, both practitioners and people with academic careers, is the strengthening of globalization and regionalization processes.

08:25.000 --> 08:34.000
We hear a lot about the strengthening of globalization processes.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
But this is due to the rapid development of information and communication technologies.

08:44.000 --> 08:55.000
If we look at the development of the economy, we should talk about regionalization processes.

08:56.000 --> 09:15.000
Many studies show that if we analyze the statistics of foreign trade, the strengthening of trade processes is not happening on a global scale, but within certain regions.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
I deliberately give two interpretations here.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Globalization and regionalization processes.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
But how interesting can this be from the point of view of Russian companies?

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
What else are we dealing with in the framework of this process?

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
The first thing we see is the reduction of barriers to international activity.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
What is called trade liberalization.

09:45.000 --> 09:56.000
But on the one hand, there is a serious reduction in market protection.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
And yet, there is a very serious influence of non-tariff barriers.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
On the one hand, this simplifies the implementation of business operations.

10:13.000 --> 10:21.000
On the other hand, such a serious simplification of activity in foreign markets does not give us this yet.

10:21.000 --> 10:31.000
The next aspect of this globalization process is expressed in the strengthening of competition.

10:31.000 --> 10:42.000
Because we are now seeing a colossal flow of new players from developing countries.

10:42.000 --> 10:55.000
Even if you look at the data, almost all media are talking about companies from BRIC countries.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
The first letters are Brazil, Russia, India, China.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
And this is the new force that we have to reckon with.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
And finally, the third important aspect is the change in consumer expectations.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
After all, the consumer in almost every country in the world already has a huge choice.

11:20.000 --> 11:31.000
And he can choose from local products, products of regional manufacturers and global manufacturers.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
And, accordingly, his appetites are increasing.

11:35.000 --> 11:45.000
He already has the opportunity to compare what his companies, local companies and international companies offer him.

11:46.000 --> 12:03.000
And all this leads to the fact that if you are not able to exceed, I emphasize, not even satisfy, but exceed the expectations of foreign consumers,

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
it will be quite difficult for you to win in the competitive struggle of international companies.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Our next trend is the rapid development of information and communication technologies.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
What does it give us? What is it interesting about?

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
The first, certainly interesting thing is the emergence of the intranet.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
What do I mean here?

12:25.000 --> 12:36.000
For us, for Russian companies in particular, it gives the opportunity for easier communication within the company.

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
Which, in turn, will allow us to accelerate the process of, say, the development of new goods, exchange of ideas, etc.

12:46.000 --> 12:54.000
And the like, which will ultimately lead to a faster commercialization of your ideas, your goods.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
And the world is now more and more subject to the word speed.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And this should be taken into account.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
The next aspect is the internet, of course.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
And what does the internet give companies to conquer international markets?

13:12.000 --> 13:30.000
In fact, it gives direct access to the consumer on any market, whether it is Brazil, whether it is Russia, whether it is India or any other country where the internet is already, let's say, sufficiently developed.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
The next aspect is the change in the nature of marketing.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes, it is largely due to the emergence of these very new technologies.

13:40.000 --> 13:53.000
And, accordingly, for companies that belong to the so-called new industries, these are industries that are based on information and knowledge.

13:54.000 --> 14:04.000
For such companies, the nature of marketing has changed due to the fact that you have direct access to your end consumer.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
And you no longer need intermediaries.

14:08.000 --> 14:19.000
On the other hand, if we look at traditional industries, in this case, I mean industries where there is a established technology.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
What is more typical for these industries?

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
In this situation, it is more typical for the gradual transfer of production to less developed countries.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
At the same time, prices are falling, the margin is shrinking.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
The next trend we should mention is the emergence of the knowledge economy.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
That is, everything related to the growth of spending on neocor, the reduction of the life cycle of goods.

14:50.000 --> 15:01.000
This is what requires companies to be constantly on the wave of innovations that are happening in business.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
In that case, if you do not keep up with what is happening in business, this wave washes you away.

15:09.000 --> 15:20.000
And finally, the emergence of new organizational forms, such as network forms of inter-company cooperation, virtual enterprises, clusters.

15:20.000 --> 15:37.000
All this significantly facilitates the process of exchange of ideas, experience, and so on, which ultimately allows you to reduce your costs and accelerate the pace of commercialization of goods.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
Now let's talk about what makes companies move to the international market.

15:44.000 --> 15:53.000
There are some motives that are an active aspiration of companies, and there are so-called reactive motives.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
This is actually what forces companies to move to the foreign market.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
The most common active motive is the desire to increase profits and growth rates.

16:08.000 --> 16:24.000
It should be said that 88% of new companies are companies from countries with developing economies with revenues of more than a billion dollars.

16:24.000 --> 16:37.000
88% of these companies say that they go to the international market to gain growth and increase profits.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
But for us, perhaps, another motive is more relevant.

16:44.000 --> 17:00.000
It may seem strange, but if the ambitions of your company's managers are high enough, this is a significant step towards success in the international market.

17:00.000 --> 17:17.000
In general, probably, in any market. If you are confident, if you know that your product or service is really high quality, you can interest anyone with this product or service.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
The next active motive is the presence of technological competencies or a unique product.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Here I would like to say a few words about Abbe.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Probably, you are all well aware of such a product as FineReader.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
Indeed, this is the product with which the company has managed to conquer the international market.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
This is a software product that allows you to recognize texts.

17:46.000 --> 17:55.000
The company is selling this product successfully in the foreign markets, but it does not stop at what it has achieved.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
Now it is actively trying to use the opportunity that has arisen in the foreign markets.

18:02.000 --> 18:14.000
In connection with the well-known geopolitical factors, Arab countries are now getting significant attention and interest.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
Nevertheless, there is still no software product that would allow you to reliably recognize Arab connections.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
The company is now actively working on this.

18:26.000 --> 18:35.000
This smoothly leads us to the next active motive, which is the use of opportunities in the international markets.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Here is another good example.

18:39.000 --> 18:55.000
Russian food companies, such as Karkunov, Ochakov, etc., used a simple opportunity.

18:55.000 --> 19:07.000
This is the service of the immigrant segment, the use of the most nostalgic motives, which are quite typical for this environment,

19:07.000 --> 19:20.000
and the penetration into even developed and very serious competitive markets, such as the United States of America, Germany, Israel, etc.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
The next active motive is the saving of the scale.

19:24.000 --> 19:38.000
This allows you to reduce production costs, so you can set lower prices and feel completely calm in the competition,

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
if price competition begins in the markets.

19:43.000 --> 20:01.000
Finally, there is the motive of tax benefits, state stimulus for export, but this is a motive that is not always used.

20:01.000 --> 20:12.000
If we look at the reactive motives, the most unpleasant is the small size or saturation of the domestic market.

20:12.000 --> 20:30.000
For Russian companies, the near future may not be easy, because according to demographic data, by 2050, the population of Russia will be reduced by a third,

20:30.000 --> 20:39.000
which means that the domestic market will shrink, so companies can look for opportunities in foreign markets.

20:39.000 --> 20:50.000
For example, a company that was based on this logic in the foreign market is Mir, which produces park rides.

20:50.000 --> 21:01.000
In the early 1990s, they faced the fact that state orders in this area ceased, and the domestic Russian market began to shrink.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
The company was forced to look for opportunities abroad.

21:06.000 --> 21:15.000
They began to visit various exhibitions and see what competitors offer there.

21:15.000 --> 21:26.000
It turned out that competitors bring catalogs with samples of their products.

21:27.000 --> 21:37.000
What could the Russian company offer in the market, which is a monopoly and the entry to which was very difficult?

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
The Russian company, as we are used to, played at the price.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
The fact is that Russian products were about twice cheaper than foreign analogues.

21:51.000 --> 22:01.000
At the same time, Russian specialists offered a unique opportunity to look at the samples.

22:01.000 --> 22:17.000
This gave potential customers the opportunity to come to Russia and try the construction of these rides on the spot,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
some additional opportunities, and so on.

22:21.000 --> 22:30.000
In fact, the company managed to penetrate both the European and Asian markets.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
The next asset is the pressure of competitors.

22:34.000 --> 22:50.000
Yes, there are situations when the competition in the domestic market is so strong that companies notice that the working conditions are becoming more and more difficult,

22:50.000 --> 23:07.000
that profits are falling, and in this situation companies begin to think about where there may be more opportunities to make profits.

23:07.000 --> 23:21.000
Therefore, sometimes Turkish companies leave their market for even more competitive markets, in particular Germany,

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
but there are more opportunities to make profits there.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
The next asset is the availability of excess production capacities.

23:34.000 --> 23:49.000
If you have excess capacity or resources in the domestic market, it will be very beneficial for you to load these capacities,

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
let's call it export volume, and then sell this product in foreign markets.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
Another reactive motive is the pursuit of traditional consumers.

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
In fact, this is perhaps the most common thing for companies operating in the B2B sphere.

24:10.000 --> 24:21.000
In this situation, if you are a supplier of Ford, Ford is represented in a huge number of markets,

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
and you are actually following Ford on the international market like a thread behind a needle.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
The next reactive motive is accidental export orders.

24:35.000 --> 24:44.000
Perhaps this is a fairly traditional thing for Russian companies in the early 1990s,

24:44.000 --> 24:52.000
when our companies were really striving for foreign markets, but still did not quite understand where, how and why.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
And by receiving such once-off orders, they had the opportunity to gain access to the international market.

25:00.000 --> 25:07.000
So far, let's call it unconscious, not direct, but indirect.

25:07.000 --> 25:21.000
Nevertheless, in the early 1990s, Metal Park received an order from a South Korean businessman to manufacture golf clubs.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
Moreover, the company had competencies in the field of processing such metals as, in particular, titanium.

25:29.000 --> 25:39.000
These heads were made of titanium, and such a once-off batch of export orders was made.

25:39.000 --> 25:53.000
After that, the company gained access to a very rich and attractive golf equipment market for some time.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
And finally, another reactive motive is the desire to expand the sale of seasonal goods.

26:01.000 --> 26:17.000
Of course, the world and, accordingly, the climate offer us opportunities associated with a very high fluctuation of temperatures, pressures, and so on.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
And this can become an additional opportunity for your product.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
Let's say you are a manufacturer of windsurfing equipment.

26:28.000 --> 26:40.000
It is clear that if you are a Norwegian manufacturer, then the season in your cold seas will most likely be quite short.

26:40.000 --> 26:50.000
And therefore, it is quite logical for such a company to look at, say, southern countries, where the season for windsurfing can be significantly extended.

26:50.000 --> 27:00.000
Everything would seem very beautiful, and there are serious reasons to move to the foreign market.

27:00.000 --> 27:10.000
But, alas, we must always remember that every coin has a flip side, and this side is the risk side.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Let's see what types of risks exist.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
We will divide them into four groups.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
The first is economic risk.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
The second is political risk.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
The third is behavioral risk.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
And finally, the fourth group is technological risk.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
Let's try to get a little bit into the essence of these types of risks.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
Let's start with the first group, economic risk.

27:41.000 --> 27:51.000
Of course, we all understand that the problem can be an economic and financial situation in the world.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
What is this connected with?

27:53.000 --> 28:08.000
Of course, this is connected with the fact that the influence of negative processes can affect the purchasing power of consumers, and, of course, this will affect your sales.

28:09.000 --> 28:25.000
Also, a negative situation in the currency markets can greatly affect the competitiveness of foreign goods on the local markets.

28:25.000 --> 28:38.000
In particular, we saw this in 1998, when almost immediately foreign goods became unrivaled in price on our market.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
And, accordingly, this should be taken into account by companies that are striving for foreign markets.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
Another type of risk here is tariff and non-tariff barriers.

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
As we have already said, the tariff protection of many markets has already been significantly reduced.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
But, unfortunately, the non-tariff protection of markets is increasing.

29:02.000 --> 29:16.000
Moreover, for Russian companies, this is just a bitch, because Russia is one of the ten countries that face the largest number of such barriers.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
As you understand, China is the first place here.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
Nevertheless, Russia and Russian companies lose a lot on this.

29:25.000 --> 29:34.000
Let's see how these mechanisms can weaken the competitiveness of your products.

29:34.000 --> 29:43.000
I want to give you an example of what happened to Japanese video tape recorders in France.

29:43.000 --> 29:55.000
The fact is that Japanese and French video tape recorders were on the French market in about the same price category.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
The quality was not very different.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
But the French government decided to protect the local manufacturer.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
What was done?

30:08.000 --> 30:22.000
In the past, Japanese video tape recorders were shipped to the French market by sea, which is a relatively cheap means of transportation.

30:22.000 --> 30:34.000
Then they were shipped to French ports, and then by car or railway transport to different parts of the country.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
What was done?

30:36.000 --> 30:48.000
Customs terminals were moved inland, and the nearest customs terminal was about 100 miles from the port.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
What happens in this situation?

30:51.000 --> 31:06.000
The manufacturer has an additional cost of transportation, which is related to the movement of cargo from the port to the customs terminal.

31:06.000 --> 31:23.000
As a result, the final prices for Japanese video tape recorders have increased, and consumers are paying more and more attention to their own French video tape recorders.

31:23.000 --> 31:33.000
As you can see, this is a very dangerous tool in the hands of governments of different countries, and we cannot influence it.

31:34.000 --> 31:53.000
The next aspects of economic risks are related to strong competition on international markets, and the need to adapt products to international market demands.

31:53.000 --> 32:05.000
This will increase the final price of your products and make them less competitive.

32:05.000 --> 32:26.000
The next block of risks is political risks. Companies have to face a lot of problems because this is a situation that you cannot influence, or your influence is very limited.

32:26.000 --> 32:42.000
What are we talking about? Political instability, which can be very dangerous if you invest in a market. You are at risk of not getting your investments back.

32:42.000 --> 32:57.000
Another very unpleasant aspect is bureaucratic barriers and corruption, because this can become an additional burden for you.

32:57.000 --> 33:21.000
Hong Kong companies have an interesting statistic. They say that when they start a business project in Russia, about 10-15% of the cost of the project goes to the account.

33:21.000 --> 33:32.000
In China, this amount is about 5%, and in Indonesia, such numbers can be up to 30%.

33:33.000 --> 33:54.000
What else is bad? If this is not an additional financial burden for you, then it is possible that these bureaucratic barriers will lead to your investment projects taking up more time than you expected.

33:54.000 --> 34:01.000
This is also a delay in entering the foreign market.

34:01.000 --> 34:22.000
Now let's pay attention to behavioral risks. This is something you can control to a large extent, because it checks your skills, your skills as a marketer, as a foreign consumer.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
What should we pay attention to? Of course, cultural and linguistic differences.

34:30.000 --> 34:45.000
All companies understand that when transferring their products to another cultural and linguistic environment, you must be extremely careful.

34:45.000 --> 34:56.000
But even such large companies as McDonald's or Coca-Cola sometimes forget about this and make mistakes.

34:56.000 --> 35:18.000
In particular, such a mistake was made by these companies when they conquered the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, McDonald's and Coca-Cola put the flag of Saudi Arabia on their packaging and put a phrase from the Koran on the back of the flag.

35:18.000 --> 35:42.000
But one very significant cultural feature was not taken into account. The fact is that in Islam it is forbidden to tear holy letters, but you put these holy letters on the packaging, which is not intended to be stored.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
Accordingly, the consumer simply did not buy the product that was packed in this way.

35:49.000 --> 35:59.000
Another problem that companies face, which did not pay enough attention to this, is linguistic problems.

35:59.000 --> 36:11.000
The most problematic points are the name of your brand and all advertising slogans and advertising materials.

36:11.000 --> 36:32.000
The strangest example is the Australian airline, which, entering the Hong Kong market, decided not to adapt its name to a foreign language environment.

36:33.000 --> 36:48.000
The company's management was surprised that no one wanted to buy tickets for this airline, and, accordingly, the company incurred losses.

36:48.000 --> 37:05.000
What was the matter? The fact was that in this very linguistic environment, the brand of the company sounded like a dead world. As you understand, it was a very bad advertising for an airline.

37:05.000 --> 37:20.000
Another peculiar example was related to advertising campaigns. This advertising was hanging in the Copenhagen airport for a long time.

37:20.000 --> 37:41.000
In Russian, it sounded like this. We will take your luggage and send it in any direction. This did not please the consumer, because he was wondering where and when he would see his luggage in the next country in the world.

37:41.000 --> 37:51.000
Therefore, companies need to be extremely careful. I repeat, this is your task, the task of marketers.

37:51.000 --> 38:13.000
The next task of marketers, and the risk associated with this, is the misunderstanding of the preferences of foreign consumers. In particular, in America, the classic marketing mistake is still considered by European cars, such as Mercedes.

38:13.000 --> 38:35.000
The fact is that when these cars first began to enter the American market, they did not contain a very important, but necessary for Americans detail, namely, cup holders. It would seem a trifle, but a trifle is very important.

38:36.000 --> 38:50.000
Finally, there is also a risk associated with a misunderstanding of the culture of business in other countries. Of course, this will be fundamentally important for you at the stage of negotiating.

38:50.000 --> 39:10.000
It is advisable to study the approaches and requirements for these features of the culture of business in other countries before negotiating with representatives of other countries.

39:10.000 --> 39:31.000
The next type of risk is technological risks. We see that companies like Sony and Microsoft are constantly trying to fight technological piracy, of course, because they are short of significant income due to the influence of this factor.

39:32.000 --> 39:52.000
But on the other hand, we have to remember that in the case when software does not work as it should, in these cases, the consumer often transfers all his negative feelings to the company's production.

39:52.000 --> 40:09.000
And thus it negatively affects the image of the brand. Therefore, technological piracy is a very serious risk, and companies operating in international markets are constantly trying to fight this phenomenon.

40:09.000 --> 40:35.000
The next technological risk is the underdevelopment of infrastructure. Here is a curious example of a company called Lever Brasus, which in India and Pakistan, in addition to countries with a hot climate, but at the same time not at the highest level of development,

40:35.000 --> 40:54.000
they faced the fact that by supplying their frozen products to these markets, such as various vegetable, berry and other mixes, they could not bring these frozen mixtures to the end consumer in the most ideal form.

40:54.000 --> 41:09.000
Why? Because, unfortunately, the wholesale retail system of these countries was poorly equipped with refrigerators, and therefore the products in this hot climate simply were not preserved.

41:09.000 --> 41:26.000
And so the company had to spend quite a lot of money to develop a new type of products for these markets, which were already dehydrated products that could be preserved in this hot climate for as long as possible.

41:26.000 --> 41:45.000
And now I would like to offer you a small task. Try to make a list of risks that your company will face when it enters the foreign market. And try to arrange them in terms of significance.

41:45.000 --> 42:01.000
In fact, this is a very useful task before entering the foreign market, so that you can understand where problems may arise. At least for some of them, you will prepare in this way.

42:16.000 --> 42:35.000
The next aspect that I would like to draw your attention to is how companies work in international markets, what strategies they use. And I suggest you pay attention to the slide of international business strategies.

42:35.000 --> 42:52.000
Here, in this matrix, as you can see, there are four types of strategies. Snail strategy, multilocal strategy, transnational strategy, and global strategy. How did we divide them into cells in this matrix?

42:52.000 --> 43:14.000
On the one hand, we take into account the degree of global integration, and on the other hand, we take into account the sensitivity of the company to the conditions of the local market. And based on these two components, we can determine which strategy is more difficult for a particular company.

43:14.000 --> 43:34.000
Let's pay attention to the first type of strategy, the snail strategy. What happens in this case? In this case, the company relies entirely on its core competencies, which were developed for and for its local market.

43:34.000 --> 43:58.000
And these competencies serve as a weapon, a competitive tool in international markets. An example here is a cement industry, a company that operates in this logic. They are like a snail, pulling this house behind them to other foreign markets.

43:58.000 --> 44:22.000
The next type of strategy differs from the first one in that you begin to react very clearly to the conditions of foreign markets. You begin to understand that each international market is unique, and accordingly, marketing strategies are developed for each market.

44:22.000 --> 44:37.000
The main source of competitive advantage is adaptation to the conditions of the local market. On the one hand, this is very good, because you satisfy the requirements of foreign consumers to the fullest.

44:37.000 --> 44:55.000
On the other hand, the costs are increasing enormously. And another unpleasant aspect is the loss of coordination between the markets, between the activities of the companies that are carried out in a number of foreign markets.

44:55.000 --> 45:14.000
What companies follow this logic? Ten years ago, I would say that Unilever follows this strategy. Now we will see that the company is already migrating towards a transnational strategy.

45:14.000 --> 45:28.000
If we look at who still follows this logic, we can probably name Heinz, which still tries to adapt its products to the conditions of local markets.

45:44.000 --> 46:11.000
In this case, you get benefits from efficiency on a global scale, but at the same time you keep your attention to local features.

46:11.000 --> 46:36.000
This is what the Unilever strategy describes. It uses features on local markets, taking into account the changes in tastes that contribute to the adoption of products on foreign markets.

46:36.000 --> 46:52.000
The price varies, the communication varies, but the basis is a certain concept that allows the company to be accessible and, most importantly, to reduce its costs.

46:52.000 --> 47:12.000
It should also be noted that such behavior of companies on international markets gave rise to the term globalization and localization. This is a situation where you strive to combine seemingly impossible things.

47:12.000 --> 47:32.000
And finally, the global strategy, when you refuse to take into account the differences between markets. You say that the basis of your competitive advantage is efficiency on a global scale.

47:32.000 --> 47:54.000
You adjust your activity on international markets to offer the consumer a standardized product at acceptable prices, but the basis is a single concept, a single positioning.

47:54.000 --> 48:14.000
This increases your recognition on global and international markets, and on the other hand, it allows you to be more effective. In particular, such companies as Ikea or Body Shop are a good example.

48:14.000 --> 48:33.000
Now let's try to figure out which ways lead to the global market, what opportunities companies have. The first opportunity is the possibility of gradual, consistent entry into the global market.

48:33.000 --> 48:56.000
Of course, this is a long-term strategy, and it often takes years or even decades.

48:56.000 --> 49:19.000
In the past, when there was no Internet, information and communication technologies were not so developed, such companies as Kodak, Ford, Nestle, Unilever, and so on, these companies spent years and years to conquer the global market.

49:19.000 --> 49:38.000
Now we see that such a consistent path is more typical for companies operating in traditional industries. Companies operating in so-called new industries are more typical for them in the second way, which is to jump into the global market.

49:38.000 --> 50:06.000
These companies can become global players very quickly, and such an entry into the international market and the conquest of strong positions takes a very short time, up to three years, sometimes even six months.

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
This is a phenomenon that has been called born global in recent years.

50:36.000 --> 50:51.000
This can be the formation of networks or clusters that will allow you to enter the global market using each other's resources gradually, but still much faster than in the first case.

50:51.000 --> 51:12.000
This option can be quite fast if you can find an interesting large manufacturer that wants to get your product as a component of its final product.

51:13.000 --> 51:20.000
And you can prove this with quality, and stable quality. Not only high, but also stable.

51:20.000 --> 51:30.000
Let's now try to look at these three options of entering the global market in a little more detail.

51:30.000 --> 51:43.000
So, the first option is to enter the global market, this is the longest path, and this path traditionally goes through a number of stages.

51:43.000 --> 51:56.000
The first stage is the preparatory stage, when your company may not have any export activity at all, you are solely focused on the domestic market.

51:56.000 --> 52:08.000
But in this situation, you can already start considering the opportunities of entering the foreign market, assessing these opportunities and gaining experience.

52:08.000 --> 52:17.000
At this stage, companies receive the most experience from possible partners, but on the domestic market.

52:18.000 --> 52:28.000
What do I mean? You can carry out import activities, or you can create joint enterprises, but for now on your domestic market.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
So, for now, we are focusing on the domestic market.

52:33.000 --> 52:43.000
An example of a company that has been at this stage for a long time is the Taiwanese computer company Acer.

52:43.000 --> 52:54.000
The company was founded in 1976, but I must say that before the early 1980s, they did not have their own product at all.

52:54.000 --> 53:04.000
The company was exclusively engaged in distribution and was a distributor of such companies as Texas Instruments.

53:05.000 --> 53:16.000
But I repeat, they did not have a product, but there was a great desire to become a company that was present on the international markets.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.000
And when the product appeared, the company began to actively enter the global market.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
The second stage is the initial entry into the market.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
In fact, you are still maintaining your orientation to the domestic market.

53:32.000 --> 53:42.000
It is about the fact that the share of export in your operations is up to 10% of the total sales volume.

53:42.000 --> 53:57.000
But at this stage, you are already gradually expanding the volume of export, and maybe as one of the steps you will take to create your own trading company abroad.

53:57.000 --> 54:07.000
In fact, at this stage, you are starting to create outposts on foreign markets, or maybe on one foreign market.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
The next stage is the expansion of the local market.

54:11.000 --> 54:23.000
Here you are actually pushing a local market to which you have entered at the previous step.

54:23.000 --> 54:31.000
At the same time, a marketing strategy is already being developed for this market.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
At this stage, companies often resort to making direct foreign investments.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
This can be, say, buying assets abroad.

54:44.000 --> 55:02.000
In particular, we saw a similar picture in 1994, when Unilever, which was present on the Russian market only through export, purchased the North Light factory and began to produce Sansilk shampoo there.

55:02.000 --> 55:12.000
Now, as you probably know, this factory produces both deodorants and washing liquids, and so on.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
That is, the company is already actively expanding the local market.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
And finally, the fourth stage is global rationalization.

55:20.000 --> 55:29.000
At this stage, companies are already moving from national orientation to global orientation.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
What does this mean?

55:31.000 --> 55:40.000
This means that you coordinate and integrate your activity in the countries where you entered at the previous stages.

55:40.000 --> 55:47.000
This allows you to solve the problems that may have arisen at the previous stage.

55:47.000 --> 55:54.000
The problems we talked about are duplication of efforts, significant increase in costs.

55:54.000 --> 56:05.000
At this stage of global rationalization, you try to balance all this so that you can achieve efficiency on a global scale.

56:06.000 --> 56:19.000
Companies like Ford have already successfully reached this stage and are carrying out their activities in coordination with their international operations.

56:19.000 --> 56:27.000
In particular, one of the elements that Ford uses is the so-called Ford Performance Center.

56:27.000 --> 56:39.000
It is quite curious that the company has placed a number of such centers that bring together engineers, designers,

56:39.000 --> 56:50.000
who develop certain common standards, common designs, which are later used as a standard, a standard,

56:50.000 --> 57:01.000
or a basis on which some changes can be made, some adaptation to the local market.

57:01.000 --> 57:11.000
But the basis is a certain standard, let's agree on the standard of these solutions.

57:12.000 --> 57:21.000
The next type of our global market is a phenomenon born globally.

57:21.000 --> 57:30.000
What is it? These are companies that can become players on the global market almost instantly.

57:30.000 --> 57:37.000
At the same time, if we saw that in the previous situation companies go through a number of successive stages,

57:37.000 --> 57:45.000
then these companies become global, often jumping over some stages.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
And I must say that these companies do not start with the fact that they win strong positions on the domestic market.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
They are directly oriented to the global market.

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
This is actually what is embedded in the name of this phenomenon, born globally.

58:05.000 --> 58:14.000
What companies can we call the typical representatives of this class of companies?

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
First of all, these are companies in the high-tech sphere.

58:19.000 --> 58:28.000
Companies like Stone Soft, F-Secure are Finnish companies born globally,

58:28.000 --> 58:38.000
who in a very short period of time, from about a year to three, managed to win very serious positions on the global market.

58:38.000 --> 58:47.000
Moreover, the coverage of international markets of these companies is about 80 countries.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
So, we can say that they are globally present.

58:52.000 --> 59:00.000
Another example is Amazon, which managed to become globally present quite quickly.

59:00.000 --> 59:08.000
But there is also a slightly different type of companies, typical representatives, these are so-called craftsmen.

59:09.000 --> 59:23.000
Here we can give an example of Scottish companies, which specialize in the production of jewelry using Celtic design,

59:23.000 --> 59:33.000
or, say, the design of the very popular, probably the most famous Scottish designer-architect Charles McIntosh.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
As it turned out, this is a very popular niche.

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
What we should talk about next is probably the most key approach or specifics of this type of companies.

59:46.000 --> 59:56.000
It is always a narrow specialization, it is always a niche, and it is a focused approach to business.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Moreover, if we talk about high-tech companies, then here is their very good ability to recognize technological capabilities and use them.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:22.000
In particular, the companies I told you about, Stone Soft, F-Secure, are software companies that have developed products,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
they are mainly connected with computer security, which have become very interesting for large companies,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
which are already actively present in the international markets.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:48.000
In particular, we are already starting to talk about how these very global ones penetrate the global market.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:05.000
So, our first access channel is close communication with large companies, which can act as, for example, system integrators or distributors of products born globally.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Another access channel of products born globally on the international market is the use of various associations, networks.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:29.000
In this situation, several independent companies are united in such a network and have a common goal, for example, the goal of conquering the global market.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:41.000
They share resources and thus try to achieve the most cherished synergetic effect.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
When we have 1 plus 1 is equal to 3.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And finally, the Internet is probably the most understandable access channel for the global market, which Amazon used brilliantly.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Thus, having the opportunity to reach out, to serve consumers in almost any corner of the world.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And finally, another model, another opportunity for access to the global market.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And these are already various opportunities for using virtualization of business.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Let's see what are the possibilities and models involved here.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The first model is the model of a remote global partnership.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
What does it represent?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:45.000
It is a situation when several companies share resources to create new products, processes, and what else can you imagine.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
At the same time, they work in close communication with each other.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And so, at the output, you get a desired product.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:08.000
In particular, we can say that such a scheme or such a logic was used to form a partnership between IBM, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard to create a language of YALA.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The second model is the core and satellites.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
What does this model already imply?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
In the first case, we saw that we are talking about independent companies.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Here, we are still talking about independent companies, legally.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
But these companies are united.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Due to the fact that there is a focal firm, a core.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And this core interacts with organizations that support its activities.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:02.000
In particular, we can say that advertising agencies, suppliers, wholesalers, retail traders can act as such supportive organizations.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Nevertheless, we all focus on this focal firm.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In particular, this is how, for example, Ford and its suppliers around the world work.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The third type of organization, the third model, is a virtual value chain.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
What is this model?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Here we see that a coordinated set of transactions is carried out between companies that serve end consumers,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and it does not matter in which country in the world,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:49.000
using information technology and supporting the development of a product or service for end consumers.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Let's recall what a sound recording product is.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
How is it created?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
If we look at the real world,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
what do companies need to create this real product,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:17.000
which the consumer will eventually receive as a CD or audio cassette with the recordings of their favorite artists?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
In this case, in the physical world, the company will have to find this artist,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:38.000
record him, arrange the work, create a master tape,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and distribute this product.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The promotion of this product will also be our function.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Now let's recall the situation.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
What or how does the Internet transform this type of business?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000
In fact, today any artist has the opportunity to record his great work and post it on the Internet.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And then he will see how much his work will interest the public.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But companies do not want to lose such a profitable business as sound recording.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And so, in particular, a company like Geffen Records,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:42.000
having caught this trend, decided that they should create a virtual chain of values.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
How has this business transformed?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It has transformed due to the fact that you are still looking for some artists in the real world.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Although, by the way, you can find these artists on the Internet.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It doesn't matter.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Then they have a website, which they use as a platform for testing consumer reaction.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Accordingly, any consumer, when he or she enters this page,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
can listen to some artist or a group,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
assess how much he or she is interested in this or not.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And then on the same site, he or she can see when and where this group will perform,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
if, of course, the consumer is interested.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Also, through this site, he or she can order a physical product

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
or download this or that music to their computer.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
So, what are we talking about?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
About the fact that the chain of values has become virtual.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The next model is an integrated company.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
In this case, a group of companies works as a single, vertically integrated company,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
which produces certain goods or services.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Here, for example, can be a company called ConElevators.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
This is a Finnish elevator manufacturer.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000
They integrate the activities of their branches around the world in this way,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
which allows them to exchange ideas about new products,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
about the opinion of consumers about their products,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
technical characteristics, discuss, and so on.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And finally, the fifth model is an electronic market.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This is a system where individual companies work in this very system of the electronic market,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000
which implies the use of technology exclusively as a means of interaction with the end consumer.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Let's take Amazon, which interacts with its suppliers and consumers around the world.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Let's take the same electronic newspapers on the Internet.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Or let's take a less well-known example, the company Feonichek.com.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
This is an American company that was established in the 1950s.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It was a small family business in the production of standard furniture.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000
They had their warehouses, but the business was, let's say, modest.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But with the advent of the Internet, the company decided to pay attention to the opportunities that had opened up.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And what did they do?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:05.000
They created a studio in which they create various furniture options.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:15.000
They shoot, and then they exhibit various furniture combinations on their website.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The second aspect is that they have a relationship with suppliers who are able to deliver products to the end consumer on their own.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And they offer products of any class, from standard furniture to Ampere-style furniture.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
At the same time, what does the company do?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
The company is engaged in brokerage.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And they say that they are not engaged in a furniture business as such.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:02.000
They are engaged in marrying the consumer to individual and ideal furniture.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
The Russian market

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Now let's move on to our companies, to the Russian companies.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Why do you think that we still know very few examples of successful Russian companies entering the foreign market?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.000
There are many arguments, the most common of which is the following.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
The first is that the Russian market is limitless.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
There are a lot of opportunities here.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And, accordingly, companies can feel at home in the Russian market for many years.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But, again, returning to the warnings of demographers, we remember that the population of Russia is shrinking.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And, what is even worse, the population of Russia is aging.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And, in general, we must, again, state that this will probably be due to the fact that the purchasing power of the population will decrease, and the domestic market will shrink.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:43.000
The second argument, why it is not worth considering the Russian market as such a rubber market,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:55.000
is because the competition in this market is still increasing, and there is really less and less niche where you can win leadership positions.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:08.000
The second typical argument is that the foreign markets are so competitive, mature, structured, that it is simply dangerous to go there.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
But I will not even say that the code of these markets can be broken.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that we should not forget that there are dynamic and developing markets,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:40.000
such as China and India, where you can find your consumer, which is what Russian companies such as Baltic or Siberian Berks are trying to do.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And, finally, another argument that, unfortunately, sounds very sad, is that Russian companies have nothing to do with the foreign market.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
We just really do not have competitive advantages.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:19.000
This argument can also be argued. Yes, there are certainly problems, but let's say that the Russian product can be a source of new feelings for foreign consumers.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And then, even if we try to understand what Russian products are in the eyes of foreign consumers,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:41.000
then, in general, we very often remember such brands as Kalashnikov, Bolshoi Theater, vodka.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:51.000
It is difficult to talk about a specific brand, although, perhaps, a Western consumer perceives vodka as a brand of the capital.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And so on. In general, a good product, high-quality, and therefore we can quite expect that a foreign consumer, if you can convince him of this, will be happy to buy Russian products.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Plus, there are still some opportunities for using affordable and sometimes, in comparison with the positions of foreign competitors, cheap resources.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And this should not be forgotten.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Now let's try to think about how to penetrate the global markets of Russian companies.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And here, probably, a very good support is the strategic models of globalization, which are used by companies from countries with developing markets, such as China, Brazil, India, and so on.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000
What approaches do these companies use and what do they achieve?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
The first strategy is to bring domestic food lines and brands to the global market.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:15.000
There is a clear prerequisite here. And the prerequisite is strong positions in the domestic market.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:32.000
At the same time, your international expansion will be based on the fact that you bring products that are either understandable to the consumer, that is, they have a wide recognition, or they are simply enough to adapt to the new markets.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:48.000
At the same time, such companies that follow this strategy are quite actively using deliveries for so-called private brands, that is, for brands of retail networks, and for OEMs.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000
What is OEM? These are deliveries for the brand of a well-known manufacturer.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Here you can pay attention to such a company as Koch Holding. This is the largest Turkish holding.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:19.000
In particular, one of its branches, Archelik, which deals with white and brown technology production, began to actively penetrate the foreign markets in the 1980s.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And in fact, they used the strategy of so-called organic growth, when gradually, slowly, trade representatives opened up in different countries.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:44.000
These were England, Germany, France. As you understand, the markets are really serious, structured, and highly competitive.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Since we are talking about white technology, we immediately remember the Siemens company, Bosch Siemens. We are talking about Merlon, Electrolux, and other well-known companies.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:23.000
These are really complex markets. But at the same time, the companies have managed to win significant positions in these markets. In particular, in the UK, they have gradually won a share of 14% in the refrigerator market.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:35.000
At the same time, they still manage to hold leading positions in their domestic market. They occupy about 50% of the market.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:50.000
What else is very important for these companies is that in developed markets they strive to position their products as a worthy alternative to well-known brands.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:07.000
What is the reason? A good price-quality ratio. Moreover, we are forced to say more and more often that consumers no longer feel the difference between well-known brands and less well-known brands.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:23.000
This is the border between quality and quality of products. Consumers are asking themselves why they should pay more. The next type of strategy is marketing of innovative solutions based on technologies.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The prerequisite here is the presence of scientific and engineering talents in areas where you can achieve a stable competitive advantage. What is happening here? This is a support for the country's competitive advantages.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:54.000
This is a high level of education, development of science. Moreover, what is this type of company based on? They have caught the obvious trend of crowd-sourcing.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:15.000
We can see that gradually India has become a mecca for companies engaged in software.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:41.000
A successful example is Vipra, the largest provider of software in the world. They have gone from developing cheap software to delivering integrated solutions.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:21:05.000
The price is different, and the attitude of the company is different. To understand what this company is, it had market capitalization in 2006 of $21 billion, while the profit was about half a billion.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
This is a very serious company.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:27.000
The next strategy is global leadership. We are very close to the characteristics of the global. What is it? It is a focus.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It is a specific, narrow product category. Specialization that allows you to be the best in terms of performance, leadership in the field of innovation, and the most important thing is understanding of the consumer needs of the next generation.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:03.000
At the same time, these companies invest in large-scale production. They place production sites all over the world.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:17.000
A very interesting example is the Hong Kong company Johnson Electric. This company started with the production of small electric motors.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Now they have become the leaders of the global market of small electric motors, and are the fastest growing company in the field of production of general products related to movement.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:54.000
These are motors, switches, solenoids, and so on. At the same time, the company has production sites all over the world. In particular, this is China, Latin America, the United States, Western Europe, and research centers cover almost the whole world.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:15.000
This includes Japan, the United States, Israel, and Italy. How did they achieve this? They achieved this by, on the one hand, aggressive organic growth, when you gradually enter the market, but this happens quite quickly.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Plus, they were able to increase the production base, build up competencies, and add specialized food lines, such as precision piezo-ceramic motors.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And again, very high income. In particular, in 2004, their income exceeded $1 billion. At the same time, 67%, or even a little more, was in the market outside the Asian region.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:04.000
For these companies, I repeat, global large-scale production and developed global logistics are very important.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The next type of strategy is the use of natural resources. Perhaps what is much more clear to us is the path, the prelude to expansion, the presence of cheap resources, but at the same time, high-quality resources.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I will not give you examples of Russian companies, but I will give you an example of a Brazilian company, Sade. This company is one of the largest global manufacturers of chilled and frozen food.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It must be said that the company brings new products to the market every year at a huge rate, on average, about 60 new products per year.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:13.000
What does this company expect? The basis of their expansion model is to focus on the expansion of production in Brazil. They do not strive to absorb producers from other countries.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Why in Brazil? Because of low production costs, high quality standards, plus vertical integration. Nevertheless, they make investments in international markets, but mainly in distribution and supply chains.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The next type of strategy is the transfer of new business models to the global market. What is supposed to happen here? You have developed a business model that has been tested on the domestic market and successfully. And you are trying to transfer it to the foreign market.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:22.000
The most curious example is the company Semex, a Mexican cement manufacturer. At the same time, this manufacturer is now the most profitable in the world. In addition to cement, they also produce concrete and various construction mixes.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:39.000
If we look at the sales volume, in 2006 it exceeded $18 billion. This is a very serious business. The company is present in more than 50 countries around the world.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And the global presence is achieved by merging and absorbing. But what business model did they use on the global market? This is the so-called patrimonio hoy program.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:20.000
What did the company do? They merged the construction business with the banking business, offering Mexican consumers a very profitable scheme. What do I mean? In general, research has shown that Mexicans are very poor at saving.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:43.000
In addition, a large part of Mexicans are poor enough and banks simply do not want to provide them with loans. At the same time, a large number of Mexicans build their homes on their own. And, accordingly, cement purchases are largely carried out at a retail price.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:28:05.000
What was the company's offer? How did they try to make life easier for Mexicans? In order for an average Mexican to be able to build his own house, the company offered people to join a group of people, something like a mutual aid cashier.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:23.000
For one invested dollar, you received four dollars in loans, but not in money. You received them in the form of construction mixtures. And thus, you had the opportunity to build the desired home.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:42.000
At the same time, the company also provided additional opportunities for suppliers to provide consumers with discounts on other building materials. This was an economic opportunity.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:56.000
In addition, the costs, or rather, the prices for certain materials, were actually frozen for a long period of time. And all this allowed consumers to get what they wanted.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:23.000
The company successfully tested this approach on the domestic market, and then began to gradually test it on foreign markets. In particular, this program now covers more than 160,000 poor families in Colombia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and other countries around the world.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The sixth model is access to natural resources. Here, expansion is not only done to gain profits from international markets, but also to gain access to vital resources for your company, resources that you need on the domestic market.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:30:05.000
In particular, it is interesting to look at the Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation, the largest steel manufacturer in China. Now, as you know, China is the fastest growing steel market in the world, and it outperforms even the United States.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:27.000
The company has the lowest production base in Asia, advanced technologies, and strong operational competences. At the same time, they are looking for ways to stabilize the supply of iron ore on global markets.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:47.000
For this purpose, they absorb companies operating in this sector. Now, I invite you to think about what opportunities the exit of Russian companies to the international market will be interesting for us.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:31:13.000
The first is the use of deep-rooted processing of raw materials with a significant increase in the added cost. You don't have to follow the examples. Take the forest industry. If we take the round forest and take the next stage of processing, you will see that the price difference will be many times greater.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Accordingly, Russian companies that supply raw materials lose money, or do not make enough profit.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:44.000
The second aspect is the use of state and regional capabilities. Here, you can look for opportunities for construction companies or companies that work in the field of mining.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:58.000
This is mostly for them, although we see that there are various interstate agreements, including the supply of Russian products to foreign markets.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The next aspect is the use of national advantages at the company level. We have already talked about the Metal Park company, which used our skills and was provided with titanium to achieve success at the foreign market.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:41.000
The next aspect is the integration into the technological chains of foreign manufacturers. Here is an example of a Nizhny Novgorod company, Instrument, which supplied steering columns for Mercedes.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:33:04.000
This is a direct example of how you can integrate into these chains. But what is fundamentally important here? It is important that your company is able to provide high-quality products, and even more important, stable high-quality products.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:14.000
You need to satisfy the standards set by the manufacturer, into whose technological chain you will be integrated.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:38.000
The next aspect is the use of advanced technologies. Here, the most curious example is another Russian company, ABC Line Studio, which specializes in the development and creation of virtual tours, panoramic images, and Internet resources.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Not so long ago, in 2005, they launched the Visual Hotels project, which is supposed to create a global Internet resource that will unite the best hotels and hotels in the world in the near future.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:14.000
What is the purpose of all this? The goal is to provide the end consumer with a very clear, high-quality, visual product that shows the hotel from all points of view.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Now the company is present in the markets of the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Cyprus. They are about to implement the hotel description in Spain, Thailand, and Egypt. What does the company do?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:53.000
The global Internet resource is updated with information about the hotels that have joined the project. When we came to the agency, 10 years ago, we saw a high-quality catalog with good photos.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:11.000
But this did not always give us a good picture. Now we see that some hotels on their websites have so-called virtual tours, where you can look to the right, to the left, and evaluate everything that this hotel offers.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Visual Hotels takes you further. You use all the opportunities available to you. In addition, you are shown the location, the aerial photography. You also have the opportunity to walk along the nearby streets, to evaluate your surroundings to understand where your hotel is.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Sometimes, you don't have enough words. It's better to see it once.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:57.000
The next opportunity for Russian companies is a co-export. What do I mean by co-export? I mean your opportunities.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I must say that now Russian companies should pay more attention to niche strategies, rather than to the serious market leadership.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:31.000
What companies have really succeeded here? Basque has succeeded. It produces clothing and equipment for active and extreme sports and recreation.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:44.000
The geography of the company's activities today is Canada, the United States, Scandinavian countries, India. This is a serious global market.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Why? Because they supply high-quality products at relatively low prices and with a wide range.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But this niche strategy was originally oriented to the top of the pyramid of this market. The fashion is dictated by professional climbers and researchers.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:45.000
The company, supplying products for various expeditions, has won their trust and now uses all their clothing and equipment. More and more of this can be available to the mass market.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Another option is buying assets abroad. Sometimes, this is done to avoid certain barriers.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:19.000
For example, Altervest is a Russian ice cream manufacturer. After the international fair Intercool 2002, it received orders from several foreign retailers to supply ice cream.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:36.000
But the fact is that the EU has prohibitive tariffs on milk-containing products, plus there is a very strict and complex certification system. The markets where they had the opportunity to get access are very rich and interesting.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:50.000
What did the company do? In 2004, the company acquired a control package from a German company and became the co-owner of an ice cream factory in Poland.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:39:10.000
In particular, the German company Altervest was able to conclude an agreement with several German retail chains on the supply of ice cream, but only to retail brands.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Before we move on to the next question, I would like you to answer the question, what strategy do you think is the most optimal for your company, based on your experience and the opportunities we have just discussed?
