00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
My name is Elena Chistykova. I am a personal consultant and a business coach.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.500
I am a member of the International Association of Cross-Cultural Management of Vienna, Austria.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I work with well-known training companies and training centers.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.500
Today I will tell you about the laws of effective business relations.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.500
You will be able to better understand yourself, establish effective interaction in the team,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.500
and you will be able to successfully cope with complex communication tasks.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.000
Business communication.

00:31.500 --> 00:38.000
By business communication we mean any communication that is aimed at obtaining a specific business result.

00:38.500 --> 00:45.000
This can be public speeches, presentations, negotiations or meetings.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.000
It can be telephone communication with suppliers and customers.

00:49.500 --> 00:55.000
It can be business interactions that take place at workplaces.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.500
What is the essence of business communication and what makes it different from personal communication?

01:00.000 --> 01:10.500
The fact is that the definition of business relations says that business communication is aimed at obtaining a specific business result.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.500
Therefore, in the two main components of communication, informational and emotional,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.500
the main attention is paid to the informational.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.000
In business communication we always talk more about business, about something specific.

01:26.500 --> 01:33.000
In personal communication, the goal of personal communication is communication itself, our relationship.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.000
Most of the time we communicate at the emotional level.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.000
A person feels comfortable when communication takes place at both levels.

01:42.500 --> 01:48.000
Therefore, if we communicate only at the informational level, if we communicate dryly, without emotions,

01:48.000 --> 01:53.500
it leads to burnout, the motivation of the staff decreases.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.500
No one likes to communicate only about specific results.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.500
Therefore, the question of ethics of business relations, the right regulation,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.500
the right compromise between the result and the relations.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.500
What to do? How to achieve this?

02:15.500 --> 02:19.000
Secrets in effective techniques.

02:19.500 --> 02:29.000
Therefore, today we will talk about the system tasks, the approach to business communication.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.000
Therefore, today we will use a system approach.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.000
We will talk about communication as a whole, about the laws of success,

02:37.500 --> 02:41.000
about the points of vulnerability that can interfere with our effective communication.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.500
We will talk about specific practical skills that will allow us to succeed

02:47.000 --> 02:51.500
in complex business communications and public speeches.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.500
If we approach business communication as a whole, we must consider the business communication strategy.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.500
That is, how we build the goals of business communication and how we go to our specific business result.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.000
There are three main strategies.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.000
The first strategy is the strategy of the conqueror.

03:18.500 --> 03:23.000
This is a strategy of war, where there are no two winners or two losers.

03:23.500 --> 03:32.000
This is a strategy of a duel, when one person wins, and the other person loses.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.500
The advantage of this strategy is that the winner gets the maximum business result.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.500
All his goals are fulfilled and fulfilled 100%.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.500
He is the master of the position, he is the master of the conquered territory.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.500
However, the disadvantages are the same as in war.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.500
Most often we become the masters of the conquered territory, if we come to it as a conqueror.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.500
It is difficult to get some resources.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.500
Therefore, the strategy of the conqueror is not always successful.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.500
At the same time, it cannot be rejected.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.500
It is good in cases when you use it once and further relations do not make sense.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.500
Then it can be effective.

04:23.500 --> 04:30.000
If you see that during business negotiations your partner communicates,

04:30.500 --> 04:38.000
based on this strategy, you should accept it and be able to behave and interact with it.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.000
Although it is not always effective.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.000
The next strategy is the strategy of compromise.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.000
In these cases, the interaction is more constructive.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.500
Nobody burns the surface of the earth.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.500
However, everyone goes for a compromise.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.500
And the goals of both participants are not fulfilled 100%.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.500
The conditions of compromise are always softer and more natural than the strategy of the conqueror.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.500
You do not have to confront, you can discuss and do further business.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.500
You can cooperate for a long time and fruitfully.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.500
But the goals are not fulfilled.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.500
You always have to sacrifice something.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.500
It is not always convenient.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.500
Because in business it is very difficult to choose what to sacrifice and what to do.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.500
You always want to achieve the maximum result.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.500
Therefore, the strategy of compromise seems to be the most profitable and correct.

05:45.500 --> 05:50.000
We are inside the situation, we are immersed in it and do not see it from above.

05:50.500 --> 05:56.000
If we take the strategy of unity, the strategy called win-win,

05:56.500 --> 06:01.000
that is, to win and to win, this is the strategy of two participants who rise above the situation,

06:01.500 --> 06:09.000
who unite their business goals, who achieve 100% results in both cases.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.500
That is, the total percentage result is above all praises, it is 200% and more.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.500
Why does this happen?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.500
Of course, creativity, new ways of development, new ways of decision-making.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.500
It is very important to try to bring any negotiations to the strategy of unity.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.500
What are the disadvantages of the strategy of unity?

06:30.500 --> 06:41.000
They require a lot of resources to clarify points of view, to unite your opinions, to unite your positions.

06:41.500 --> 06:48.000
Therefore, effective communication skills are required in order to unite goals and find a common solution.

06:48.500 --> 06:57.000
Skills are needed to clarify positions, as well as to find a creative solution that would suit both sides.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.500
Today we will deal with all the elements of all three strategies.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.500
We will talk about what to do when the strategy of the conqueror is set against you.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.500
We will talk about how to effectively behave in the strategy of compromise, if it is imposed on you.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.500
And we will talk about how to effectively communicate and apply the strategy of unity, the strategy of win-win.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.000
The tactics of business communication.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.000
We have already talked about the strategies of business communication.

07:29.500 --> 07:40.000
This is a common approach to your business relations, both in negotiations, in everyday communication, and in public speech.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.000
Now we will talk about tactics.

07:43.500 --> 07:49.000
Tactics are specific tools for how to behave within your strategy.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.500
You don't need to think that every tactic is effective for a certain strategy.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.500
This is not the case.

07:56.000 --> 08:07.500
You can use any tactic in any strategy and correctly build a pattern of your communication that will lead you to your business result.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.500
Let's talk about specific tactics.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.500
You see that there are two columns on the slide.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.500
Indeed, one tactic is opposite to the other.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.500
For example, the first line is a closed tactic and the second line is an open tactic.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.500
What is it and how are they different?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.500
We see, we even say, here is a closed person and here is an open person.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.500
This is what it is.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.500
The other thing is that we psychologically refer to more closed and more open types.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.500
An effective communicator will specifically choose the right tactic, defined in this particular situation.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.500
The most successful and winning.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.500
When you use an open tactic, you are open-minded.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.500
You provide the maximum of the necessary information to the interlocutor.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.500
You answer all his questions.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.500
You are happy to clarify the circumstances.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.500
You reveal all the business and features of the specific situation that you are discussing.

09:17.500 --> 09:22.000
In a closed tactic, this is hidden.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.000
The maximum privacy of the information.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.000
We see only the minimum of information.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
The most public, the most open.

09:29.500 --> 09:33.000
Usually, it is provided in the form of documents, so as not to say unnecessary.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.000
You are minimally open to information.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.000
This is immediately noticeable to others.

09:37.500 --> 09:44.000
Therefore, this tactic is effective in the case when you feel an attack, feel pressure on you.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.500
Then a closed tactic will allow you to focus and stay inside your information field.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.500
An open tactic is effective in other cases and is considered more effective.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.500
Now it is said that an open tactic is the best way to motivate your subordinates.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.500
Many top managers say, why would I share my decisions, my forecasts and strategies with my subordinates.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.500
They should do what I say.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.500
It is important for them to hear what task they need to do.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.500
However, this is wrong.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.500
Because the low motivation of a simple, stupid execution is a slave.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.500
Now people are developed, they want to be personalities.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.500
They want to understand why they need to do a specific business task.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.500
Therefore, openness is sometimes the driving factor for successful motivation of employees.

10:41.500 --> 10:49.000
The next two tactics are role-based and personal.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.000
Why are they opposite?

10:51.500 --> 10:56.000
When a personal tactic is used, you are as open as possible.

10:56.500 --> 11:06.000
All your movements, all your thoughts, all your decisions come from your personality.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.500
Or as if from your personality, if you use it as a game.

11:12.000 --> 11:26.500
If you use a role-based tactic, then all decisions, words, everything you say comes from your business or social role.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.500
When is a personal tactic effective?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.500
In fact, in most cases of business communication in places.

11:34.500 --> 11:39.000
It is very successful for opening up your charisma in a public speech.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.000
It is not just a regular accountant.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.000
It is not an accountant standing in front of people, but a personality.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.000
It attracts attention, it causes trust.

11:49.500 --> 11:57.000
In conversations, in a comfortable emotional atmosphere, the most beneficial, the most effective is a personal tactic.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.000
Because you look like a personality, you look like a leader, an effective communicator.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.500
When is a role-based tactic used?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.500
A role-based tactic is used as a way of protection.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.500
Either from manipulation, or from too tough behavior of a partner or a negotiator.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.500
When you are pressured, you can close yourself and say,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.500
I'm just an accountant, I have to do what I do.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.500
It's a kind of shell, a kind of wall.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.500
Trust in you is undoubtedly falling.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.500
Your charisma, of course, is closing.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.000
But you are protecting yourself.

12:31.500 --> 12:37.000
The next two tactics are confrontation and partnership.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.000
What is the difference?

12:40.500 --> 12:48.000
Partnership causes immersion in the opinion of the interlocutor.

12:48.500 --> 12:52.000
You listen to him carefully, try to understand.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.000
You live his goals and thoughts.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.000
Emotionally support him.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.500
Try to unite your own and his interests.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.500
Confrontation is a tactic of stable behavior.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.500
You have set certain goals.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.500
You have found out what strategy goes to them.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.500
You do not show any flexibility, but are planned, move and move to your goal.

13:24.500 --> 13:31.000
All the suggested thoughts, opinions, arguments do not matter.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.000
You do what you think is necessary.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.000
You go and go in your own way.

13:36.500 --> 13:45.000
Again, confrontation is good, especially when you have chosen the winner's strategy.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.000
Of course, you go and go with a blunt wedge.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.500
But remember that a flexible person sitting opposite you can use new tools against this.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.500
Catch you in a trap.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.500
Chess players will say, make a fork.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.500
And then you will look funny.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Be careful.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.500
Confrontation is a strong tactic.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.500
But it is too tough.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.500
Like a razor blade.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.500
It is sharp, but can easily break.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.500
When choosing a strategy, you should play a game.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.500
You should not choose this tactic and deny any flexibility.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.500
It can seriously interfere with you.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.500
I did not place these 6 tactics in two columns in vain.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.500
You noticed that the tactics of openness, personal tactics and partnership are located on the right.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.000
People smile and are successful and happy.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.000
On the left is a closed tactic.

14:51.500 --> 14:54.000
Role and confrontation.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.000
You are closed, you are ready for war.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.000
In fact, all these tactics are equally effective.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.000
You can use both.

15:03.500 --> 15:11.000
However, open personal tactics and partnership are considered more effective.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.500
You need to understand that you use them here and now.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.500
Because it is necessary at this particular moment.

15:20.000 --> 15:29.500
But the most effective negotiations, the most effective public speech is where personal and open tactics are used.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.500
Therefore, try to translate the tactics of your interlocutor and your tactics from the left column to the right.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.000
From confrontation to partnership.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.000
From role tactics to personal tactics.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.000
From closed to open.

15:45.500 --> 15:51.000
In fact, this information can be much more important than all the previous ones.

15:51.500 --> 15:58.000
Because the previous ones are often told in MBA courses, in business trainings.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.000
And they can be read in various books.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.000
What is written on this slide is very important.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.500
Because it has a great impact on business relations.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.500
But we often forget about it.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.500
What I will say now, you don't need to look for in others.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.500
Try to find it in yourself.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.500
Try to find ways to get away from this situation.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.500
And more effective and flexible behavior.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.500
Personal aspects of business relations.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.500
We will start with the fact that we will consider the institutions.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.500
The institutions of our personality, which on the one hand help us to live happily,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.500
help us to live calmly and not go crazy, but on the other hand, interfere with effective business communication.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.500
For example, let's take the first one.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.500
Estimation.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.500
What is it?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
And what is it bad about?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.500
And what is it good about?

17:03.500 --> 17:10.000
It is good because by evaluating people around us, we simplify our picture of the world.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.000
If we have evaluated this person, we know whether he is good or bad.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.000
We know what to expect from him, what to expect from his actions.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.000
And we can generalize some of his qualities.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.000
If it is bad in one, then bad in another.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.000
Everything becomes much easier.

17:24.500 --> 17:30.000
You don't have to spend every moment of time to understand what kind of person he is and what will happen next.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.000
On the other hand, it is very annoying.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.500
For example, if we see that this person is poorly dressed,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.500
we can decide that he has bad business qualities,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.500
that he is incompetent in the matter in which he came to deal with.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.500
Why? In fact, he may be just poorly dressed and very competent.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.500
There are many examples of this.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.500
Therefore, such an extrapolation of qualities, if he is bad in one, then bad in another,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.500
may interfere with us because we lose a lot of resources.

18:00.500 --> 18:04.000
For example, the resources of the person we will not have relations with later

18:04.500 --> 18:08.000
simply because he looks somehow illiterate.

18:08.500 --> 18:13.000
At the same time, if a person made a mistake once,

18:13.500 --> 18:17.000
that is, if he did something wrong at work,

18:17.500 --> 18:22.000
then our assessment system immediately decides that he will always do it wrong.

18:22.500 --> 18:27.000
It adjusts us to negative attitudes towards this person.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.500
Of course, I understand that even in personal relations this is often very important,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.500
but in business it is important twice as much.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.500
We stop supporting this person, we stop praising him.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.500
And it becomes even worse for him, he made a mistake.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.500
His self-esteem drops and he prefers to leave this workplace

18:49.000 --> 18:51.500
than to correct the mistake and move on.

18:52.500 --> 18:59.000
Therefore, the assessment system is good for us, but it is very distracting.

18:59.500 --> 19:05.000
It is best to decide every time what kind of person this person is,

19:05.500 --> 19:10.000
to explain everything very specifically, here and now,

19:10.500 --> 19:17.000
and to understand that we are talking only about those qualities that we are talking about,

19:17.000 --> 19:22.500
without letting our brain rest and relax, preventing us from perceiving others.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.500
The next setting is the rigidity setting.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.500
Young people who communicate with their parents are familiar with it.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.500
This setting is also called the problem of fathers and children.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.500
Rigidity is the inability to perceive new things in the psyche.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.500
The inability to change very quickly.

19:43.500 --> 19:48.000
The inability to change their opinion due to some arguments.

19:48.500 --> 19:53.000
Most often we say, yes, I hear this setting perfectly and I know it perfectly.

19:53.500 --> 19:58.000
Everyone around me is so rigid, I tell them something, but they don't hear me.

19:58.500 --> 20:02.000
But in fact, maybe they don't even need to be told this.

20:02.500 --> 20:06.000
Maybe it's worth listening to what they say and taking their point of view.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.000
In business, it is especially important to be flexible.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.000
If you move on a break, you can always move in one direction and lose the market.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.000
Therefore, the rigidity setting simplifies our life.

20:17.500 --> 20:21.000
Because the world is as it is, and you don't need to spend extra resources

20:21.500 --> 20:25.000
to understand something new, to understand new interactions in this world.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.000
But in fact, any successful businessman will say,

20:28.500 --> 20:33.000
if you don't absorb new things, don't find new ways of development,

20:33.500 --> 20:38.000
don't accept the creativity of others and the creativity of your own group,

20:38.500 --> 20:42.000
then it is impossible to win in the market, it is impossible to become a leader.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.500
Therefore, the rigidity setting is natural for the elderly.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.500
With age, rigidity is normally enhanced.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.500
But nevertheless, listen to yourself.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.500
Maybe you have already become completely confident in one opinion.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.500
Then it is worth changing it, it is worth getting used to it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.500
Around the universe of opinions, the universe of choices,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.500
you can find new ways of development.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.000
This will help you to solve the strategy of win-win.

21:13.500 --> 21:17.000
The next setting is the ego-centrism setting.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.000
This is a very interesting setting.

21:20.500 --> 21:24.000
We are talking about an egoist, an egocentric person

21:24.500 --> 21:28.000
who is constantly looking for attention, constantly in the center of attention,

21:28.500 --> 21:32.000
constantly attracting others to himself, who is always thinking about himself,

21:32.500 --> 21:36.000
whose self-confidence is very high.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.000
In fact, this is not so.

21:39.500 --> 21:45.000
The ego-centrism setting, on the contrary, prevents us from gaining self-confidence,

21:45.500 --> 21:48.000
prevents us from attracting others.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.000
Why does this happen?

21:51.500 --> 21:58.000
The ego-centrism setting itself says that everything that happens around a person

21:58.500 --> 22:02.000
is taken into account.

22:02.500 --> 22:07.000
Everything that happens, happens either for good or for evil.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.500
All the people who are around him are for the sake of this person.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.500
But this is certainly not so.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.500
After all, when they laugh behind our backs, they do not always laugh at us.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.500
But we often think that this is so.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.500
Therefore, when the ego-centrism setting presses very hard on you,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.500
you are always worried about who and what and how thought about you.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.500
You always think that if some kind of failure has happened,

22:35.500 --> 22:39.000
then it is directed against you by evil.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.000
You always think that if you are not noticed,

22:43.500 --> 22:46.000
then these people are angry with you.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.000
They direct their aggression at you.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.000
But this is not so.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.000
These people are just people, and they have their own world, their own universe.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.000
You have your own world, and you have your own universe.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.000
They do not necessarily intersect.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.000
In the same way, in order to attract the attention of others,

23:01.500 --> 23:05.000
you need to get away from this setting.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.000
An boring lecturer who reads his lecture in a dull voice,

23:09.500 --> 23:15.000
he thinks that everyone is listening to him.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.000
In fact, everyone thinks about their own problems,

23:19.500 --> 23:21.000
about tasks at work.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.000
But at the same time, in order to attract the attention of the audience,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.000
you need to make an effort,

23:26.500 --> 23:30.000
you need to take certain steps,

23:30.500 --> 23:33.000
you need to apply specific tools,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.500
specific techniques, and then it will work.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.500
The audience never pays attention to itself.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.500
Therefore, the setting of egocentrism prevents you from doing so.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.500
In order to be confident in yourself, create your own universe.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.500
In order to attract attention, do it.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.500
Do not let it get to you.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.500
The next setting is the setting of projection.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.500
It is very disturbing in our relations,

24:00.500 --> 24:04.000
especially if you look at the international and political level.

24:04.500 --> 24:10.000
In fact, the setting of projection says that we always project

24:10.500 --> 24:14.000
our beliefs, our worldview,

24:14.500 --> 24:18.000
our thoughts about our world,

24:18.500 --> 24:23.000
our understanding of this world, our experience to other people.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.000
We believe that if what we have in our head,

24:26.500 --> 24:29.000
we must have it in the heads of others.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.500
And often, therefore, we cannot understand their actions.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.500
We cannot accept their position.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.500
We cannot open them for ourselves.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.500
We cannot establish effective strategies and tactics of business relations,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.500
because we believe that the strategy or tactics that we have chosen,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.500
is definitely chosen by our partner,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.500
a participant of our communication.

24:57.500 --> 25:02.000
Therefore, this setting is very disturbing to openness

25:02.500 --> 25:05.000
and effective interaction.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.000
The search for weak sides in our partner.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.000
The search for strong sides.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.000
Do not project your strong sides and your weak sides

25:13.500 --> 25:15.000
on the person we communicate with.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.000
This is especially important in tough negotiations.

25:26.500 --> 25:32.000
The next aspect of relations is its multilevel.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.000
We have already talked about this a little,

25:35.500 --> 25:39.000
but now we will talk in more detail.

25:39.500 --> 25:44.000
In fact, in any relationship, both business and personal,

25:44.500 --> 25:48.000
there are two fields, two levels of interaction.

25:48.500 --> 25:54.000
This is the emotional background, emotional interaction,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.500
and the informational background, informational interaction.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.500
Most often emotionally, in general, emotions are a deeper,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.500
more ancient level of interaction.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.500
The more ancient areas of our main brain are responsible for it.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.500
The beginnings of emotions can be found in highly developed animals.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.500
The informational background is more modern.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.000
The emotional background is more modern.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.000
The main brain is responsible for it.

26:27.500 --> 26:31.000
The intellectual activity exists only in a person.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.000
Some people think that if a person is a person,

26:34.500 --> 26:38.000
then there is only an informational background in his communication.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.000
The most important thing is what he says, but in fact it is not so.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.000
Most of the information we receive is not verbal.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.000
We receive it at the level of sensations,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.500
so if we pay attention only to the informational component,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.500
we will not succeed.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.500
If the emotional background of your interlocutor is low,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.500
that is, he is upset or angry,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.500
or he is in a state of apathy,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.500
in any case, it will be impossible to reach him.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.500
All the information that comes to him will be blocked by his main brain.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.500
Why?

27:14.500 --> 27:21.000
Because the maximum resources are aimed at neutralizing his negative emotions.

27:21.500 --> 27:26.000
Or to change the situation so that these emotions come to normal.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.000
That is, either change them inside or outside.

27:31.500 --> 27:36.000
On the other hand, even if some of the information gets into the brain,

27:36.500 --> 27:41.000
in any case it will be associated with negative emotions.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.500
A person will never like what you told him when he was angry or upset.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.500
It can hurt even more than if he does not hear what you say at all.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.500
Therefore, in any interaction, it can be a presentation, a public speech,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.500
a meeting, a discussion, a discussion,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.500
or just ordinary business relations at work.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.500
In any case, it is necessary to have a negative background.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.000
In any case, it is necessary to have a negative background.

28:12.500 --> 28:17.000
It is necessary to start with it, otherwise everything else becomes pointless.

28:17.500 --> 28:22.000
The slide shows an approximate diagram of how to act

28:22.500 --> 28:26.000
during any conversation, any interaction.

28:26.500 --> 28:32.000
During the entire first stage, it is necessary to pay attention to emotional development.

28:33.000 --> 28:39.500
During the entire first stage, it is necessary to pay attention to emotional development.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.500
Effective top managers know that the higher you are on the hierarchical ladder of the company,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.500
the more attention you need to pay to the introduction to the conversation.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.500
The more attention the instrument of small conversations,

28:56.000 --> 29:00.500
conversations about nothing, conversations that build up an atmosphere of interaction,

29:00.500 --> 29:04.000
a pleasant and pleasant one for work.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.000
We will talk about how to do this later.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.000
But now back to the diagram.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.000
The emotional background is established, everyone feels good,

29:15.500 --> 29:19.000
the atmosphere of communication exists.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.000
Then you can move on to the information field,

29:22.500 --> 29:27.000
start exchanging information, passing it on and creating information.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.500
But it is very important that during the course of the event,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.500
during your interaction, you need to return to the emotional background,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.500
constantly monitor it.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.500
Why?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.500
So that it does not become negative in any case.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.500
Very often in the midst of some kind of interaction, argument, discussion,

29:51.000 --> 29:56.500
or, especially important, in the midst of some kind of proposal, presentation,

29:57.000 --> 30:02.500
you stop noticing the environment, immerse yourself in your thoughts and ideas.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.500
At this moment, the emotional background of your interlocutor may change.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.500
He may get tired of aggressive information transfer,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.500
he may experience some kind of internal resistance to this information.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.500
If you miss the moment, then the whole business conversation, everything goes to waste.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.000
All results go to waste.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.000
They don't even appear.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.000
Therefore, it is very important that these small steps,

30:32.500 --> 30:35.000
a small return to the emotional background,

30:35.500 --> 30:38.000
are necessary between the information blocks.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.000
Which is usually longer.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.000
After all, the goal of our business communication, we must not forget,

30:45.500 --> 30:49.000
is not the relationship, but information and business result.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.500
But it is very important to finish your speech, your negotiations,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.500
not by summing up, as very often happens,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.500
but again, with a positive emotional background.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.500
It is necessary to have certain tools for establishing an emotional background at the end of the meeting.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.500
A person, saying goodbye to you, leaving the room or the auditorium,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.500
must definitely experience a feeling of rising, positive emotions.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.500
Then he will want to meet you again,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.500
establish a long-term relationship, establish cooperation.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.500
And this will help the result of the meeting.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.500
In no case can you finish the meeting with a negative emotional background.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.500
Even if you didn't come to anything,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.500
even if you didn't achieve the business result at this meeting,

31:43.000 --> 31:47.500
the last step in any case should be to establish a positive emotional background.

31:47.500 --> 31:52.000
You must make your client happy and happy, even if he didn't buy anything.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.000
Then he will come to you again.

31:55.500 --> 32:01.000
Remember this in a situation of unresolved interaction,

32:01.500 --> 32:04.000
when you didn't achieve the result.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.000
You can be upset yourself, but please,

32:07.500 --> 32:14.000
you need to try to establish the emotional background of your interlocutor as much as possible.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.500
The first and most important thing,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.500
on the one hand, the simplest and most convenient thing,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.500
you can make much fewer mistakes in it.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.500
This is a change in the tone, pace of speech and volume.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.500
In fact, it is very easy to calm the audience if it is completely infuriated,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.500
if it moves very sharply,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.500
if everyone cannot calm down with the tone of speech.

32:39.500 --> 32:45.000
The tone is very high, for example, like a mouse squeaks.

32:46.500 --> 32:50.000
Or very low, like a bear goes.

32:50.500 --> 32:57.000
It is very important to translate the tone from one register to another.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.000
This is what establishes the emotional background.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.000
If you need to calm the audience,

33:02.500 --> 33:05.000
you go from the upper register to the lower one,

33:05.500 --> 33:08.000
that is, you go down intonationally.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.500
You calm the audience,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.500
you go from the upper register to the lower one.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.500
Practice this on your children.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.500
If you read them a fairy tale with such an intonation,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.500
they will fall asleep very quickly.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.500
Maybe even earlier, and you will fall asleep.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.500
And if you say any words with such an intonation,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.500
your audience will calm down.

33:35.500 --> 33:39.000
You need to finish the sentence at the very bottom.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.000
Again, if you raise the register,

33:42.500 --> 33:45.000
if you want to wake up the audience,

33:45.500 --> 33:48.000
if you want to get rid of apathy,

33:48.500 --> 33:50.000
you need to go from the bottom to the top.

33:50.500 --> 33:54.000
Then everyone will welcome you, everyone will start talking again,

33:54.500 --> 33:58.000
everyone will wake up and will be more active.

33:58.500 --> 34:02.000
The pace of speech is fast and slow.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.500
Slow pace always calms.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.500
This is very important.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.500
If you need to calm down yourself,

34:09.000 --> 34:10.500
slow down your speech,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.500
you will be more calm.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.500
And the volume of speech, of course.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.500
A quiet speech is calmer than a loud one.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.500
The next tool is the use of divisive or unifying pronouns.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.500
In general, unifying is very effective.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.500
If you want to establish development paths,

34:30.500 --> 34:32.000
establish relationships,

34:32.500 --> 34:34.000
unite your goals,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.000
use the pronoun we.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.000
Not I and you, not you.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.000
Be sure to use we right away.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.000
Even if you have not signed the agreements yet.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.000
Even if you are not working in this company yet,

34:45.500 --> 34:48.000
say that it is our company, say we.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.000
This is very important.

34:50.500 --> 34:54.000
At the same time, if you want to disconnect from an unpleasant audience,

34:54.500 --> 34:56.000
from an unpleasant event,

34:56.500 --> 34:58.000
then use the divisive pronoun.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.500
Use statements that affect the self-esteem of the partner.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.500
Compliments are important.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.500
You need to start with them,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.500
and you need to finish with them.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.500
The most important thing in compliments is not to say at all.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.500
You look great today.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.500
This is not a compliment, but a lisp.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.500
You need to say what is great.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.500
What exactly distinguishes an object from another.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.500
Therefore, if you came to a new office,

35:26.500 --> 35:29.000
look at what you liked.

35:29.500 --> 35:33.000
What exactly did you like in the document and in the report that your subordinate brought you?

35:33.500 --> 35:38.000
What exactly did you like in the project that your partners offer you?

35:38.500 --> 35:42.000
What exactly did you like in the words of your boss?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.000
Tell him about it.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.000
This is very important, do not forget.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.000
And the objectivation technique is the last difficult tool.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.000
It is brought in an additional package.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.500
I will not dwell on it for a long time.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.500
I will say simply.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.500
Objectivation is the pronunciation of what is really there.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.500
If you are angry, if you see that your partner is feeling bad,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.500
or experiencing some other negative emotions.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.500
If you feel that the situation has gone into a deadlock,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.500
and that something went wrong,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.500
tell about it without assessing, just like that.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.500
Here I feel bad.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.000
Here you are, Vladimir Ivanovich, I think you are angry.

36:25.500 --> 36:30.000
Here the situation, in my opinion, has gone into a deadlock.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.000
It is very important not to assess, not to look for a reason,

36:33.500 --> 36:35.000
but just to say it.

36:35.500 --> 36:42.000
Believe me, the person who has found the strength to speak out the real situation,

36:42.500 --> 36:44.000
causes the greatest trust.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.000
His charisma is growing incomparably.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.000
Active listening techniques.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.500
In fact, the techniques are quite well known.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.500
Most of the leaders have been to trainings,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.500
where they teach active listening.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.500
These techniques are described in any textbook.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.500
It would seem that there is no point in talking about it in detail now.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.500
But in fact, I want to talk about something else.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.500
I want to talk about the fact that we often hear the interlocutor,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.500
but very rarely listen to him.

37:16.500 --> 37:21.000
The thing is, of course, in the sales techniques it is said that

37:21.500 --> 37:26.000
before presenting your product, you must listen to the interlocutor,

37:26.500 --> 37:28.000
what he needs.

37:28.500 --> 37:32.000
But in fact, this is the basis of the active listening technique.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.000
In order to convince the interlocutor as much as possible,

37:35.500 --> 37:39.000
no matter how strange it is, you do not need to convey your point of view to him.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.000
It is harmful.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.000
In order to convince the interlocutor,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.500
you need to understand his point of view and shake it.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.500
Therefore, in any case, any interaction should start with listening,

37:53.000 --> 37:54.500
with understanding this.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.500
You are probably interested in the fact,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.500
I often talk about it in training,

37:59.000 --> 38:00.500
when I ask, what do you think,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.500
top management of the best companies in the world,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.500
the best 100 companies in the world,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.500
more introverts or more extroverts,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.500
more sociable or more obedient people?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.500
It is very interesting that everyone thinks that they are sociable,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.500
that due to their sociability they have achieved such effective results in their careers.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.500
But in fact, everything is exactly the opposite.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.500
The higher a person is in the hierarchical ladder of a large company,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.500
the more he is an introvert.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.500
He understands, thinks, creates, thinks, creates some concepts,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.500
creates business plans, thinks through the results.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.500
But it is inside his head.

38:40.500 --> 38:45.000
He listens to his subordinates, makes conclusions and makes decisions.

38:45.500 --> 38:49.000
He does not impose his point of view, he interacts.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.000
Therefore, it is very important to listen and start with this.

38:53.500 --> 38:57.000
The situation in any communication, especially in business communication,

38:57.500 --> 38:59.000
is owned by the one who listens,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.000
because he does not make mistakes.

39:01.500 --> 39:06.000
He understands the weaknesses and strengths of his interlocutor.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.500
Therefore, please, active listening.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.500
These techniques are clear, they are detailed in the application.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.500
I want to talk about something else.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.500
We are often prevented from listening to our own point of view,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.500
especially our constant monologue.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.500
We constantly talk to ourselves, we constantly convince ourselves.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.500
I talked about the creation of my own universe,

39:34.500 --> 39:37.000
that it will help to be confident.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.000
Here is the same.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.000
In order to listen to others correctly,

39:42.500 --> 39:46.000
you need to stop your own speech, your own dialogue.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.000
For this, good relaxation techniques are needed.

39:49.500 --> 39:55.000
Concentration on a certain object, for example, on your breath.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.000
Then, by stopping the inner dialogue,

39:58.500 --> 40:02.000
you can listen to others more effectively.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.500
I advise you to use these techniques before any important interaction,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.500
before any important event.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.500
We move from general techniques, general strategies, general tactics

40:25.000 --> 40:28.500
to specific tools, specific events.

40:28.500 --> 40:33.000
The first type of business communication is public speech.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.000
Why did I put it in the first place?

40:36.500 --> 40:40.000
In fact, it is the most exciting, the most serious,

40:40.500 --> 40:45.000
the most important, the most responsible in the events in our life.

40:45.500 --> 40:50.000
As a personal consultant, I can say that I am mostly hired

40:50.500 --> 40:54.000
to develop the skills of public communication.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.500
And to develop the skills of business communication

40:58.000 --> 41:01.500
only in the case when everything is going wrong,

41:02.000 --> 41:06.500
when the conflict situation is so old and persistent

41:07.000 --> 41:10.500
that the situation has gone into a deadlock.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.500
Why does public speech cause such trepidation?

41:15.000 --> 41:19.500
Even one of the main fears of a person is the fear of public speech.

41:19.500 --> 41:24.000
The thing is that public speech is always one against many.

41:24.500 --> 41:27.000
In our ancient archetypal understanding,

41:27.500 --> 41:31.000
one against many is always a risk of death.

41:31.500 --> 41:35.000
Therefore, when we speak in front of an audience,

41:35.500 --> 41:39.000
it is as if we are always risking our lives.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.000
Why does this happen?

41:42.500 --> 41:47.000
Because in the wild tribe, when one person was against all the others,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.500
it could be a situation when she was sick and lagged behind the herd,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.500
and now she will die alone, and no one will be able to protect her.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.500
This is a situation when the herd itself has driven her away,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.500
and this also means close death.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.500
This is a situation when one male is against another.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.500
One leader wants to take the place of another leader in the flock.

42:12.500 --> 42:17.000
In this case, the leaders always fight not for life, but for death.

42:17.500 --> 42:21.000
Therefore, either you become the leader or you die.

42:21.500 --> 42:26.000
Therefore, the key to public speech, if it is reverent for you,

42:26.500 --> 42:31.000
becomes the instrument, the thought, the technique

42:31.500 --> 42:34.000
that I will tell you about now.

42:34.500 --> 42:38.000
Please, imagine, tell yourself, there is nothing wrong.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.000
In any case, I will stay alive.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.500
In any case, I will stay healthy.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.500
In general, nothing will happen, no matter how public the performance is.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.500
Now, what to do in public?

42:54.000 --> 42:57.500
What is next, after you rise?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.500
This is the creation of a positive emotional background.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.500
Of course, you need to start with yourself.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.500
You have already insisted that there is nothing wrong with this,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.500
that everyone can perform publicly.

43:09.500 --> 43:13.000
Take a deep breath, it will lower the diaphragm,

43:13.500 --> 43:17.000
let your lungs breathe, straighten your vocal cords,

43:17.500 --> 43:20.000
and you will be able to speak naturally and openly.

43:20.500 --> 43:24.000
Then you go out in front of the audience.

43:24.500 --> 43:30.000
Stop, be silent for a while, and meet with the audience.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.000
This is important, it will establish contact.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.000
Then you can speak.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.000
And you need to start with establishing an emotional background.

43:39.500 --> 43:42.000
You need to introduce yourself.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.000
And then immediately say compliments,

43:45.500 --> 43:48.000
say thanks,

43:48.500 --> 43:51.000
say good words,

43:51.500 --> 43:54.000
so that everyone feels happy,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.000
calm, happy,

43:57.500 --> 44:01.000
and is tuned and directed to your future performances.

44:01.500 --> 44:06.000
You can preempt a little emotional background,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.500
you can continue,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.500
if no one introduced you, you can start with the introduction,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.500
and then the emotional background.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.500
In the introduction, it is very important to say the following.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.500
Who am I? We have already said about it.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.500
It is very important to say why I came here.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.500
Just because I was invited, I don't know what I'm standing for.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.500
Or do you really want to achieve some results?

44:33.500 --> 44:37.000
Announce them, what results do you want to get yourself.

44:37.500 --> 44:42.000
But it is very important to say that you brought the audience.

44:42.500 --> 44:45.000
Remember the egotistical attitude?

44:45.500 --> 44:48.000
Here I am, I do everything for myself.

44:48.500 --> 44:52.000
But in fact, a person is not interested in listening to you,

44:52.500 --> 44:55.000
not interested in listening to your goals,

44:55.500 --> 44:58.000
not interested in listening to your experience.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.000
A person is interested in listening to himself.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.500
It is more important and more interesting for him to listen

45:04.000 --> 45:08.500
to his own desires, to his own happiness or unhappiness,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.500
problems or tasks, points of vulnerability or ways of development.

45:13.000 --> 45:19.500
Please formulate your whole thing in the way it can bring people.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.500
Speak in their formulas, in their dictionary,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.500
and in their specific terms.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.000
Don't use complex terms of speech, it will be very disturbing.

45:32.500 --> 45:35.000
It will immediately remove the audience from you.

45:35.500 --> 45:38.000
The next part is the content part.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.000
You have established an emotional background, people have introduced themselves,

45:41.500 --> 45:43.000
they understood why you came to them.

45:43.500 --> 45:47.000
And now you can say informational things,

45:47.500 --> 45:52.000
pass information, put it into the heads of others.

45:52.500 --> 45:57.000
Structure your speech, prescribe it.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.500
Be consistent.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.500
When you speak, keep an eye on the eyes of others.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.500
Meet with your eyes.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.500
Six seconds is the best time to keep an eye on the audience.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.500
It does not frighten on the one hand, but on the other hand it attracts.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.500
Please practice.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.500
Keep an eye for six seconds and translate it to another place.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.500
It will help you for further meetings, for further speeches.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.500
It is very important.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.500
Next, the conclusion.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.500
The results.

46:34.000 --> 46:42.500
Psychologists say that the most important part of your speech

46:43.000 --> 46:45.500
is the very beginning and the very end.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.500
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.500
The most important part for you can be placed anywhere.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.500
But if you want to achieve the result,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.500
you must put it in the very beginning or the very end.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.000
So, the conclusion is not about yourself,

46:59.500 --> 47:02.000
but about what you can bring to the audience.

47:02.500 --> 47:06.000
The benefit that it will take from interacting with you.

47:06.500 --> 47:10.000
From fulfilling your goals, too.

47:10.500 --> 47:13.000
So, in the end, it is necessary to have the benefit,

47:13.500 --> 47:16.000
not just a list of what you have already said.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.000
And the last one.

47:18.500 --> 47:22.000
Open the space for further interaction.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.500
You can ask if there are any questions.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.500
They will always say no.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.500
So you need to ask what questions you have.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.500
Tell where people can get additional information.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.500
Tell what steps to take for further interaction with you.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.500
Arrange for further meetings.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.500
Tell a certain schedule.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.500
Anything.

47:47.500 --> 47:53.000
The meeting should not end in a closed form.

47:53.500 --> 48:00.000
It should be open for further interaction.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.000
Otherwise, why was this meeting necessary?

48:03.500 --> 48:09.000
In the previous slide, we talked about the sequence of your speech.

48:09.500 --> 48:13.000
What needs to be done in sequence, what should be paid attention to.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.000
This is a systematic approach.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.500
There are nuances.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.500
The most important nuances.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.500
Nuances are important in all elements of your speech.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.500
We pronounce them.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.500
Always talk not about your problems, tasks, needs,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.500
but about the problems of the audience.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.500
I have already said this.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.500
This is very important.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.500
It is important to tune your message

48:36.000 --> 48:39.500
using the tool I, you and our common cause.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.500
And only based on the concept of our common cause

48:42.500 --> 48:47.000
can you convey your information to the heads of others.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.000
Never read on paper or on the screen.

48:51.500 --> 48:55.000
If you write down your speech when you talk,

48:55.500 --> 48:59.000
and then write down your speech when you read,

48:59.500 --> 49:02.000
you will see a big difference.

49:02.500 --> 49:07.000
You will understand that the speech you read on paper is not saturated.

49:07.500 --> 49:09.000
It is monotonous.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.500
It is not like boo-boo-boo.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.500
Sometimes it is even less saturated.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.500
In addition, the speech you write is very different from the live business speech.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.500
Therefore, the sentences are arranged differently,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.500
and have a different length and interaction of words.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.500
Therefore, please, never read on paper.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.500
You communicate with your paper.

49:36.500 --> 49:39.000
You are happy with your paper.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.000
The audience is happy with their paper.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.000
And they do not perceive this information.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.000
If you can read on paper,

49:47.500 --> 49:50.000
why can't the audience read on paper?

49:50.500 --> 49:53.000
Why do you need to read on paper?

49:53.500 --> 49:57.000
It is also important that you do not have a paper in your hands,

49:57.500 --> 50:00.000
but you have a monitor, a screen,

50:00.500 --> 50:04.000
a presentation, some items, and a lot of small words.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.500
It is very convenient to read these items and small words.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.500
In fact, the presentation is even more effective

50:12.000 --> 50:15.500
when the slide is written in a completely different way than what you say.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.500
Why? Because a person will read what is written on this presentation.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.500
He sees it perfectly.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.500
There is no point in speaking it.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.500
What you speak, you must speak separately.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.500
It should be an addition to the presentation.

50:31.500 --> 50:35.000
If it is difficult for you to formulate your speech,

50:35.500 --> 50:37.000
use writing.

50:37.500 --> 50:39.000
Write a composition.

50:39.500 --> 50:42.000
Moreover, you can write drafts of this speech.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.000
Just always leave them at home.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.000
If it is difficult for you to concentrate and find the right word,

50:48.500 --> 50:51.000
write several versions of these speeches at once.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.000
With such a stream of consciousness,

50:54.500 --> 50:57.000
without thinking for a long time and without formulating words.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.000
Write 5 or 10 versions of the speech.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.000
And then leave all of them at home.

51:03.500 --> 51:06.000
And then, working for an audience,

51:06.500 --> 51:10.000
you will come up with the most necessary, successful,

51:10.500 --> 51:13.000
and the most appropriate version.

51:13.500 --> 51:16.000
Specifically, from this audience, here and now.

51:16.500 --> 51:19.000
The next point is the use of visual tools.

51:19.500 --> 51:22.000
Of course, when we speak simply,

51:22.500 --> 51:26.000
in fact, 70% of the information comes from the visual.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.000
A person is ready for visual information.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.500
It is much more terrible for us if we go blind

51:32.000 --> 51:34.500
than if we go deaf and stop feeling.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.500
Therefore, please, if possible,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.500
if there is an opportunity to create a visual image,

51:43.000 --> 51:44.500
use it.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.500
You can show something with gestures,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.500
if there are no opportunities at all.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.500
PowerPoint is now a great tool

51:54.000 --> 51:56.500
to create interesting visual images.

51:56.500 --> 52:00.000
But the most effective is if visual images appear

52:00.500 --> 52:03.000
during the speech.

52:03.500 --> 52:06.000
Of course, you can use animation,

52:06.500 --> 52:10.000
that is, to bring to life the image and some words on the screen.

52:10.500 --> 52:13.000
But if you draw on the board,

52:13.500 --> 52:16.000
write on the board during the speech,

52:16.500 --> 52:19.000
it is definitely much more

52:19.500 --> 52:22.000
embedded in the heads of your listeners.

52:22.500 --> 52:25.000
Use this tool.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.500
Just like writing,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.500
practice drawing on the board,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.500
at home, on a piece of paper.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.500
The next point is to be brief.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.500
In fact, the briefness is important in everything.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.500
Let's start with the menu items on the slides.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.500
I visit conferences and notice that this is the main mistake.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.500
There are a lot of items.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.500
Or a lot of words in each item.

52:52.500 --> 52:55.000
I have a lot of suggestions.

52:55.500 --> 52:58.000
In fact, if you need to convey a lot of information,

52:58.500 --> 53:01.000
make a brief.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.000
If you have a very rich presentation,

53:04.500 --> 53:07.000
make a lot of slides.

53:07.500 --> 53:10.000
But no more than a slide per minute.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.000
Because more frequent change of the slide is tiring.

53:13.500 --> 53:16.000
There should be no more than 5,

53:16.500 --> 53:19.000
a maximum of 7 items on the slide.

53:19.500 --> 53:22.000
Why is this happening?

53:22.500 --> 53:25.000
Because 7 numbers are much faster

53:25.500 --> 53:28.000
than 8 numbers.

53:28.500 --> 53:31.000
7 words are much faster than 8 words.

53:31.500 --> 53:35.000
In other words, we have a kind of data bus in our head,

53:35.500 --> 53:38.000
which has only 7 cells.

53:38.500 --> 53:41.000
But 7 cells is an extreme number.

53:41.500 --> 53:44.000
Therefore, it is best to have 5 items.

53:44.500 --> 53:47.000
Just like it is most effective

53:47.500 --> 53:50.000
to manage a team of 5 people.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.500
If there are more people in the team,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.500
the level of management and efficiency decreases.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.500
This is a brief about the items in the menu.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.500
Next.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.500
It is very important to be brief in the sentences.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.500
In the written sentences there should be no more

54:07.000 --> 54:09.500
than 5-7 words in the sentence.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.500
It is very important to be brief in the sentences

54:13.000 --> 54:15.500
of those you speak.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.500
You seem to be more expert, smarter and more weighty

54:18.500 --> 54:21.000
than you are.

54:21.500 --> 54:24.000
In fact, almost none of them will be incomprehensible.

54:24.500 --> 54:27.000
Even when you write advertising slogans,

54:27.500 --> 54:30.000
e-mails and phone calls,

54:30.500 --> 54:33.000
you need to speak briefly.

54:33.500 --> 54:37.000
Try to express your thoughts in a more brief form.

54:37.500 --> 54:40.000
Believe me, if something is not clear,

54:40.500 --> 54:43.000
you will be asked a question.

54:43.500 --> 54:46.000
But if you constantly explain something,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.500
you will be judged by the audience.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.500
Your confidence will be reduced.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.500
It is also very important to plan your speech time.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.500
Plan your speech time less than the time

54:58.000 --> 55:00.500
given by the regulations.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.500
There will always be some complicated situations,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.500
some subtleties.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.500
It is very difficult to put all the details

55:10.000 --> 55:12.500
into the speech in the time you say.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.500
And if you are at a conference,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.500
and the previous speaker spoke longer than necessary,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.500
and the general regulations are pressing you,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.500
it is an unpleasant situation.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.500
It is better to finish earlier.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.500
Believe me, the audience will be very grateful to you.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.500
They can rather go for a coffee break and drink coffee

55:34.000 --> 55:36.500
than if you delay the speech.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.500
Then, on the contrary, everyone is very worried

55:40.000 --> 55:42.500
that this person dared to press

55:43.000 --> 55:45.500
on my own internal schedule,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.500
which, in turn, reduces the emotional background.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.500
And we have already said that this is very ineffective.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.500
Therefore, please be careful.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.500
Give less time to the regulations

55:58.000 --> 56:00.500
than it is given at the conference.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.500
Clear language.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.500
Of course, everything you say should be clear to the audience.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.500
Find out the level of your audience.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.500
If you don't know it, speak as clearly as possible.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.500
Use clever terms only if they are necessary.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.500
If you don't know what to do,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.500
be sure to explain what it means.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.500
And the last point is to be interactive.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.500
It is very difficult to listen to a constant lecture.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.500
You listen to me all the time.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.500
I can't ask you anything.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.500
Probably, if you are tired, I understand you.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.500
Why? Because interactivity is the most effective way

56:40.000 --> 56:42.500
to attract attention.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.500
Use some exercises.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.500
The exercises will be rhetorical.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.500
The most important thing is that the person has established this relationship.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.500
He was asked something.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.500
Then he will wake up, wake up from his thoughts,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.500
and concentrate on your speech.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.500
At this moment, it will be easier for you to convey your opinion

57:04.000 --> 57:06.500
and put it in the heads of others.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.500
Repetition.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.500
It is a really great thing.

57:12.500 --> 57:15.000
I can tell you about five different versions of my speech.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.000
Great! Now speak them.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.000
And without a piece of paper.

57:21.500 --> 57:24.000
Look at the words that are difficult for you to pronounce.

57:24.500 --> 57:27.000
Look at what you can remember and what you have already forgotten.

57:27.500 --> 57:30.000
Look at how you feel and how you behave.

57:30.500 --> 57:33.000
Try your speech to the touch of the tongue.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.000
Try how your presentation behaves.

57:36.500 --> 57:39.000
I mean the electronic PowerPoint.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.500
And how you draw on the board.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.500
If this is a responsible event,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.500
take a board and draw everything you draw again.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.500
And speak. Believe me, this is very important.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.500
You will feel much more confident.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.500
And most importantly, you have spoken it alone.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.500
Now find an audience and speak it to the public.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.500
It does not matter to whom you will tell.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.500
At home or at work.

58:05.500 --> 58:08.000
Come to a person and say,

58:08.500 --> 58:11.000
I really care about your opinion.

58:11.500 --> 58:14.000
And he will listen to you carefully.

58:14.500 --> 58:17.000
Here are the main recipes for success.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.000
Use them in difficult and simple situations.

58:20.500 --> 58:23.000
In public speeches or presentations in a working group.

58:23.500 --> 58:26.000
Then the success of your presentation will be achieved.

58:36.500 --> 58:40.000
We have held an effective presentation.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.000
An effective business speech.

58:43.500 --> 58:46.000
After that, we left the space open.

58:46.500 --> 58:49.000
They want to communicate with us.

58:49.500 --> 58:52.000
And we agree on a meeting.

58:52.500 --> 58:55.000
About business conversation.

58:55.500 --> 58:58.000
Business conversation differs from public speech in that

58:58.500 --> 59:01.000
you are standing alone publicly against many.

59:01.500 --> 59:04.000
In business conversation,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.500
most often 2-4 people.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.500
You can talk and discuss.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.500
The form of communication is not a monologue, but a dialogue.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.500
You constantly exchange information.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.500
Your emotional background is more common.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.500
There is a so-called group dynamics.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.500
You interact and exchange fields of your emotions.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.500
More closely than in a group.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.500
And this is very important.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.000
More closely than in a public speech.

59:34.500 --> 59:37.000
The essence of business conversation is somewhat different.

59:37.500 --> 59:40.000
Most often, its result is

59:40.500 --> 59:43.000
the achievement of certain agreements.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.000
Explanation of the further path of development.

59:46.500 --> 59:50.000
Or determination of specific steps in this development

59:50.500 --> 59:53.000
and in general interaction.

59:53.500 --> 59:56.000
For example, in business conversation,

59:56.500 --> 59:59.000
you can talk about the development of a company.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.500
To start a business conversation,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.500
you need to create an emotional background.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.500
And I will say that in this case,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.500
when creating an emotional background,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.500
business conversation is of particular importance.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.500
It is the contact with the eyes.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.500
It is the attention to the interlocutor

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.500
at the earliest stage of your communication.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.500
Remember, your reputation is not so important.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.000
If you show this attention,

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.000
you will show some participation.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.000
You will say kind words, compliments.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.000
Remember, compliments should be specific.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.000
If you show participation in your interlocutor.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.000
On the contrary, it will cause trust.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.000
Your openness will be rewarded with a response openness.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.000
It will be easier for you to understand your interlocutor.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.000
It will be easier for you to understand your interlocutor.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.500
It will be easier for you to understand your interlocutor.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.500
And to clarify his strategies and tactics.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.500
The next stage of business conversation

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.500
is the creation of a unified information field.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.500
To be honest, it's very bad.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.500
If we start a business conversation

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.500
with the following words.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.500
I have this point of view.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.500
I want you to say this and that.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.000
Believe me, it's not effective.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.000
You haven't agreed on the terms yet.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.000
A person can decide that he came here with someone else.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.000
This is what needs to be clarified.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.000
To clarify your goals.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.000
To clarify the goals of your interlocutor.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.000
To clarify his information field.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.000
What does he already know?

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.000
What would he like to bring here?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.500
To clarify your goals.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.500
Your understanding.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.500
Your point of view on the result of the business conversation.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.500
It is very important to agree on the terms in advance.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.500
How much time do you have?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.500
If a person is in a hurry, he will be nervous.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.500
If you talk a lot and for a long time.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.500
If, on the contrary, you are in a hurry,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.500
but you stop the conversation right in the middle.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.000
And your interlocutor wanted to bring some more information to you.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.000
This will offend him.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.000
Believe me, he will not want to talk to you any more.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.000
It will be difficult for you to establish the same good relations

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.000
as before this rapid interruption.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.000
Remember about the restoration of egocentrism.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.000
If you interrupt a person, he feels unnecessary and abandoned.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.000
Do not allow this.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.000
Therefore, the regulations are very important.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.500
Next is responsibility.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.500
Who takes responsibility in this conversation?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.500
Who is the initiator of this conversation?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.500
Who will make the responsible decision?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.500
How is the responsibility distributed between you?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.500
Who cares about the result of this decision?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.500
It is important to discuss this at the very beginning.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.500
Because then it will be difficult to build a discussion

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.500
and build your proposal without clarifying it.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.500
Believe me, very often,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.500
this remains unclear and prevents the agreement.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.500
It leads to conflicts that do not really exist.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.500
Goals are separate.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.500
Goals must be discussed.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.500
First, you need to clarify them for yourself very clearly.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.500
Formulate them on the points.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.500
Write them down. Express them on paper.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.500
And come to an agreement with this.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.500
Then, having discussed them and opened them to your interlocutor,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.000
you need to find out the goal of the interlocutor.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.000
It is also important to start with this.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.000
Because maybe your goals are completely different.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.000
He decided to just look and feel.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.000
And you came to sign a contract.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.000
Be careful and attentive.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.000
You must unite yourself with the information field.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.000
A single information space.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.000
Only in this case, it is possible to achieve the maximum

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.500
mutual result.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.500
That is, a win-win strategy.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.500
Again, if you feel tough in your relationship,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.500
if you are aiming for a conqueror strategy,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.500
especially since you need to find out

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.500
the weak points of your opponent,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.500
you need to understand what he is aiming for

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.500
in order to protect yourself and attack correctly.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.500
The next stage of your business conversation

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.500
is normal, natural interaction.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.500
Explaining the situation and the vision of both partners.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.500
Here I want to say one more very important thing.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.500
The fact is that our point of view,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.500
I actually already mentioned it,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.500
the cognitive picture of the world,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.500
our understanding of the world,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.500
all our installations, all knowledge,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.500
everything that is in our head,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.500
is a very clear structure.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.000
It would be funny if it were not.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.000
The fact is that we need it

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.000
in order to meet the principles of natural selection,

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.000
to be stronger than the situation that is around us.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.000
But if something is trying to shift this cognitive picture of the world,

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.000
there is internal resistance.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.000
If a person was happy with his picture of the world,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.500
why should he change it?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.500
If his state is stable,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.500
then his picture of the world brings him success and stability.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.500
Why should he change it?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.500
Therefore, if you want to apply the process of persuasion,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.500
that is, to apply persuasion tools,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.500
especially emotional pressure,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.500
or informational, or vocal,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.500
to pressure the interlocutor,

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.000
it will cause a lot of internal resistance.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.000
A person will begin to resist even the fact that it will help him a lot,

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.000
and will make him as happy, satisfied, satisfied as possible.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.000
It will help him achieve the same result.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.000
We wonder why this happens.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.000
That is why we came across the internal resistance

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.000
to changing the picture of the world.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:28.000
What to do? First, to clarify this picture for yourself as much as possible.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.500
To make sure that what you offer your interlocutor

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.500
is not a displacement of this picture,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.500
but an intensification and deepening of it.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.500
In fact, very often it is just a matter of terms,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.500
and it is just a matter of posing the question.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.500
Therefore, very often the same thing can be expressed in different words,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.500
and by saying it in the language of your interlocutor,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.500
you will achieve more than,

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.000
say, in your own language,

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.000
in the language of your own concepts,

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.000
in the language of your picture of the world.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.000
Therefore, at the stage of clarifying the situation,

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.000
be sure to pay more attention to clarifying the vision of the partner.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.000
This will tell you about an effective communicator,

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.000
and only in this case you will hold the situation in your own hands.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.000
Because the situation is not in your hands,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.500
but in the hands of the one who listens,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.500
the one who knows the other.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.500
The next stage of the negotiations and business conversation in general

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.500
is the clarification of hidden factors.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.500
This is very important.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.500
What is on the surface, what you were told,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.500
what you decided to open,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.500
it is not always all that you have in your hands.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.000
What you were told, what you decided to open,

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.000
it is not always all that you have in your hands.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.000
You must be prepared for this stage in detail.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.000
You need to make a list of pre-structured questions

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.000
that will clarify all the elements of the position,

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.000
and not only those that your interlocutor decided to open for you.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.000
Agree, he certainly told you about all the strong sides of his ideas,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.500
the positions of his business result.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.500
Now you are interested in learning all the sides, including the weak ones.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.500
There are structured interview tools.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.500
But, in short, you just need to ask a lot of different questions in detail.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.500
In detail.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.500
See what questions are inconvenient for the interlocutor.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.500
Establish an emotional background and continue to ask about it.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.000
Believe me, this will clarify a lot for you.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.000
Similarly, if you feel that your interlocutor is in doubt,

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.000
feels some internal objection,

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.000
be sure to show it at this stage.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.000
So tell me, objectivation, what do you feel?

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.000
It seems to me that you feel irritation.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.000
Let's talk about it. Why do you feel irritation?

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.000
It is very important that there is no internal resistance to your words,

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.000
to the presentation of your idea.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.000
And in the same way, if you feel your doubts, your objections,

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.000
do not be afraid to talk about them.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.000
Your interlocutor has subconsciously felt them.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.000
But if you do not show them, he can take them into account.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:40.000
He may think that they are much stronger than they really are.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.500
He may start to press you because he is afraid of this resistance.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.500
This can prevent you from having confidence.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.500
Therefore, it is very important to show your doubts and objections.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.500
Do not be afraid to do it.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.500
You do not look stupid when asking questions.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.500
You look stupid when you do not understand and establish agreements.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.000
The next step is to create a single approach to solving the problem.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.000
The sequence of these three stages is very important.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.000
At the beginning, the situation is clarified.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:24.000
It is clear what is common and what is the difference between your positions.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:29.000
Then the inner hidden factor is clarified.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.000
And only then is the creation of a single approach.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.500
At this stage, a very common mistake is to go into a strategy of compromise.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.500
It seems that you already had a strategy of unification.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.500
You listened to your partner, you understood his point of view.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.500
But here you remain in the same plane.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.500
The plane of your thoughts.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.500
Or you begin to plunge into the plane of the thoughts and understanding of the interlocutor.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.000
Again, a flat position.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.000
Like a razor, which is very sharp, but very fragile.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.000
It is very important to find a third plane.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.000
Which is both a system and another.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.000
This is very convenient to do in business games.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:20.000
After training in simplified situations, it is easier for you to do this in reality.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.000
Why?

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.000
Because the isolated situation seems easier.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.500
Because the isolated situation seems easier because it is less responsible.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.500
At work, plunging into responsibility, plunging into dependence on the situation,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.500
it is very difficult to get up on it.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.500
To find a third plane, a third responsibility.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.500
But this is really very important when making a joint decision.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.500
Believe me, the most interesting business decisions, the most effective successes

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:55.000
were achieved when there was a third plane of the two-way solution.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.000
And the last stage is the confirmation of agreements.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.000
This is very important.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:08.000
Because you found a joint decision, you overcame all resistance.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.000
You effectively found a common universe of your result.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.000
But the meeting can end in nothing.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.000
Why?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.500
Because your decision is not recorded and not confirmed by specific documents.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.500
This can affect the sales process.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.500
When a person is ready to buy, but the check is not issued, he can leave the store.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.500
This also applies to the stages of negotiations.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.500
When it is said, yes, everything is very wonderful and good, thank you, thank you, we will meet again.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.500
This is not good luck.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.500
Good luck when you have clearly agreed on what you will do next.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.500
You have completely agreed on your further actions.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.500
It is best if all this is confirmed in a documentary.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.500
It is interesting that if you are not ready to sign the papers, you can just record it by hand.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.500
See what your interlocutor recorded.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:13.500
In this case, the subconscious understanding that what is written with a pen cannot be cut out with an ax will be useful to you.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:18.000
Be sure to write it down in front of your interlocutor.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.000
This will confirm your intention.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.000
This will help you create a common space for further actions.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.000
Group discussion.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.000
Do you feel it is already more difficult?

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.000
Normal, successful negotiations.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.000
Normal business communication at meetings.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.000
Normal business communication just at workplaces.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.500
Good. But what if the points of view are different?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.500
And maybe some negotiations ended only with clarifying positions or clarifying some space for interaction.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.500
But you need to find a common solution, a new solution.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.500
This slide shows a group discussion.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.500
In fact, the same sequence for a brainstorming.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.500
What is the difference?

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.000
The difference is that in the discussion people have worked out their positions in advance.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:19.000
They have already come up with some ready-made materials and understanding of the task.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.000
A new one is born right away in a brainstorming.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.000
In the process of clarification, I will say what is different and how.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.000
But in fact, these tools seem to be very simple.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.000
They always work.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.500
Many of my clients said,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.500
Ha, brainstorming, you will teach us brainstorming.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.500
We know this, this tool is not very effective.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.500
It is old and does not work.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.500
In fact, now I will talk about those nuances that will allow you to make this tool effective as it is.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.500
Because nothing has been invented better.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.500
Everything else is more specific, small and not so effective details.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.000
Or variants of the same brainstorming.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.000
The discussion is fundamentally different.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:14.000
Just at one stage there is no new appearance, but there is a preparation of a ready-made solution.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.000
Let's move on to the points.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.000
The first point is to appoint a host.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.000
He is the most important.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.000
He is most often missed.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:29.000
Believe me, it is very important, both in the discussion and in the brainstorming.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.500
Although, it seems to be different things.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.500
It is necessary that there is a host.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.500
Why?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.500
This is a person who is not involved.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.500
Still, any of us who offers a solution to a problem in this discussion,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.500
who is involved, he is emotionally interested.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.500
Always in any discussions, whether you want it or not, the emotional background will rise.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.500
That is, he is not positive, but just brighter, stronger.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.000
Therefore, the host is a person who is emotionally not interested.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:08.000
He does not offer his solution and does not participate in the discussion process.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.000
He only monitors the advertising.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.000
Therefore, if you are interested in the country and want to offer your solution,

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.000
let someone offer it for you.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:24.000
Or better yet, find a host who is really not interested in the results of this discussion or brainstorming.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.000
So what does the host do?

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:36.000
He follows the rules and the golden rules that lead you to the result.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.000
Then believe me, you will succeed.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:45.000
I was hired to a team that could not come to a single opinion.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.000
They discussed for many hours and days.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.000
The total amount exceeded 30 hours of discussion.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.000
We met and decided everything in two hours.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.500
With the help of these golden rules.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.500
I was a host.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.500
The next point. Where do we start?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.500
We discuss the subject of discussion in detail.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.500
We set a task.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.500
We agree on the rules.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.500
How much, who and what says.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.500
If the host is a professional, he can do it himself during the discussion.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.500
But it is best to say it so that there is no offense.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.500
I was not listened to, but he spoke for so long, and I want to speak for so long, but I was interrupted.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.500
Please, let's talk.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.500
First, do not interrupt.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.500
Second, follow the rules.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.500
Rules 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 20 minutes.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.500
Depending on what you want to hear.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.500
I would not advise to make rules more than 5-7 minutes.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.500
Many 10 minutes of each speech.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.500
People get tired, they lose their understanding.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.500
Confused information is more difficult to perceive.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.500
And the main thing is more difficult to compare.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.000
So it's better to be brief.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:00.000
Believe me, with brief information, everything will be much easier.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.000
You will convey better and will look more confident.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.000
Great.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:11.000
We stated the topic, discussed the rules, talked about how everything will go.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.000
The next step.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.000
The stage of specific work.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.000
We offer a solution.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.000
At the discussion, we offer our worked out options.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.000
And on the brainstorming, we create new.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.000
And here is the difference.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:31.000
All these options need to be recorded in advance.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.000
There must be a protocol.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.000
The host can deal with the protocol, or it is conducted separately.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:44.000
In the case of a discussion, participants can bring their opinions in advance.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.000
And give them to others.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.000
In this case, it is better to structure them clearly.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.000
And do not overload with unnecessary information.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.500
In a brainstorming, it is very difficult to start.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.500
The first solution will not appear.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.500
What slogan will we choose for the new product?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.500
There are no options.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.500
What to do?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.500
Right. Just to arrange the stream of thinking.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.500
Our brain must get used to the creative situation.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.500
Therefore, you call any concepts, what you see around.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:31.000
For example, a chair, a table, a wall, a ceiling, a lamp, a red tie, a striped tie, a pen, a piece of paper.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.000
We call it.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.000
And we record it.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.000
Everything is serious.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.000
We record it in the protocol.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:45.000
After a while, the name of what we see, just some vague concepts,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.500
ideas will begin to appear.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.500
Real ideas.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.500
We continue to record them.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.500
At first, the ideas are empty.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.500
And you want to criticize.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.500
In general, you want to criticize someone else's ideas.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.500
You understand why I already talked about it.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.500
Because someone else's idea is not mine.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.500
Because if I understood that this idea is better, then it would already be mine.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.500
Therefore, my cognitive picture of the world is that my idea is better.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.000
Therefore, it is very difficult for us to accept someone else's idea.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:20.000
Therefore, at this stage of discussion and brainstorming,

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.000
the most important thing is why the host should follow.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.000
Not a single word of criticism, especially criticism, should be spoken.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.000
Only the generation of ideas.

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.000
Only the release of information.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.000
And no discussion.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.000
Sometimes you have to be tough enough.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.500
Because you really want to start right away.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.500
To be honest, I myself always want to say what is wrong with any idea when I participate in a brainstorming.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.500
But you need to restrain yourself.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.500
Accept it as it is.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.500
As a normal reaction of our psyche.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.500
And consider that we will discuss it all later.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.500
And discuss.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.500
When you have recorded a sufficient number of ideas,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.500
I am asked when to finish, especially in a brainstorming.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.000
In fact, there will be a stage when ideas suddenly stop appearing.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.000
You need to wait for it.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.000
The second breath will come.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.000
Write down more ideas.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.000
And after a while you will stop yourself.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.000
Most often it is half an hour.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:25.000
Never more than an hour there is a brainstorming of new ideas.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.000
Therefore, in any case, 20 minutes, half an hour,

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.000
we must tell you that the ideas have stopped.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.000
But if they do not stop, continue to record further.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.500
Continue to create until they go away.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.500
Until they go away.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.500
Until you feel this state.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.500
That you are empty.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.500
You gave everything that was in your right creative sphere.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.500
You can say so.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.500
And discussions.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.500
All points of view are heard.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.500
All points of view are conveyed.

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.000
At this stage, especially in a discussion,

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:07.000
it is very important to use the tool of paraphrasing.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.000
That is, the understanding of what the interlocutor said.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.000
The correct explanation.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.000
If you describe his point of view with your own words,

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.000
will it remain the same?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.000
This is very important.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.000
Because often it seems to us that we understand what the interlocutor says.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:29.000
But in fact, in these words we put in a completely different meaning.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.000
Remember the tool of paraphrasing.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.000
And only after you have understood,

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.000
after you have heard what you understood correctly,

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:44.000
after your ideas in the brainstorm have gone,

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:51.000
after you have recorded everything that was born in you,

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.000
everything that you said in public.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.000
Only after that can you proceed to the discussion.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.500
You know, it often happens that in the beginning of a brainstorming,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.500
you want to criticize ideas.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.500
But then it turns out that the best result of this brainstorming

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.500
will be the unification of several ideas at once.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.500
Maybe even all.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.500
You can combine ideas.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.500
You can find a common solution.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.500
In the same way, you can choose the best solution.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.500
If a lot of people participate in a brainstorming or discussion,

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:28.000
it often happens that there is no principled limitation in the group.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.000
There are even special tools that allow

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.000
to conduct it in very large audiences.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:39.000
So, if a discussion is held in a large group, you can vote.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.000
You can vote as we vote for the president.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.000
Not in one round, but in two.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.000
It is even more useful if there are many ideas and many proposals for discussions.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.500
It will be easier for people to choose from a dozen, two or three,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.500
which they liked, to vote for them.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.500
And then, by a common decision, to find a five or three

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.500
in which you can vote only for one option.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.500
And in this case, the best solution is chosen.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.500
It is important here that there are dissatisfied people.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:18.000
There are people who voted for not one of the solutions that he proposed.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.000
But this is a law, and the leader should reassure such a person.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.000
The law of the majority.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.000
Indeed, the majority cannot be wrong.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.000
If a person wants to add something,

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:34.000
wants to add something to this vote, he can speak.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.000
And this can be done during a discussion.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.000
If you do it before and between the votes,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.500
then, according to a certain regulation, he can come out and say his yes and his no,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.500
as in the English Parliament.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.500
First, there is a point of view,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.500
then a minute for, a minute against, a minute of his arguments are spoken,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.500
and after that he votes.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.500
You can use such a sequence.

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:08.000
It is necessary to hear all points of view,

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:12.000
so that there is no resentment, so that there is no opposition,

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.000
so that a person agrees to the next stage.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.000
This is the protocol of the decision, the signing of the decision.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.000
It is very important to consolidate the decision,

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:27.000
so that all participants in the discussion, all participants in the brainstorming,

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.000
agree with the decision.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.000
Because otherwise it loses meaning.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.500
This is the burning of unnecessary conflicts, unnecessary tense relations.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.500
This is a condition, it is necessary to discuss it at the beginning,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.500
when clarifying the subject, discussing the regulations and the like.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.500
This must be done.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.500
Therefore, if a person is heard, if he has spoken out his objections at the previous stage,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.500
but they were not perceived and were not taken seriously,

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:06.000
it is his choice to propose, and it is the choice of others to reject his proposal.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:10.000
Each person will be ready for the next decision,

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:14.000
if all the regulations and all the rules are observed.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.000
Then the decision is taken.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.000
Usually I do not advise to change it, because there are such tendencies,

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.000
that at first everything is accepted, then someone goes on a business trip,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.500
or some people leave the business trip, those who came,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.500
and everything begins to be reworked, to be redone.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.500
Therefore, it is very important to conclude a written agreement,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.500
at least in the form of a business meeting protocol.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.500
And that's it. The decision is made, it is found,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.500
quite quickly, the inner picture of the world has not affected everyone.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:58.000
And the feeling of confidence in yourself has not suffered, because everyone is heard.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:04.000
And of course you have a choice to make your decision or not to make your decision.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.000
Thus, the emotional background is preserved.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.000
But it is better to note this decision, at least a little, at least coffee,

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:20.000
or some sweets, or a croissant, if you discuss very serious creative moments.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.500
It is necessary to note, to emotionally reinforce the creation of a new result.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.500
Believe me, it will help you to work on it further,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.500
and to smooth out some unclear moments, conflicts.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.500
An interesting combination, right?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.500
Indeed, we move from natural, comfortable business communication,

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.000
when you are in a favorable atmosphere for you,

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.000
when the emotional background is verified,

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.000
and all attention is paid to the information component.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.000
But it does not always happen.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:08.000
And we are dealing with the first form of complex communications,

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.000
complex business relations, these are conflicts.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.000
Agree that this happens.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:22.000
The first recipe for dealing with a conflict is to accept that it really exists.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.000
What is a conflict?

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:32.000
I would like not to give a specific definition, a simple one,

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.000
what is a conflict in general.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:40.000
A conflict, by and large, is, of course, a confrontation of sides.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.500
A conflict is a situation when the sides cannot reach an agreement.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.500
A conflict is a situation when the emotional background is falling.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.500
But in fact, this is not a definition of a conflict.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.500
Why? Because it is very important what kind of conflict it is, what its appearance is.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.500
In fact, the main conflict, why it happens,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.500
and it would be great if all conflicts were exactly like this,

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.000
but in reality, these are conflicts of interests.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.000
Your interests collide.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:23.000
They collide so seriously that it is difficult to find a common platform, a common space for interaction.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:29.000
Two of your tasks do not overlap, do not combine.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:36.000
Two of the results visible to you and your opponent.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.500
Business result.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.500
Great.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.500
It would seem that the effective ways of interaction that we have discussed allow to achieve the result.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.500
It would seem that it is important to delve into the opinion of the interlocutor,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.500
to establish an emotional background and to find a third space combining these two results.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.500
However, it happens that it would seem that the space is easy to find.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.500
Well, not easy, but possible.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.500
It would seem that everything is there, but nevertheless, the conflict, especially its emotional phase,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.500
is only emphasized, only intensified.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.500
And even a brain storm, which is effectively carried out,

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.500
still cannot remove all the negative emotional load.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:38.000
Especially it is important in a team, in a working group, when the atmosphere becomes unbearable.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:43.000
People can leave, or at least they stop working.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.000
Who wants to work in a situation of constant tension?

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:55.000
All the internal resources of a person are spent on internal tension and protection from negative waves of conflict.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:58.000
Why does this happen?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:05.500
Why is there a conflict of interests that can be resolved by means of communication techniques?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.500
Why do conflicts arise that are not resolved?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.500
In fact, there are many answers.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.500
But the most important one, which I want to pay special attention to today, is one.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.500
This answer is that it is much more important to talk about internal conflicts than external ones.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:35.000
Oddly enough, most conflicts that occur at work are not caused by external factors.

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:41.000
We believe that the causes of conflict are outside of us, in the situation that has arisen,

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:47.000
in the surrounding conditions that have arisen, in the informational space, in other words.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.000
Or inside another person who is to blame, who does not want to understand us,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.500
who does something wrong, not what suits us.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:04.500
But in fact, most of the conflicts that we come across at home and at work are inside of us.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.500
And if there were no conflicts inside of us, there would be none outside of us.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.500
Outside there would be just interaction and space for choice.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:21.500
To agree or to remain alone inside one's own universe.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.500
To unite one's own universe.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.500
Great! What is wrong in our universe? Why do we have this conflict inside of us?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.500
In fact, internal conflict is a very interesting system.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.500
How is internal conflict formed?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.500
A difficult and negative situation arises for you, related to communication.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:53.000
You experience negative emotions. You may experience resentment or aggression.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.000
You may experience pain or humiliation.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:01.000
The main emotion is negative and the main situation has no way out,

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:06.000
no concrete way out at the moment when you experience it.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.000
But the situation goes on.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.000
Negative emotions are gradually being smoothed out.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:16.000
We say so in everyday life. They are gradually being smoothed out.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.500
But in fact, they remain inside of us.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.500
Psychologists say that it is like windows of Windows.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.500
We open a window, then we open another window, then another one,

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.500
and in the end there are so many open windows that all the system's resources

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.500
go to support information in these open windows.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.500
And there are no resources left for anything else.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.000
The same is true for our psyche.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:50.000
After opening one conflict, after ending communication with negative emotions,

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.000
we leave this open conflict inside of us.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:34:00.000
The fact that it is gradually being forgotten, that negative emotions are gradually fading away,

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:05.000
says only one thing. This conflict is being submerged inside our subconscious.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.000
It is being blocked by other windows.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.500
But in fact, it remains. It remains to use the resources of our psyche.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.500
The abundance of such unfinished conflicts is wasting our energy.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.500
A person does not have the opportunity to actively, energetically develop himself,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.500
to realize the business goals of his company.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.500
What should he do? He should work through his conflicts.

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:38.000
He should not be afraid to experience them again and again.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.000
It is interesting that you can experience it with a psychologist.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:48.000
You can remember and resolve it on your own.

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:52.000
I offer you tools for this.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:58.000
But in the same way, if this does not happen, if you leave these conflicts submerged,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.500
the most interesting thing is that they not only waste your resources,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.500
your emotions, your inner life forces,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.500
but also your subconscious tries to resolve it,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.500
tries to show it to you, even if you want to forget it.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.500
Therefore, as soon as the situation of your communication begins to remind you

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.500
of the situation of that old, acute conflict,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.500
it manifests itself again as a chronic disease.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.500
You feel that you are in the same, very similar,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.500
or at least approximately similar scenarios of conflict,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.500
as if you play the same roles, or at least you play the same play,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.500
even from different sides.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.500
This means that this is your inner conflict.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.500
The cause of the conflict is not in the surrounding details,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.500
not in the information surrounding you, but inside you.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.000
Therefore, please, this is the most important thing.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:03.000
Believe me, when there is a difficult communication task in front of a top manager,

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.000
he invites me to help him in his decision.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:11.000
Very often it happens that you only need to relieve the internal tension,

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.000
relieve the internal clutches and conflicts,

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:19.000
and there is no need to dictate the search for a solution to this task to a person,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.500
because a leader and a successful businessman can solve any task,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.500
including communication.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.500
It's not a problem.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.500
The main thing is to deal with the inner harmony and understanding

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.500
that your integrity is the key to the success of the integrity of the environment,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.500
including the integrity of decision-making,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.500
harmony in the relations around it,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.500
and easy and effective communication.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.500
It is much easier to solve your external conflicts of interest.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.500
They go into the phase of discussion and search for new solutions.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.500
It is interesting that harmony in you is projected on the surrounding people,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.500
and you do not allow yourself to be involved in the conflict scenario.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.500
It is enough that you have worked out your conflicts.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.000
The surrounding people will not be able to play their games,

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:23.000
and you will really discuss the issue effectively.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:29.000
Another very interesting option of complex communication is manipulation.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:36.000
Manipulation training is often called the art of protection manipulation.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:41.000
As if no one wants to manipulate, and everyone wants to protect themselves from manipulation.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.500
But if everyone wants to protect themselves, then who manipulates us?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.500
Let's be honest.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:57.500
Sometimes during negotiations you would like to influence the understanding

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:05.500
and motives of your interlocutor, that is, the cognitive picture of the world.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.500
You would like to do it imperceptibly and very simply.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:17.000
You do not use big and complex skills and tools of effective communication.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:21.000
Simply put, if you have manipulated, everything works out.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.000
Manipulation has one big drawback.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:30.000
When a person leaves your field of information and emotional field,

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:38.000
he remains with himself, he begins to digest this situation even subconsciously,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.500
and gradually your instructions are washed out of his brain.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.500
The very concept of manipulation is washed out.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.500
Manipulation is a complete replacement of the interlocutor's goals with your goals.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.500
You do it not aggressively, not pressing, but gradually and carefully.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:08.000
For example, the Eastern parable.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:17.000
Even one person can bring a horse to the well, but forty will not force her to drink.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:22.000
So if you forcefully grab the horse's head and put it in the well,

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:26.000
she will start to choke, and after a while she will swallow the water.

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.000
This is a compulsion.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.500
And if you give her a piece of salt or make her run around the circle with it,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.500
she will want to drink after a while.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.500
This is exactly what manipulation will be.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.500
It is very important to understand that the horse will not lick the salt again next time.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.500
Next time she will refuse to run around the circle,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.500
because she will realize that this is done only to make her drink.

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:58.000
And if the horse does not intend to drink, she will not force her to drink next time.

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.000
Therefore, manipulation is a very short-term technique.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.000
Remember this.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.000
For long-term cooperation, the strategy of win-win, the unification of results, is important.

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.000
Nevertheless, let's analyze the basic types of manipulation.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:19.000
Experienced specialists believe that there are two most effective types of manipulation.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.000
The first manipulation is the sale of the future.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:28.000
As we all know, many politicians use it very effectively.

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:36.000
Indeed, if you put in people's heads that there is a future much better than their own future,

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.000
it is very easy to manage them.

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.000
Do it this way and you will be happy.

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:43.000
Call us and you will get 1 million rubles.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.000
Great!

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.000
A good way of manipulation.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.000
The next way of manipulation, which is just as effective, is the use of weaknesses.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.500
Everyone knows it.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.500
And how to protect yourself from this?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.500
It is quite obvious.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.500
We know the effective ways of manipulation.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.500
We know how to protect ourselves from them.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.500
From the sale of the future, the protection of your own future.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.500
The making of your own strategy of development.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.500
The making of your own personal strategy of development.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.500
Because prepare for the fact that in business communications,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.500
you can be manipulated as a personality.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.500
The making of your corporate strategy.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.500
Understanding where you are going, what you are ready for, what you are not ready for.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.500
If you have a clear understanding of your future,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.500
then such manipulation, the offering of some super image of the future,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.500
you are not in danger.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.500
At least it will make you think.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.500
To move to the meeting to think over it.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.500
Manipulators do not like this kind of thing.

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:52.000
Because it leads to the absence of all their attempts to control you.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:56.000
Next, the game of weaknesses.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.000
For example, blackmail.

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.000
One of the examples of manipulation.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.000
They know your weaknesses.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:09.000
And public disclosure of weaknesses is the essence of blackmail.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.000
What to do?

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.000
To know your weaknesses and to accept them as they are.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.500
It is very interesting that there is a conversation about your weaknesses,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.500
which is started by manipulators,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:29.500
somewhere a little bit from the side, a little bit from afar.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.500
And suddenly a sharp, quick question is thrown at you.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.500
Such questions are called stressful.

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:44.000
For example, it can even concern some of your own physiology.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.000
For example, you may be asked, why don't you use a deodorant?

01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:51.000
It would seem a stupid question, insulting.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:56.000
That's why you were offended, you are already blushed, you are in shock.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.000
You are not ready for such a question.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:04.000
You feel embarrassed, because it is indeed indecent and uncomfortable.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.500
And at this moment, any ideas can come to your mind.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.500
You are open to the influence of some kind of hypnosis.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.500
Be careful.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.500
Accept yourself as you are.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.500
Accept all weaknesses as natural for you.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.500
Accept your weaknesses as you need them, because in fact we have no weaknesses.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:35.000
We have constructively demanded and not demanded qualities in our body.

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:39.000
All our weaknesses are those qualities that are not constructively demanded.

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.000
For example, communicability.

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:45.000
It is very important for a business coach and not for an archivist at all.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.000
They will say about an archivist, he is some kind of a timid.

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:52.000
They will say about a business coach, he has effective communication skills.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:01.500
If you feel that you are slowly being zombified, for example, we talked about a state of shock.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.500
A very good tool is muscle tone.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.500
You can even start waving your hands.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.500
You can get up, walk sharply.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.500
You can do something, distract yourself.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.500
If there is no such opportunity, you can strain all the muscles of the body as much as possible.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.000
This will also help to distract.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:27.000
The main thing is not to give in to relaxation, a little sleepy, and to a restless state.

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:34.000
Because this is the most beneficial state for imposing your own ideas,

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.000
as manipulation, as hypnosis.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.000
Classic and non-classic.

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.000
In other words, you know your future.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.000
You know your weaknesses.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.500
You are protected from manipulation.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.500
Complex communication.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.500
The last type.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.500
Probably the most emotionally expensive.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.500
These are tough negotiations.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.500
I will not talk about how to have tough conversations.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.000
There is an interesting test in the distribution tool.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.000
Are you ready for tough negotiations?

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.000
Please go through it.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:27.000
I will say this now to those who have not passed the test.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:31.000
For whom are tough negotiations really tough?

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.000
Who does not feel their natural state?

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:40.000
It is then that negotiations are called tough.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.500
These are the negotiations in which you emotionally burn out.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.500
Which are emotionally expensive for us.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.500
You experience negative emotions that have consequences after the negotiations.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.500
Let's say it's hard for you to start the next one.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.500
What to do to avoid this?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.500
There are 5 mandatory points that need to be fulfilled.

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.000
I will tell you about them.

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.000
Look carefully.

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.000
If the negotiations have become tough for you,

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:19.000
then one of these points is not fulfilled.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:24.000
The first point of the negotiation is especially important for women.

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.000
This is readiness for tough negotiations.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.000
For a man, the situation is natural.

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:33.000
For a woman, it is strange.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.000
Our genetic memory, our ancient brain,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.500
does not understand this situation in relation to women.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.500
Tough negotiations are a war that has already reached my home.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.500
It's bad. You need to run away or pretend to be dead.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.500
Then they will not notice.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.500
Therefore, many women are put in a stupor in a situation of tough negotiations.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.500
Or the desire to run away.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.500
They try to avoid or try to postpone the meeting.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.500
What to do?

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.000
Yes, tough negotiations exist.

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.000
Yes, they exist.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:12.000
Yes, I am ready to act.

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:16.000
Yes, I am now in a manly and tough role of a duel.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.000
Yes, it is so.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.000
I am a strong woman and I can handle it.

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:25.000
The next point is a clear orientation to the result.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.000
This is important.

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.000
We have been talking for a long time about emotional background,

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.000
information component.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.500
It should be both.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.500
At the beginning we said that business negotiations are aimed at the result.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.500
But very often we want to please the interlocutor.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.500
We want to make the result fulfilled.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.500
We look very decent and worthy,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.500
very nice people or very fair people,

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:03.000
or very moral people or very ethical people.

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.000
As you wish.

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:08.000
Each has its own qualities.

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.000
The point is that in the case of tough negotiations

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:19.000
you need to focus exclusively on the result.

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.000
No relations.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:26.000
The person who talks to you is only a tool, not a personality.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.000
Remember we talked about the tactics of interaction.

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:35.000
Here the role approach is very interesting and necessary.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:40.000
Because you do not put the person in front of you as a personality.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.000
You do not treat him as a personality.

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:47.000
You treat him as a specific tool in a specific role.

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.000
This is the only way to protect yourself from pressure.

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:56.000
There are options when you put only relations in the first place.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.500
Then only relations.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.500
Then no result.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.500
You do everything to create effective relations and completely bend.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.500
Your result is zero.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.500
But the result of the relationship is 100%.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.500
Let's move on.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.500
To show activity.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.500
An interesting point.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.500
I often ask in training.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.500
What do you do in case of an attack?

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.000
And most often I am told.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.000
I run away.

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.000
Or I start hitting in the face.

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.000
Or I start calling the police.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.000
A million ways.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.000
Very few people ask.

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.000
Who attacks?

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:42.000
Me or the opponent?

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.000
In other words, in our moral society.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.000
Christian society.

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.000
Muslim society.

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.000
In the Buddhist society, especially.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.500
It is believed that aggression is not very human.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.500
This is not a very good quality.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.500
Therefore, in any case, I will not attack anyone.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.500
Therefore, in a situation of tough negotiations, it is difficult for us to find out.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.500
It is difficult to think through the attack tool, not the defense tool.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.500
But remember, the attack is the best defense.

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.000
Therefore, be active.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.000
Think about your active position.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.000
For example.

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:34.000
A very effective tool for tough negotiations is to create an uncomfortable atmosphere for the second participant.

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:37.000
You will be put in a very uncomfortable chair.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.000
Or they will start smoking, letting the smoke into your face.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.000
Or you will sit on a draft.

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:45.000
Or with your eyes straight into the bright sun.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.500
Something will be standing on the table in front of you, which will interfere with the review or some comfortable seat.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.500
I was once at a negotiation, when a huge screen with news was working behind my back.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.500
I could not see them, but the general director who communicated with me was watching them all the time.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.500
What is best to do?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.500
The best thing is to take the activity into your own hands.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.500
Move unnecessary things off the table.

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.000
To sit down.

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.000
To say, you know, I want to sit down, I'm being blown away.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:20.000
To ask to take a break in smoking.

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:23.000
And I then asked to turn off the screen.

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:27.000
I said, you know, let's look together, and then we will negotiate.

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:30.000
The next point is generally very important.

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:33.000
Why? Because most of us with higher education.

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:36.000
Many with two, many with three.

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:39.000
And for sure all of them studied at school for 10 years.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.500
Therefore, it is very easy to put us in a situation, it was very significant for us, emotionally significant.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.500
Remember I was talking about the scenarios and plays of our conflicts?

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.500
Here is a similar situation with exams.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.500
We do not like them very much and are very nervous.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.500
For us, this situation is very disturbing and uncomfortable.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.500
And here we are at negotiations, it is very easy to put us in this scenario.

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:10.000
In front of you sits an examiner, and you answer him on the ticket.

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:18.000
You are introduced into this scenario, assessing you, assessing your actions or your qualities.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.000
And you immediately begin to give in.

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:27.000
You start to suffer, because every next question you find the answer with difficulty.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.000
Why with difficulty? Because there is a hesitation.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.500
And there is an understanding that there is a correct answer, but you do not know the correct answer.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.500
It is known by your examiner.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.500
And you are not sure in everything you say, because you are not sure whether this answer says what the examiner needs.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.500
A terrible situation.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.500
But remember that you have already passed all the exams in your life.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.500
You are ready and you are experts.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.500
Maximally experts.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.500
Otherwise, you would not be sitting in this place.

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:59.000
Therefore, everything you say is correct.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:04.000
And the era of incorrect answers is already in the past.

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.000
When it is especially difficult.

01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.000
When you are emotionally involved.

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.000
When you are being deceived.

01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:18.000
Remember, in any films about good and bad heroes, the good one is often deceived.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:26.500
He is being insulted and thus destroys the whole strategy of victory.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.500
This is the last point.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.500
If you do not want to be insulted or to be caught in a trap,

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.500
speaking in plain language,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.500
be detached, play a role.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.500
Remember, we talked about role tactics.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.500
It's not you, but some role.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.500
Choose the most effective role for the long-term situation.

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.000
But be detached personally.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:51.000
You will become as if higher and from the side.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:58.000
Or as if you walk around the table where the negotiations are taking place and listen.

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.000
You just play a role.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.000
The insults that happen are not for you.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.000
It's not about you.

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.000
It's about this role.

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.000
You will still get out.

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:12.000
And it's not you anymore, because you are not involved personally.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.500
There are special tools that allow you to improve.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.500
They are in our staff.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.500
If all 5 conditions are met, your negotiations stop being tough.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.500
Remember the negotiations in which you were emotionally involved.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.500
Understand which of the points is failed.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.500
Work it out before the next negotiations.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.500
And everything will be as successful as possible.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:40.000
We leave the difficult situations.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:43.000
We have worked out the main types of difficult situations.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:51.000
Now the situation is not less difficult, but it should be the most constructive.

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.000
In training, I say,

01:54:53.500 --> 01:55:04.000
criticism is a feeling that makes you want to act.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.500
It makes you feel up.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.500
Your wings are spreading.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.500
You are ready to do more, more effective and better.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.500
I am told, it's not true.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.500
We have never faced such criticism.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.500
In this case, I answer, you just did not face criticism.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.500
You faced criticism.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.500
In fact, it is a very difficult communication task to give a competent feedback.

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:35.000
We can not talk for a long time.

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:40.000
But we will analyze the simplest example and the simplest tool.

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:48.000
It will allow you to accept any criticism and turn it into effective criticism.

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.000
And vice versa, to give effective criticism to your subordinates.

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:57.000
What is the fundamental difference between criticism and criticism?

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.000
Emotions are negative and positive.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.500
Well, but in fact, there is a main difference in the essence of the content.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.500
Criticism says that it is bad.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.500
This report is not good anywhere.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.500
The varnish on your nails is terrible.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.500
And it pushes away the people around.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.500
And criticism says that it needs to be added or changed.

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:31.000
You know, I saw a nail polish in a nearby store.

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.000
It suits you so much, I would recommend you to buy it.

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.000
This report is great.

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:40.000
I would like to add one more chapter.

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:44.000
And in this chapter, change, rearrange the accents.

01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:48.000
If criticism is so much more effective and pleasant to criticize,

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.000
why is it that most often a person criticizes?

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:55.000
Why is it that very rarely the tool of criticism is used intuitively?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.500
I can answer.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.500
The thing is, again, inside of us.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:09.500
A person likes to criticize exactly the person who criticizes himself for something.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.500
Who sees a lot of negative qualities in himself.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.500
And here's the strange thing.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.500
Such a characteristic of criticism, he begins to see these negative qualities of others in everyone around him.

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.000
Remember the projection device.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.000
And he begins to scold others for it.

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.000
And he scolds, of course, he does not show the path of development.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:39.000
If he had seen his own development, he would not have this negative quality.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.000
And then he would praise everyone around him.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:45.000
So he tells everyone what he is really bad.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:50.000
Therefore, if your leadership scolds you that you are late again,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.500
think about it, it always comes in time.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.500
And vice versa.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.500
If you ever say something to someone that he is bad,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.500
thereby you are writing off in your own shortcomings.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.500
Be careful.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.500
It is especially important when you have a very clear hierarchical difference.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.500
And it is rigidly established.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.500
Well, for example, you and your children.

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:20.000
It is easy to scold children, they can not answer anything back.

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:23.000
Therefore, just a good test.

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:26.000
What are your negative qualities?

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.000
Remember what you said yesterday.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:31.000
And for what you scolded your children.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:36.000
How to learn positive feedback?

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.000
Very simple.

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:44.000
You decide what is bad, but do not tell it to your subordinate or your colleague.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.500
Tell them exactly what you would like to change and what you would like to add.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.500
In this case, everyone will be happy.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.500
A person will see new ways of development.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.500
He will be supported by you.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.500
His self-esteem will only increase, but it will not fall.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.500
Work on it.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.500
But do not sign up for your own shortcomings, you must agree.

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:17.000
We talked about everything that seemed important to me in establishing effective business relations.

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:22.000
This is a systematic approach to strategy.

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:27.000
These are different types of specific tactics in business relations.

01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:32.000
This is a certain multilayeredness of business relations.

01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:36.000
And this must be understood, otherwise everything loses its meaning.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.500
This is emotional and informational content, their sequence.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.500
This is how to master, how to manage these layers, informational and emotional.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.500
What are the types of business relations?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.500
The secret of success in each of them.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.500
What are the difficulties in business relations?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.500
How to solve them?

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.500
You probably found some of your vulnerabilities.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.000
Determine the ways of development.

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:13.000
How to get away from these vulnerabilities, how to close them.

02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.000
The most important thing in business relations is not to work with theory.

02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.000
The most important thing in business relations is practice.

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.000
Practice and repeat the same tools.

02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.000
See what works and what doesn't.

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:30.000
See what is your inner resistance to one or the other.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.500
Help yourself.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.500
At first in simple situations.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.500
Reinforce yourself, praise yourself.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.500
Go to difficult situations.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.500
Practice is the key to your success in effective business relations.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.500
Remember that now in the most successful psychological schools

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.500
the word leader is replaced by the word communicator.
