00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
The Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
The Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
The Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
The Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Let me introduce myself.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
I am Sergey Akov.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I am a professor at the Russian Academy of Foreign Affairs,

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
I teach MBA courses at our Academy,

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
as well as at the Russian Academy of People's Economy.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
We will be talking about the problems of micro- and macroeconomics.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Perhaps many of you have already encountered this science,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
which can be called in different ways.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
It is often referred to as economic theory.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Sometimes the word economy is referred to as economics in English.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
So, micro- and macroeconomics are two components of this science.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
If you have studied this field before,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
you should know that the economic theory

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
is made up of thick textbooks,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
whole volumes.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
It is impossible to tell you all their contents.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
You probably won't need them.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
That is why I decided to focus on the issues

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
that may be interesting and useful to you,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
as well as to practical people.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
That is why my course is best referred to as

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
economics for practical people.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
In the West, it is called managerial economics.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Or, to put it simply, management economics.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Please look at the topics we will be covering in this course.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
in addition to the lecture course,

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
you are also offered a fully printed lecture course.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
It would be good to read this course.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
At the end of each topic, you will find a control task.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
It would be good to solve them.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I recommend you pay special attention to the case studies,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
that is, to the analysis of practical situations.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And to complete the study of this course,

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
probably best of all, with the control test.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, I wish you success. Let's get started.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So, once again, look.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Our first topic is introduction to economics.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Two questions on this topic.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
The first question is economics as a science.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Well, the topic is introductory, I will dwell on it very briefly.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
And first of all, I would like to tell you

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
what kind of science is economics.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Where did it come from? How did it arise?

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
It arose from a very simple contradiction.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
People's needs are limitless,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
and the resources they have to meet these needs,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
unfortunately, are limited.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
And if soon it is so, then there is a problem of choice.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, a couple of elementary examples.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Let's say you come to a store.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
No matter how rich you are,

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
the amount of money you have is limited.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
But you will not buy only bread or only milk.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
What is your task?

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
You need to buy an optimal set of goods

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
for the limited amount of money you have.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
That is, the set that best satisfies your needs.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
That is, you solve a typical economic problem

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
related to the problem of choice.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Or a company.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
The company cannot produce everything.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
It also has limited resources.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
What is its task?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
The best way to use the limited resources

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
to get the maximum profit.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Local authorities would like to build a school,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
a road and a hospital.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
But again, there is not enough resources for everything.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Again, you have to choose.

04:48.000 --> 05:04.000
So, this is what economic theory does.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And now, please look at the next slide.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
The subject of economics.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
That is, what does economics study?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Here we look.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
The subject of economics is the decisions made in society

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
when distributing limited resources

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
between different options of their use

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
in order to maximize the well-being of people.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
But this is what I have already told you about.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Economic theory is about how people, companies, society as a whole

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
make their choice in conditions of limited resources.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Let's look further.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The next slide.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
If you have to make a choice soon,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
you should answer three basic questions.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
The first question is what and how much to produce.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The second question is how to produce.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
The third question is for whom to produce.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Again, the simplest example.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Local authorities would like to build a school, a road and a hospital.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But again, there is not enough resources for everything.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
The first question they have to answer is what to produce.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Okay.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Let's say they chose the road.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
But another question comes up.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
In fact, the road can be built in different ways.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
You can hire a regiment of soldiers with shovels,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
or you can use less manual labor and more machines.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
What is the point?

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
The choice of the best production technology.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
That is, you have to answer the question how to produce.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Okay.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Let's say we built a road.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
The pie is baked.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
What should we do next?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
We have to divide the pie.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
So the question is for whom to produce.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
In the application of the road, you can do this.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You can make the road paid or free.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
If we make the road free,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
we answered the question for whom to produce, for whom the road.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
If the road is free, then the road is for everyone.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
If it is paid, then it is already a road for those who can pay the required amount.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
A compromise option is possible.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
The road can be free for the residents of our region and paid for the residents of other regions.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
So, these are the three main questions of the economic choice.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
And then, look.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
I have already said that the economic theory consists of two parts.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Microeconomics and macroeconomics.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
What do they study?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Look at the slide.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
Microeconomics studies the behavior of individual economic agents

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
and their interaction in individual markets.

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
Individual economic agents can be, for example, a separate company or a separate household.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
And in the center of microeconomics attention are the prices and volumes of production of individual goods,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
the choice of an individual consumer, the release of resources of an individual company, and so on.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
Macroeconomics, in turn, studies the people's economy as a whole, as a single system.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
And in the center of its attention are the general indicators of public production,

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
such as GDP, economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and so on.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Let's look at a few simple examples.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Let's say that the company X fired 100 people.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
What sphere does this relate to?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Obviously, to the microeconomics. Why?

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
Because it is about the behavior of a separate enterprise.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
In Russia, the level of unemployment has decreased.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
In this case, it is about the economy as a whole.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
And this issue is related to the macroeconomics.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.000
But if the world oil prices have sharply increased due to the war in the Middle East?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Think about it.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Micro or macro?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
In fact, micro.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
In fact, microeconomics.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Why?

10:30.000 --> 10:39.000
Because in this case, we are talking about the market of a separate commodity, even a very large market.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
The microeconomics studies the markets of separate commodities.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
But a separate market is not necessarily a market in our village.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
A separate market can be the world market.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
For example, the world oil market.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
This is a subject of microeconomics.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
And a couple of comments on the same subject.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
It should not be thought that the microeconomics is engaged in some less important, less significant things.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
In fact, everything big is made up of small.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
It is impossible to understand how the forest develops if we do not know the laws by which individual trees grow.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
And in general, look, the prefix micro literally means small.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But the matter is not in size at all.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
The object of microeconomics may be larger than the object of macroeconomics.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
The simplest example.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
For example, Microsoft.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
A separate company.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Its activity is related to the course of microeconomics.

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
But at the same time, in terms of the volume of the annual release, Microsoft exceeds the head of the internal product, for example, of Luxembourg.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
But the economy of Luxembourg is macroeconomics.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
The object of macroeconomics.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What happens?

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
The object of microeconomics, I repeat, may be larger than the object of macroeconomics.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Another comment.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
It is not necessary to divide micro and macroeconomics with a single wall.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
In fact, they smoothly flow from one to another.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
And then look at the next slide.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
We will talk about very important things.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
About economic costs.

12:57.000 --> 13:05.000
I have already said that the main problem of economic theory is the problem of rational choice.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
And if we make a choice soon, the concept of economic costs arises.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
This is probably the most important concept in the course of economics.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Therefore, I will dwell on it in more detail.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
First, the definition.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
At first glance, it may seem difficult to you.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
In fact, there is nothing difficult.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I will explain.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Look at the definition.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
We read.

13:38.000 --> 13:55.000
Economic costs of obtaining a certain benefit are other benefits that could be obtained with the same resources,

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
but from which you will have to refuse if the choice is made in favor of this benefit.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
I strongly suspect that, firstly, nothing is clear, some three-stage definition.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
In fact, let's figure it out.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Let's use your example.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
You came to study some science.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Let's say, the same economy.

14:30.000 --> 14:39.000
Tell me, please, answer yourself the question, what are your costs of studying this course?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
In fact, we are talking about costs.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Let me explain.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
What are your costs of studying economics?

14:49.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, it is quite likely that many of you, first of all, remembered the tuition fee.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
In fact, it does not matter how much you pay, but how much you pay.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Of course, the tuition fee is your expenses.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
But economists make a certain adjustment.

15:16.000 --> 15:31.000
Look, now the annual course of study at the Moscow University of Economics costs about 7,000 units.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
But at the end of the 19th century, the same annual course cost about 30 rubles.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
Does it mean that the tuition fee was cheap at that time, and now it has become expensive?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I hope you understand that it is not the case.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So, what do economists say?

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
Economists say that when you pay money for some benefit, for example, education,

16:03.000 --> 16:17.000
you spend, you lose not the money itself, but some other benefits that you could have acquired for this money.

16:18.000 --> 16:30.000
These unobtained benefits and your losses or your expenses associated with the obtained, considered benefit.

16:31.000 --> 16:44.000
For example, you could study economics, and you could spend this money on vacation.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
So, what happens?

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
If you study economics, you will not be able to relax normally.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
These are your losses associated with studying economics.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Someone, instead of studying economics, could buy a new fur coat.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
So, the expenses associated with studying this course, the absence of a fur coat, are losses or expenses.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, okay.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
What else do you lose by studying economics?

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
In addition to paying for your studies, you also lose time.

17:26.000 --> 17:38.000
But again, not the time itself, but some benefits that you could have acquired, received during this time.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What benefits do you lose?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Each in a different way.

17:44.000 --> 17:52.000
Someone, instead of studying, could work more, earn more money.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
So, what goes into the economic costs of education?

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
The lost salary, or rather the benefits that could have been acquired for this salary.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Someone, instead of studying, could repair an apartment.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
According to the alternative costs, what goes into it?

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
The dissatisfaction of living in an unrepaired, dirty apartment.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
Someone, instead of studying, could raise a child.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
So, what goes into the alternative costs of education?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
An uneducated child.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Someone could just relax.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
So, what goes into the alternative costs of education?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
The lost pleasure of watching your favorite TV series.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
So, what happens?

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
In order to assess the alternative costs of obtaining this benefit...

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I forgot to say, alternative costs and economic costs are synonyms.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
In order to assess the alternative costs of obtaining this benefit,

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
you need to assess all the losses that you incur in this regard.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
And then, in order to bring these losses to a common denominator,

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
the value of these losses, of course, would be desirable to be expressed in monetary units.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, I would like to make a couple of comments on alternative costs.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Very important, which must be taken into account.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
The first comment.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
Alternative costs arise only where there is an alternative.

19:46.000 --> 19:53.000
There is no alternative, there are no alternative or economic costs.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Let's take an example.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
I have already said that we are considering a situation when you decide to study some new course.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
During the course, you have to spend money on food.

20:12.000 --> 20:22.000
Will the food expenses go into the alternative costs of obtaining education?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
No, they will not.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
And here is why.

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
Because you have to eat in any case, regardless of whether you are studying or not.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I repeat again.

20:38.000 --> 20:47.000
Alternative costs arise only where there is an alternative.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
If you have to bear expenses, regardless of whether you are studying or not,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
then economists do not include these expenses in alternative costs.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Let's take an example.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Here is a road.

21:10.000 --> 21:21.000
It leads from point A to point B.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
As it turns out, there are two lanes.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
On this side, cars go from A to B.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
On this side, cars obviously go from B to A.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
You have to get to the car from A to B.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Where will you catch the car?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Which side will you stand on?

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
Obviously, elementary experience tells you that you will stand somewhere here.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
Explain your behavior from the point of view of the theory of alternative costs.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I will say right away that the time to turn from A to B,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
if the car goes like this, and you decided to stand here,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
we will consider the time to turn to be equal to zero.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Why are you standing here?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Let's discuss.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
What do you want?

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
Obviously, you want to get from A to B as cheaply as possible.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
And obviously, you think that the driver will take with you the smaller the amount,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
the less his expenses.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
So, there is a question.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
What are the alternative costs of a driver for transportation?

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
For transportation, you, from A to B, if he still goes there,

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
they are equal to zero or close to zero.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Why?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Because if he still goes in this direction,

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
then neither his time, nor the fuel consumption will be included in the alternative costs for transportation.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
He still goes in this direction.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Of course, he will have alternative costs.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But what are they related to?

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
To the reluctance to have a stranger in the cabin.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Who knows what you will throw there.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
But if you are a pretty lady,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I dare to assure you that there are no costs here,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
only benefits.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
Therefore, a lady's car will probably cost faster than a man's.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
And look, what would happen if you caught a car standing here?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Cars go from B to A.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And you need from A to B.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You will turn the car around.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
But then the alternative costs of the driver will be much higher.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
Then, in the alternative costs of the driver for transportation from A to B,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
if he goes from B to A,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
all these expenses will be included,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and the lost time,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
and the lost time,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
and the costs of fuel and everything else.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Imagine that here in point A is an international airport,

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
and the driver is going to fly away to rest abroad.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You will turn him around.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
He will not go to the airport, but he will take you to B.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But you will have to pay him a lot.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
Because his alternative costs in this case will be very high.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
We live in an alternative world.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
There are a lot of alternatives.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
So, all alternatives at the same time are impossible to implement.

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
Therefore, when you evaluate alternative costs of getting some benefit,

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
you need to choose the best alternative.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
For example,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
let's say,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
a certain lady has a choice today.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
She has several alternatives for tonight.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
Well, what alternatives can there be for tonight?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
To rest.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
To rest.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
To rest, just stay at home and watch TV.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
To meet, for example, with FOMO.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
To meet with FOMO.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
To meet with EREMA.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
To study the economy.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
You see, there are four alternatives.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
The question is,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
what will be included in the alternative costs of rest?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It is impossible to implement everything at the same time.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You can't study both FOMO and EREMA at the same time.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
You can't study the economy at the same time.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
To evaluate alternative costs of rest,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
you need to consider

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
the value of the best of the other alternatives.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
What is obvious?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Of course, it is studying the economy.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
So, in this case, alternative costs of rest

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
will include the lost pleasure of studying the economy.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
Well, I hope we have discussed

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
economic or alternative costs.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
But there is another very important concept.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It is important for practice.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Irreversible costs.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Look at the slide, please.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
After determining the economic costs,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
it is possible to determine irreversible costs.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
What is written there?

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Irreversible costs are the costs

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
that were incurred earlier

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
and that cannot be returned.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Economists do not take such costs into account.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Let's look at an example.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
You are on the road.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Here is the starting point.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
You have a choice.

28:31.000 --> 28:41.000
To study or not to study.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
To make the right choice,

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
you need to evaluate the benefits and losses,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
that is, the costs that you incur in connection with studying.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
What benefits do you get from studying?

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
You probably expect to finish your studies

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
with a higher salary

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
or a more successful career.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Someone may simply like to study.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I have met such people.

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
Let's assume that the benefits of studying

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
can be estimated in rubles.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
Let's assume that if you go to study,

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
you will get different benefits for 120 rubles.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Good.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
But on the other hand,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
if you go to study,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
you will incur some losses.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
What losses?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
We have already talked about them.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
What will you lose?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
A salary.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Maybe.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You will have to pay for your studies.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
You will be able to rest less.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
All these are your losses,

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
all these are your costs in connection with studying.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
If you did not study,

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
what would you get?

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
You would save money for your studies.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
You would rest more.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And so on and so forth.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Let's assume that you estimate all this in 100 rubles.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
So, if you go to study,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
you will get what?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
A benefit for 120 rubles.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
But you will incur a loss for 100 rubles.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But it is obvious that

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
the benefits are greater than the costs.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
So, you should start studying.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
If you think rationally, of course.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
If you think rationally, of course.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Okay.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
You started studying,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
you paid money,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
you just started studying,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
and you faced a very unpleasant surprise.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
They teach worse than you expected.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
What two numbers would you say this is?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Bad studies.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
But obviously, the benefits.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
If you are taught badly,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
what would you get?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
You would get a benefit from education

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
for a smaller amount.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Let's assume that it turned out

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
that with such quality of education

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
you would get a benefit only for 80 rubles.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Knowing this in advance,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
if you think rationally,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
you would not go to study.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But in fact, what is the point?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
You get a benefit for how much?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
For 80 rubles.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And you incur a loss for 100 rubles.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It is obvious that you should not study.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
But there is a nuance.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Let's assume

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
that out of these 100 rubles of costs,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
50 rubles, let's say,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
is the fee for education.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And 50 rubles, out of 50 rubles,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
you estimate all the other losses.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And let's assume, again,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
that according to the terms of the contract,

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
you pay money at the time of the start of study.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
What does this mean?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
It means that

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
when you get to this point,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
these 50 rubles that you have already paid

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
have become irrevocable costs for you.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
They will not be compensated for you

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
under any circumstances.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Even if you continue to study,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
even if you quit studying.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
What is your alternative now?

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
When you have already started studying at this point.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Either to continue studying,

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
or what?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Or to quit studying.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
To continue or to quit.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
What do you think when you are already at this point?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Yes, I was deceived,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
promising better knowledge.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
But now,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
if I continue studying,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
how much will I benefit?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
80 rubles.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And what are my costs

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
in connection with the continuation of my studies?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Alternative costs.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Only 50 rubles.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
These 50 rubles

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
will not be returned to you in any case.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Even if you continue studying,

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
even if you quit it.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Accordingly, these 50 rubles will go into what?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Into irrevocable costs.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
These are no longer alternative costs.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
And at this stage,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
you should not take them into account.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Economists do not take irrevocable costs into account.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
They look ahead.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And here is another example

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
to make it easier for Louis to understand all this.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
You are abroad.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
You

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
bought a yacht tour ticket.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
During the tour, you are being photographed.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
And the tour has not yet finished,

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
as the photos are already shown, printed and hanging on the rope.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
You were not asked to take a picture.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
You are not forced to take a picture and buy it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You can decide whether to buy it or not.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Photos are expensive.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
3 dollars per one.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
But ask yourself.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
What are the alternative costs of a photographer

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
at the moment

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
when all the photos are already shown, I repeat,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
printed and hanging on the rope?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
What are they equal to?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
If you think that they include

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
the cost of the film,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
the cost of the photographer's work,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
then you are wrong.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Pay attention.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
At the moment when the photos are already made,

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
the alternative costs of the photographer are zero.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Why?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Because at this moment

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
he has already incurred all his costs.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
And his costs have become irrevocable costs.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
His alternative costs, I repeat,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
are zero.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
And if this is so,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
then what line of behavior

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
would you choose the best?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Of course, to bargain.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
But how to do it best?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
You need to approach the photographer,

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
just take a look at him

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
and say,

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
dear,

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
here is a great work,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
great photos.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I like these three very much.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
What to do?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
During this tour

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I spent all my money.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I have one dollar left.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
You can even open a wallet and show him this dollar.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I understand that this is not good.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
But I did not know, dear, what I can do.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I did not know that there would be such magnificent photos.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
I spent all my money.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I have only one dollar left.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I like these three photos.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
You can put this dollar in front of him,

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
take the photos.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
He will not be satisfied with something,

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
but he will not chase you.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Why? I repeat again.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
What is his alternative at this moment?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
What can he do with your photo?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
You can be a highly respected member of society,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
but still not Julia Roberts and not Michael Jackson.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
So what is his alternative?

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Either sell you this photo

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
or just tear it off and throw it away.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
So his alternative expenses for using the photo,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
in addition to selling it to you,

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
are equal to zero.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Zero.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
He will, of course, scold himself in Turkish.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
He will say something like,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
you are a bad sheep, at least you have wool and furs.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Knowing in advance that you are such a fruit,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
that you will behave like this,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
he would not have taken a photo of you at all.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
But when the photos are already taken,

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
his alternative expenses are equal to zero.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
All his expenses have become irrevocable costs.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You see, people in business

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
very often catch each other

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
on irrevocable costs.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Most often this is not ethical.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
But in this case,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
my conscience is absolutely clear.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I did not ask him to take a photo of me.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
If I had a contract with him,

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
promised to pay him three dollars for a photo,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
and then, when he had already paid all the expenses,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
he would say that I have no money.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Here it would be perhaps unethical.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
But in this case, I did not ask him

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
and I do not think that I did something bad.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Well, we have looked at,

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
disassembled economic costs

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
and irrevocable costs.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Well, let's summarize this first question.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
What, in my opinion, would be very good

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
to have you in the dry residue?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Once again.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
What does economics study?

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Decisions that are made in society

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
about the use of limited resources

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
to meet unlimited needs.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
The main problem of economics

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
is the problem of choosing

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
in conditions of limited resources.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
If you have to choose soon,

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
the concept of alternative or economic costs arises.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Economic costs of obtaining this benefit

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
are those benefits that you had to refuse,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
or rather the value of those benefits

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
that you had to refuse

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
if you make a choice in favor of this benefit.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
And if all the costs are already incurred,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
they have become irrevocable costs.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
And do not forget, of course,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
that economic theory consists of two disciplines,

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
microeconomics and macroeconomics.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
Well, let's go back to the slide of the topic.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
You see, there are two questions.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
The first one is economics as a science.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The second question is economic circulation.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
Well, the first one, I think, is poor and poor.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
We have already looked at it.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
The second question is very interesting,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
but I will leave it to you to study on your own.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
You have it in the text of the lecture

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
with Russian examples.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
We just have a little limited time.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
We still have a lot to do.

42:14.000 --> 42:27.000
And let's move on to the second topic.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
The second topic, please look at the slide,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
is called the supply-demand model

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
and its use in economic analysis.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
This topic is very important,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
because the supply-demand model

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
is perhaps the most important,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
the most widely used model

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
in the course of microeconomics.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
It explains how prices are formed,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
how the proceeds of the sold and purchased goods

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
are formed in the separately taken markets.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I repeat once again,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
it can be both the local market,

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
the national market,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
and even the global market,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
but the goods are taken separately.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
How is the price formed?

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
The price is obviously formed depending on what?

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
On demand and supply.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Therefore, the first question is the demand and its factors.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
In the second question, we will focus on supply.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
The third question is the market balance.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
We will combine demand and supply together

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
and see how the market price is formed.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
And then we can talk a little

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
about practical applications of theory.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So, look, we start with the first question.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Demand and its factors.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
The definition is very simple.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Please look at the slide.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
It is quite consistent with the usual

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
life logic.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
We read that demand is called

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
the quantity of goods that all buyers

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
can and want to purchase

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
during this time

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and under certain conditions.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
It seems to me that there is nothing complicated here.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
Well, demand is how many goods we want to purchase.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
The moment during which we need to set the time,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and we need to take into account certain conditions.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
These conditions are called demand factors.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
What are the main factors of demand?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Please look at the slide.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
The first factor is the price of a given product.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Well, what is obvious?

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
It is obvious that the demand for a product depends on its price.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Undoubtedly, I think everyone agrees.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
The second factor is the price and quantity of substitutes.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
How to understand?

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Well, let's consider the demand for a Zhiguli.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
What does it depend on?

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
It is clear that it depends on the price of Zhiguli.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
But it also depends on the price and the brands of the similar class,

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
which are substitutes for Zhiguli.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
I hope it is clear.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
If foreign brands are cheaper,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
we will most likely make a choice in favor of foreign brands,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
while reducing the demand for Zhiguli.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.000
The third factor is the price and quantity of additional goods.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
What are the additional goods in relation to Zhiguli?

45:56.000 --> 46:06.000
Well, gasoline, maintenance, garages, spare parts, and many other things.

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
And when I decide whether to buy Zhiguli or not,

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
I will think about the price of Zhiguli,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
but also about the maintenance of Zhiguli,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
that is, the price of additional goods.

46:23.000 --> 46:30.000
The demand for Zhiguli depends on the price and quantity of additional goods.

46:31.000 --> 46:39.000
The third factor is the income and distribution of income between different groups of consumers.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Well, what is obvious?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
If our income is growing,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
then we will most likely increase the demand for Zhiguli,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
although not necessarily in other equal conditions.

46:50.000 --> 46:58.000
The third factor is the habits and tastes of consumers.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
It is also obvious that they affect the demand.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
The number of consumers obviously affects the demand.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
The more consumers live in our city,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
the more demand for one or another good in this city.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
In terms of climate conditions,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
it is clear to everyone that in Africa the demand for fur will be small,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
and in the North it will be a little more.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
The expectations of consumers.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I will talk about expectations separately.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
So, let's talk about demand factors in a little more detail.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
But wait, I forgot one point.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Look again at all the demand factors.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
How many are there?

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Eight demand factors.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And what do you think, what do you think?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
What is the important factor,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
very important, obviously, in terms of life,

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
which affects the demand?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
I did not mention.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
What factor is not mentioned?

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Obviously, I did not say anything about the quality of the product.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
But do not hurry.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
Do not include quality in the number of demand factors.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
That's why economists do not do this.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
Because we are talking about the demand for a given product.

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
And the demand for a given product implies the demand for a product of a given quality.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
That is, we initially consider the quality of the product to be set.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
If the quality changes,

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
then we consider it as another product,

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
although a very close substitute.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
In other words, the Zhiguli 10 and 12 models

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
are considered as different benefits in the microeconomy.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Moreover, even Zhiguli of different colors

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
are also considered as different benefits in the microeconomy.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Is it clear?

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
We consider the quality of the product to be initially set.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
Therefore, it is not mentioned in the number of demand factors.

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
Now let's talk more specifically about the demand factors.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
The first factor, I repeat, is the price of a given product.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
Let's see how the price of a given product affects the demand for it.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
It's very easy.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
There is a so-called law of demand in the microeconomy.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Let's look at the next slide.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Here is its formulation.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The law of demand.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
The lower the price of a given product,

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
the more customers want to purchase it

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
during a given period of time

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
and under other unchanged conditions.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
The law of demand is reflected graphically.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Look at the graph.

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
Look, we put the quantity of the product along the x-axis.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I use the internationally accepted designation

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
of quantity.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
It means Q.

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
And along the y-axis we put the price of a given product.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
And what do we see?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Look carefully at the graph.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
I think it's not difficult.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
The lower the price of a product,

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
the more demand for it

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
under other unchanged conditions.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Just a small caveat.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
You see, I drew the function of demand as a linear one.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
In fact, it doesn't have to be linear.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
It can be non-linear,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
it can be like this, curved.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
But it doesn't cancel the law of demand.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
The linear function of demand is most often used for simplification.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
We have seen how the price of a given product

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is the first factor.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
But there are seven other factors besides the price.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Let's talk about them.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Look at the next slide.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
It says that the effect of all other factors on demand

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
is manifested in the shift of the demand curve

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
from right to left

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
when the demand increases

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
and from left to right when it decreases.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Look at the graph.

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
Let's assume that the demand function is initially set to D0.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
Imagine that the income of consumers has increased.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Nothing else has changed.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
What does this mean?

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
It means that at any possible price

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
people will want to buy this product more than before.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And the demand curve goes where?

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
To the right.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
The opposite situation.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Let's assume that the income of consumers has decreased.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
What will we encounter here?

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
The most important thing is that at any possible price

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
people will want to buy this product less than before.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
And the demand curve shifts to the left and down.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
What was the fourth factor?

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
The fourth factor is the income of consumers.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
What is the fifth factor?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
The fifth factor is the habits and tastes of consumers.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
I think it's obvious.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Imagine this situation.

53:18.000 --> 53:26.000
Russian consumers suddenly fell in love with Estonian products.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
For example, sour cream.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
What will this lead to?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
That the demand for sour cream, for Estonian sour cream,

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
will decrease and the demand curve will shift to the left.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Look, this is what is important to keep in mind.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
What I'm telling you now seems very simple conceptually.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.000
But it's very important to learn how to translate words into the language of graphics.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
I said that if Russians suddenly discovered

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
harmful properties of Estonian sour cream,

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
the demand for sour cream will decrease and the curve will shift to the left.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
I really hope that over time Russians will figure it out

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
and will understand that Estonian sour cream is not so bad.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Moreover, it's very edible.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
What will this lead to?

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
That the demand for sour cream will increase again at the same price.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
And the demand curve will shift to the right.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
So, we haven't talked about expectations yet.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
What expectations are we talking about in the microeconomics?

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
First of all, expectations of the price of a product.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Imagine that consumers are waiting

54:52.000 --> 54:58.000
for a sought-after product to become more expensive.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
What will they do today?

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Most likely, they will buy more products today.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
There may be a sharp demand for products.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
And the demand will increase, and the demand curve will shift to the right.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
There are other expectations.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
They are waiting for this product to become cheaper.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Why would they buy it today?

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Today, the demand for it will decrease under other equal conditions,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
and the demand curve will shift to the left.

55:33.000 --> 55:41.000
By the way, some companies often use this in their advertising strategies.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
As usual, Don Stroy is trying to lure customers.

55:49.000 --> 55:56.000
They usually say that today the prices are so-so,

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
but from the first day of the next month, apartments will become more expensive.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
What are the company managers trying to do?

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
They are trying to increase the demand for apartments today.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That is, to shift the demand curve to the right.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Okay.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Let's look at the second factor.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
We haven't talked about it yet.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
What was the second factor?

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
If you remember, the second factor was the price and the number of substitutes.

56:31.000 --> 56:44.000
Let's see how the demand for imported cars changes the price of a Zhiguli.

56:45.000 --> 56:52.000
Let's suppose that for one reason or another, imported cars became more expensive.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Look at the slide, please.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
The left graph shows the demand for imported cars.

57:01.000 --> 57:11.000
The initial price of cars was P1, and they wanted to buy Q1 imported cars.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Cars became more expensive, and the price became P2.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
Accordingly, they want to buy less imported cars.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
The demand fell to Q2.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
But since imported cars are more expensive,

57:30.000 --> 57:40.000
this means that consumers at any price of Zhiguli want to buy them more than before.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
And the demand curve for Zhiguli shifted to the right.

57:48.000 --> 57:56.000
We observed something similar right after the financial crisis of 1998.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Remember what happened there.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
The ruble fell sharply.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
As a result, the ruble prices for foreign cars increased.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
For many consumers, foreign cars became inaccessible.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
So they switched to Zhiguli.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
And the autobus temporarily solved its problems with the ruble.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
The demand for Zhiguli increased, and the demand curve shifted to the right.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
Now let's talk about how the markets of additional goods interact with each other.

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
In relation to cars, additional goods are gasoline.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
Let's assume that cars became more expensive.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
What would this lead to?

58:49.000 --> 58:57.000
Previously, the price of a car was P1, and they bought Q1 cars.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
Now cars cost P2, and they buy Q2 cars.

59:03.000 --> 59:13.000
But by buying fewer cars, we begin to spend less on gasoline,

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
and the demand curve for gasoline shifts to the left.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
The demand for gasoline decreases.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
Well, I think I have covered all the factors.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
I have looked at them.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
And to finish this question, I would like to make a very important remark.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Look at the next slide.

59:37.000 --> 59:43.000
Economists distinguish between the concept of demand and the quantity of demand.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
These concepts sound very similar, but they are different concepts.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Let's read.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
If the change in the purchase of a particular product is influenced by the change in its price,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
its own price, then the change in the quantity of demand is mentioned.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000
In this case, the demand curve does not shift, but we follow the demand curve.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Let's go back to the previous slide.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Cars, gasoline.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
What happened to cars?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Cars became more expensive.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Now they are bought less.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Previously, at the price of P1, they bought Q1 cars.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Now, at the price of P2, they buy Q2 cars.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Why do they buy fewer cars?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Because they became more expensive.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000
In this case, we say that the quantity of demand on cars has changed.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And we follow the demand curve from bottom to top.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000
If the change in the purchase of a particular product is influenced by all other factors,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
then the change in the demand itself is mentioned.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And here, the demand curve shifts.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Let's go back to the previous slide.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Why do they buy less gasoline?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Because cars became more expensive.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
At the same price of gasoline, they start buying less.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Here, the demand curve shifts to the left, and we say that the demand on gasoline has decreased.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Not the quantity of demand, but the demand.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
That's it. We have finished the first question.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Now let's talk about the second question.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The offer and its factors.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The definition of an offer is as simple as the definition of a demand.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Let's read.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000
An offer is the quantity of goods that all manufacturers can and want to produce and sell

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
during a given time and under certain conditions.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The same thing.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
The demand is how much they want to buy, and the offer is how much they want to produce and sell.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Now let's look at the factors of the offer.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
There are a lot of them here too.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
The first factor is the price of the product.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The second factor is the profitability of the goods that are competitive to the goods in production.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I'm afraid it's not very clear, but we'll look at it in a specific example.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The third factor is not better, but the profitability of the goods that complement the goods in production.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We'll also look at it in an example.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
The fourth factor is the costs of the manufacturers.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
The fifth factor is the state taxes and subsidies.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The sixth factor is the number of manufacturers.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The seventh factor is the goal.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
The eighth factor is the natural conditions.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The ninth factor is the expectations of the manufacturers.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Let's go on.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
We've discussed the factors of demand before.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Now let's talk about the factors of the offer.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
The first factor of the offer is the price of the product.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Here we have what economists call the law of the offer.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Here it is on the next slide.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
The law of the offer.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
The higher the price of a given product,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
the more manufacturers want to sell it

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
during this time and under other unchangeable conditions.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
You see, this law is opposed to the law of demand.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
What did the law of demand sound like?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The lower the price, the more they want to buy.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
What does the law of the offer sound like?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The higher the price, the more they want to sell.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
What does the law of demand sound like?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The higher the price, the more they want to sell.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Graphically, we have this law.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Again, on the x-axis, we put the quantity of the product.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But now it is not the quantity of demand, but the quantity of the offer.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And on the y-axis, again, the price of the product.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And what do we see?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The ascending function.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
The higher the price of the product,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
the more manufacturers want to produce and sell it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Why is that?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Let's look at it with a simple conditional example.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Let's look at a completely conditional example.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Let's assume that there are only three oil fields in the world.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
On each field, according to the natural conditions,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
you can extract only one conditional barrel of oil.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
No more.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
We introduce it for the sake of simplicity.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Such a simplification.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But what is obvious?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Every manufacturer would like to sell their oil as expensive as possible.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Even for a million dollars.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But every manufacturer has some price that suits it minimally.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
If the oil is cheaper,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
it simply will not be engaged in this price.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And the difference in these minimum prices

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
is due to the differences in oil production costs at different oil fields.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So, we have three oil fields.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
The first field is in the Middle East.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Let's assume that the minimum price that suits the Arabs

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
is, let's say, 5 dollars per barrel.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
This is the minimum price that suits the Arabs.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The second oil field is located in Siberia.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
There, the cost of production is higher.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And let's assume that the minimum price that suits the Russian firm

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
is 10 dollars per barrel.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I repeat, if the price is lower than 10 dollars per barrel,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I believe that the oil production becomes unprofitable

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and the Russians stop producing oil.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And finally, the third oil field is located in Norway,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
on the shelf of the North Sea.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The minimum price that suits the Norwegians is, let's say, 15 dollars per barrel.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I want to emphasize once again that at every oil field

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
you can only extract one barley per field.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Now let's reason.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Let's assume that the market price of oil

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
has fallen by less than 5 dollars per barrel.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
How much oil will be extracted?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It is obvious that under such conditions, no one will extract oil.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And the supply of oil to the market will be zero.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And if the price reaches 5 dollars per barrel?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I repeat, 5 dollars per barrel is the minimum price that suits the Arabs.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It suits no one else, only them.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So, at the price of 5 dollars, how much oil will be supplied to the world market?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Only one barrel.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Good. And if the oil prices rise and the price will be 10 dollars per barrel?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
We assume that the Arabs simply cannot extract more than one barrel.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But who will be involved?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The Siberians.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
The Russian oil company will start extracting oil.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
10 dollars per barrel is the minimum price that suits it.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So, how much oil will be supplied to the world market?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Already 2 barrels. The Arabs and the Russians.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And how much oil will be supplied to the world market?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
2 barrels.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Good. And if the price reaches 15 dollars per barrel?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Who will be involved? The Norwegians.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And they are already extracting oil.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They extract their own barrel.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And the supply of oil to the world market reaches 3 barrels.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
What have we got?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
We can transfer this table to the graph.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Look.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The x-axis shows the quantity of oil.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
The y-axis shows the price of the product.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, at the price of 5 dollars per barrel, how much oil is extracted?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
They offer 1 barrel to the world market.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000
At the price of 10 dollars per barrel, how much oil is extracted and offered?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
2 barrels.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
At the price of 15 dollars per barrel, how much oil is offered?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
3 barrels.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Combining all these points, what have we got?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Dependency.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
The quantity of oil offered to the world market.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
The quantity of oil offered to the world market.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
At the price of oil.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
So, what have we got?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
The function of the supply of oil.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And we denote the supply with the letter S.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Why?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Supply.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:10.000
There is a case when you ask a bad student for an exam.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
You draw a function for him.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You write the letter S and ask him.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Is it a demand or a supply?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
He thinks that the letter S means demand and says that it is a function of demand.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And he gets 2.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Not because of ignorance of English.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Because in English S is a supply.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And because of ignorance that the function of demand simply cannot behave like this.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
The ascending function is a function of supply.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
It corresponds to the law of supply.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The higher the price, the greater the quantity of supply.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Why is this function ascending?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Because with the price rising, the production of goods becomes profitable.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Where the costs for goods are higher.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
In addition to the price, we have many other factors.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Let's talk about them.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Let's look at the next slide.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
We read.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:34.000
The influence of all other factors on the supply is manifested in the movement of the supply curve.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Right-down when the supply increases and left-up when it decreases.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Let's try to figure it out.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
What does it mean that the supply has increased?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It means that at the same price, they want to offer more goods than before.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Let's say, before, at the price of $10 per barrel, how much was offered for sale?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
2 barrels of oil.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And now, for some reason, they offer to sell at the same price.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
How much?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Not 2, but 3.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And what happens?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000
The supply curve shifts to the right.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:44.000
That is, when the supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right-down.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And when the supply decreases, what does it mean?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It means that at the same price, they offer less goods than before.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Let's say, before, at the price of $10 per barrel, they offered to sell 2 barrels of oil.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And now, for some reason, they offer only 1 barrel.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And what happens?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The supply curve shifts to the left-up.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Once again.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:34.000
When the supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right-down.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
When the supply decreases, the supply curve shifts to the left-up.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Let's see now why this can happen.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:58.000
The fourth factor is the cost of the producers.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Let's discuss.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Let's suppose, for some reason, I don't know why,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
the costs of all three fields increased by $5 per barrel.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
In our example, by $5.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
The next factor, the fifth one, the fifth factor is the state tax and subsidies.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
How does it affect the offer?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Well, taxes are actually different.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Let's take those taxes that increase the costs of the producers.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So, the taxes are the same costs.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
When we introduce a tax, the costs of the producers increase by a large amount.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
The tax and the supply curve go up.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
The supply curve decreases.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
What is a subsidy?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
A subsidy is a tax, on the contrary.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
When the state doesn't take money, it gives it to the producers.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Taking into account the subsidies, the costs decrease.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And the supply curve goes down to the amount of subsidies.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
The purpose and the natural conditions are not complicated.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Let's talk about the expectations of the producers.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
About the expectations of the producers.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Remember, when we talked about demand, we also discussed expectations.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
What were the expectations?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
The expectations of the changes in the price of the goods.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Okay.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Let's say that the producers are all waiting for their goods to become more expensive.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
How will they act today?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Most likely, they will hold on to the goods.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
They won't rush to sell it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And what will happen?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
The supply will decrease and the curve will go up.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
The simplest example.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You are going to sell your apartment.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You are waiting for the apartments to become more expensive.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Most likely, you won't rush to sell the apartment.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
If everyone does this, the supply of apartments will decrease.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
On the contrary, if everyone is waiting for the apartments to become cheaper,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
what will the producers try to do?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
They will try to sell their apartments as soon as possible.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And the supply of apartments will increase.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Here is an example.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Near the house where I live, a garage city has appeared since the beginning of time.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
There is a rumor that a new elite house will be built in this place.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And what do we see?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
There is an ad on every pillar that says, I will sell the garage.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
People are waiting for the garages to be demolished, so they will become cheaper.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And they are trying to sell their garage.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The supply of garages is increasing.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Now let's look at the second and third factors.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
You see the profitability of goods that are competitive to the production of these goods.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Let's talk about this factor.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Imagine two goods on the market, on the food market.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
A carrot and, for example, a potato.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Suppose the carrot is more expensive.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000
How do you think this will affect the offer of a potato?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Just look.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Just look.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
To give the right answer, you need to stand on the position of the farmer-producer.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
In no case on the position of the consumer.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
We won't understand anything like that.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It is the position of the farmer.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
What do farmers focus on?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
On the profitability of one or another product.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
The carrot is more expensive.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So the profitability of the carrot for the farmers has increased under other equal conditions.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
What do the farmers answer?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
They increase the offer of the carrot.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And in fact, look at the slide.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Previously, the carrot cost P1.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
The market offered Q1 carrots.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Now the carrot costs P2.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And the market offers Q2 carrots.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So with the price increase, the farmers increase the offer of the carrot.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
But the land is limited.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Remember, I started this lecture.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
The needs are limitless, and the resources, including the land, are limited.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But the land is limited. What does this mean?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That if the farmers offer more carrots to the market,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000
they take the land from under the potatoes and take this land for the carrots.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
What do we observe?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We observe that on the potato market, the offer of potatoes becomes less.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I repeat, the carrots produce more,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
the land is taken from under the potatoes and given to the carrots.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So the land under the potatoes is less.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And at the same price, the offer of potatoes decreases.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Look at the graph on the right.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:11.000
There, the curve of the potato offer shifts from position S0 to position S1.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
This is a problem.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
To better understand this, let's look at another example.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Think for yourself.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Think for yourself.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Let's model this situation.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Economists have become more expensive.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.000
What will happen to the offer of tankers?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Economists are the same product as carrots, potatoes, or Zhiguli.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
So if we draw the curve of the offer of economists,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
what do we put on the x-axis?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Their quantity.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And on the y-axis, the price of the economist, his salary.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And we observe the rising curve.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
How much did economists cost before?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
P0?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
How many people in such a situation chose the profession of an economist?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Q0?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And the labor market offered Q0 of economists at their price, i.e. at their salary.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Economists became more expensive.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Now, the price of an economist P1.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
What do young people answer?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
The majority of young people, under other equal conditions,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
start choosing the profession of an economist.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And after some time, the number of offers of economists on the market increases

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
from Q0 to Q1.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
This is the curve of the offer of economists.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
These are economists.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And now let's look at the market of tankers.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
My logic is very simple.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I will start with the following.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I will say that if a young person chose the profession of an economist,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
he will not go to tankers.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And what do we observe?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
At the same price of the labor of an economist, P0,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
the number of offers of economists on the market will be less than before.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Before, the curve of the offer will go to the left.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And now let's think about what I suggest you think about.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Oil has become more expensive.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
What will happen to the offer of natural gas?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Think about it.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Oil has become more expensive.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
This will lead to the fact that at a higher price of oil,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
it will be produced at the same oil fields that were previously unprofitable.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And the offer of oil will increase.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
This is no longer an economist, this is oil.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
The price of oil was P0,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
so it was $10 per barrel.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
They were mining oil for $2.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And at the price of P1, $15 per barrel, they began to mine for $3.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But very often, when oil is mined, natural gas is also mined.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So what will this lead to?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:24.000
The offer of gas on the market will increase.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Look, gas is a good that complements oil production.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And here we see that the curve of the offer of gas will shift to the right.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000
At the same price, gas will be mined more simply because more oil is mined.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And to finish this question,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
let's focus on a very important point.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Remember I told you that the concept of demand and the value of demand should be distinguished?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
The concept of the offer and the value of the offer should also be distinguished.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Let's read.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
If you look at the slide,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:38.000
if the sale of a given product is influenced by the change in its price,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
then the changes in the value of the offer are mentioned.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
At the same time, there is a movement along the curve of the offer.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Look, please.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Why is oil mined more?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Because oil has become more expensive.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Therefore, we move along the curve of the offer from this point to this one.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
The curve of the offer does not shift here.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Oil has become more expensive, the value of the offer has increased.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Let's read further.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
If the change in the sale of a given product is influenced by all other factors,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
then the changes in the value of the offer are mentioned.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
At the same time, there is a shift along the curve of the offer.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Look at the right graph.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Oil has become more expensive, the value of the offer has increased.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Here we move along the curve.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
But at the same time, at the same price of gas,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
it is offered more to the market.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And we observe a shift along the curve of the offer.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
In our example, it is moving up and down.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
We have considered the second question.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Let's move on to the third question.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The third question is market balance.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
What is required here?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So far, we have considered the demand and supply isolated from each other.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And now we have to connect the functions of demand and supply in one picture.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
This is how it is done on the slide.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Two curves of demand and supply.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Let's discuss.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Let's assume that at the beginning the price was at the level of P1.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
P1.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Look, what are we going to observe?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You see, the price is high.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000
At this price, the demand will be small.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
What is it equal to on the graph?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Q1d.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You see?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
At the price of P1, the demand is Q1d.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
At such a high price, few people would want to buy this product.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And what do you say about the offer?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
The price is high.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
At such a price, many would be happy to produce and sell this product.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:44.000
That is, the offer value at the price of P1 is Q1s.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So what do we observe?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:56.000
At the price of P1, the offer value exceeds the demand value.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And on the market, we observe the commodity.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Manufacturers want to sell more goods than the consumers agree to buy at such a price.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I must say that in this model we are looking at the so-called completely competitive market.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
What is a completely competitive market?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
It is a market in which there are a lot of independent sellers and buyers.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
No one separately controls the price.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:44.000
The price on the market is set spontaneously, under the influence of the demand of thousands of buyers and the offer of hundreds of sellers.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:55.000
But still, at the price of P1, when sellers cannot sell their goods, the price spontaneously begins to decrease.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Let's see now what happens if the price on the market is accidentally set to the level of P2.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
What do we observe at the price of P2?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
The price is low.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
At such a price, many would be happy to buy this product.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000
And the demand value for the product is, look at the slide, Q2d.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But the price is low for manufacturers.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:41.000
At such a price, very few manufacturers would like to produce and sell this product.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That is, at the price of P2, the product will be offered to the market.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Q2s.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
What do we observe now?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
They want to sell, they want to buy more goods than they want to sell.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
What is the difference called?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Do you know this word?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Of course, it is a deficit.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
A deficit arises on the market.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And the price of the product starts to rise.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And the next step, what do we observe?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Look carefully at the slide.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:32.000
There is some price, P with an asterisk, at which the quantities of demand and supply coincide with each other.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:40.000
This price is called an equivalent price on the market.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
P with an asterisk is an equivalent price.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And the number of goods purchased and sold at this price is called an equivalent number.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Now let's see how the balance can change.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
The next slide is called the shift of the balance.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Let's think.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Let's suppose, for some reason, maybe people's incomes have increased,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
demand for goods has increased.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
What do we observe as a result?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000
The demand curve shifts from D0 to D1.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
But let's suppose, at the same time, the costs of the manufacturer increase.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
What does this lead to?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
That the supply of goods decreases, and the demand curve shifts to where?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
To the left and to the right.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And what do we observe?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That the demand curve shifted to the right, and the supply curve shifted to the left.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And now these curves intersect at a different point.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
What, of course, happens in this case?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The price of the goods necessarily increases.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Both factors, in this case, and the increase in demand and the decrease in supply,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
pull the price towards the increase.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
There was a price of P0, now there is a price of P1.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And what happens to the equal amount?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
In my graph, Q0 is equal to Q1.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That is, the equal amount remains the same.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
But this is not necessary.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Just imagine that the demand curve, the demand function,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
shifted more to the right than the supply function to the left.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Can you see what happens?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
In this case, the price will be even higher.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And the equal amount will increase.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Imagine the opposite situation.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
When the supply curve shifted to the left more than the demand curve to the right.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
What will we observe?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
The price will increase even more.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But the equal amount will decrease.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Yes, we have looked at the third question.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
The fourth question is quite a big one.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
There are many practical applications of this theory.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Let's discuss at least a few of the simplest applications.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000
For example, in Russia, due to favorable weather conditions,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
a record crop of grain was harvested this year.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Please, illustrate this situation graphically.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Look, I assume that the grain market in our country is completely competitive.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
So, what will we have?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
The amount of grain along the x-axis,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
the price along the y-axis.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
There are some basic initial functions of demand and supply,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I mark them as D0 and S0.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
There is a certain equivalent price P0

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and a certain equivalent amount Q0.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And now, the condition, I will repeat it again.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Due to favorable weather conditions,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
a record crop of grain was harvested in Russia this year.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
What will change in the graph? Think about it.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
In fact, if a record crop of grain was harvested,

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
it means that the grain market is full.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
The grain market?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
It means that the supply of grain is increasing.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
And when the supply of grain is increasing,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
where does the curve of supply go?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Down and right.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Down and right.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And what do we see?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000
The price of grain starts to fall.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And will it be sold in the market?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
More.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Please note that in this case,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
only the curve of supply is shifting,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
but not the curve of demand.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Because no factors affecting demand have changed here.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
The market is just full of grain.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
There is more grain.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
The price of grain is falling.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And people buy more grain.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
But we are moving here.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
The curve of supply is shifting.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The curve of demand is not shifting.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
We are moving along the curve of demand.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Due to the decrease in price,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
consumers start buying more grain.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Let's continue the analysis of the situation.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Let's assume that under such conditions,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
the Ministry of Agriculture

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
decides to buy additional grain

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
from the State Reserve.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
What will happen in the graph?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Think about it.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It's not difficult.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Additional grain purchases

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
from the State Reserve.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Additional grain purchases

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
from the State Reserve.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
But if this is done,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
who will come to the market?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
A new major buyer

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
in the face of the Ministry of Agriculture.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
So now what is increasing?

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Demand for grain.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And the curve of demand is shifting.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
To the right.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
To the D1 position.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
What are the producers of the Ministry of Agriculture

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
trying to achieve?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
They are trying to maintain the price.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
So that the price does not fall below P0.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
To support the farmers.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
The other thing is that when the Ministry of Agriculture

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
really implemented such a policy,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
the farmers had already sold their grain.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And the Ministry of Agriculture really supported the buyers

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
with its grain purchases.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Another example.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
The economies of India and China

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
show rapid growth.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
How will this affect

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
the situation in the world oil market?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Let's look at the world oil market.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
What do we have here?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The amount of price.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
There is a demand for oil in the world market.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
There is an initial supply of oil.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
There is a certain equilibrium price.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And there is an equilibrium amount.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
What happens next?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
The Indian and Chinese economies are growing rapidly.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
How will this affect the world oil market?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Obviously,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
the rapidly growing economies

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
need more oil.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
As the necessary raw material.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So what is happening in the world market?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:38.000
The curve of demand for oil is shifting to the right.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And we see that

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
oil prices are increasing.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But the equilibrium amount is also increasing.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
If the curve of supply of oil has such an upward slope.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Another example.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
The price of oil in the world market has increased.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
How will this affect the currency market in Russia?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Please note that

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
the change of the world oil price has an adverse effect.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
We are studying the change of the currency market in Russia.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
What is being sold and bought in the currency market?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Foreign currency.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
For example, American dollars.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
So we will put the number of dollars along the x-axis.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
The dollar is the same product as any other.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
There is a demand for the dollar, there is its supply.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So along the x-axis is the number of dollars.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And along the y-axis

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
is the price of the dollar in rubles.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
What is the price of the dollar?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
The dollar exchange rate.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So what do we have?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
The beginning of the exchange rate.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
The exchange rate is the price of the dollar.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
What do we have?

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The initial demand for the dollar and the initial supply of the dollar.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Let's think about it.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Oil has become more expensive.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Russia exports oil.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000
the inflow of foreign currency, American dollars, has increased in the Russian market.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
What will we give?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
The supply of dollars is increasing.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And the curve of the supply of dollars

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
shifts to the right.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
What happens to the exchange rate?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
The dollar starts to get cheaper.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
This is what is happening in Russia.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Because of the large inflow of dollars in the Russian market,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
the dollar is getting cheaper.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Now let's assume that the Central Bank of Russia

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
does not want the dollar to get cheaper.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
What should it do?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It wants the exchange rate to remain the same, P0.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
What should the Central Bank do?

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It should increase the demand for the dollar.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It starts to buy dollars.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
What do we see?

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
On one hand, the supply of dollars is increasing.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
On the other hand, the demand for dollars is increasing.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
This demand for dollars can lead to the dollar price,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
the dollar exchange rate, remaining the same.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Or maybe it will fall a little

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
if the demand for the Central Bank increases by a smaller amount.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Let's say it will be like this.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
This is what we are seeing now.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
To finish this question and this topic,

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000
we need to understand that this model

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
describes various market situations well.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
But this is actually no more than a tool, like a hammer.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And this tool should be able to be used.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And to correctly predict the consequences of the demand and supply changes

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
in the real market,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
we need to understand that the functions of demand and supply

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
are not always so standard, so classical.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Look at this.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
What a realistic view of the function of supply.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Demand and supply.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Sooner or later, the function of supply

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
will change vertically.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Look.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Remember, I assumed that we have only three oil fields

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
in the world market.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And let's assume that the price is set at $15 per barrel.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Remember our example?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And three barrels of oil are mined, sold and bought.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
But the fourth oil field simply does not exist.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It does not exist.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So, the fourth barrel of oil will have nowhere to go

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
until new oil fields are opened.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.000
And it turns out that the curve of supply becomes like this.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It changes vertically.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And if it is so,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
then the growth of demand for oil will lead to

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
the curve of demand shifting to the right.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But in this situation,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
what will grow?

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Only the price of oil.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And the equal amount of oil in the world market will remain the same.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
The same is true for the demand curve.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
It may not be quite standard.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
But here is the standard type of demand curve.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And if it is, God forbid, insulin,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
what is the demand for insulin dependent on?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
On the number of patients, right?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
But the price is dependent on the weak.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
And the price is dependent on the weak.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And if it is,

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
then the curve of demand for insulin

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000
in a certain price range is close to the vertical one.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
This is how it will be.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
That is,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
with the price increase,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
insulin will be bought less.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
It should be taken into account.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
This is insulin,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
a product that is not easy to replace.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And there is some product that is easy to replace,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
that is easy to refuse.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
For example,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
beer of this brand.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Beer of this brand.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
What will be the demand function for beer?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
It is for this brand,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
not for beer in general,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
but for beer of this brand.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
The product is very easy to replace.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
That is, with a slight increase in the price for beer,

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
for this kind of beer,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
consumers can easily switch

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
to another kind of beer

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:05.000
and the demand function will be very similar.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I am saying this

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
to repeat once again.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
To better predict

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
the consequences of the change in demand and supply

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
in a particular market,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
we need to look

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
at how real the results will be,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000
how the demand function and supply function will look like.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
They are not always standard.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
They can be close to vertical and close to horizontal.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I repeat once again.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
The more detailed theory proposals

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
are presented in the text of the lecture.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
You can read them.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Well,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
we have finished the second topic.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Let's start with the new topic.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Production and costs.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Please look at the slide.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
The questions of the topic.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Our first question is

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
the production function.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
What is it?

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
What is it?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
First of all, the definition of production is very simple.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Production is any human activity

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
to convert limited resources,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
all kinds of material, labor, natural, ready-made products.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
So, what is the idea?

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
To produce something,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
resources are needed.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And the production function

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
shows the connection

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
between what?

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Between the number of resources used

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
and the maximum production volume

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
that can be achieved

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
if all available resources

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
are used in the most efficient way.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
The simplest production function

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
for example.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
A housewife is baking pies.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
For an hour,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
let's say,

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
she can bake

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
if she works normally,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
does not idle,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
but she has organized her work in the best way,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
she can bake

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
10 pies.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
So, if we

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
denote the number of housewife's work

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
by L, labor,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
and the output by Q, quantity,

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
then the simple production function looks like this.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Q equals

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
10 times L.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I hope you can see

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
that this function shows

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000
how the output changes

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
depending on the amount of labor

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
that the housewife uses.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
On condition, I repeat,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
that she has organized her work in the best way

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
and works with normal intensity.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
This is the simplest production function.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Of course, more complex functions are used in economics.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Look, please.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
The most common economic theory

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
uses a two-factor production function

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
that reflects the dependence of the output

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
on the number of labor and capital used.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Labor is denoted by L,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
capital is denoted by Q.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Q equals

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
A multiplied by K in the degree of α,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
multiplied by L in the degree of β.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000
So, K and L are the number of labor and capital used.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I would like to clarify

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
that we measure labor in hours.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And under capital,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
we do not understand the amount of money

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
invested in business,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.000
but what is called in economic theory

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
physical capital,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
that is, the means of production,

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
machines, equipment.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Thus, the amount of capital

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
we usually measure in machine hours.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And I repeat again,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
A, α and β are already known parameters.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And if we know them,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
then we just need to substitute

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
the number of labor and capital

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
that can be changed,

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
and we can get the corresponding volume of output.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I repeat again,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
it is possible to achieve

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
that labor and capital are used

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
in the most rational way.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
What do these parameters mean?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Let's start with parameter A.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Look, please.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Imagine that the quantities of capital and labor are given,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
and parameter A changes.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
What does this mean?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000
That with the same quantities of capital and labor,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
we can get a larger volume of output.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
So parameter A reflects the influence

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
of technical progress on production function.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
What do the parameters α and β mean?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
α and β are the so-called

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
elasticity coefficients

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
of output of labor and capital.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
What does this mean?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
The α coefficient shows

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000
how many percent the output changes

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
when the capital is changed by 1%.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
The β coefficient shows

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
how many percent the output can be changed

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
when the labor is changed by 1%.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Knowing the production function,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
we can measure the scale of the output.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Read the definition on the next slide.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
The scale of the output shows

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
how many times the output increases

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
when all factors of production,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
that is, all resources, are increased at the same time.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
To produce something,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
we need resources.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Let's say we use two factors,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
labor and capital.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Let's assume that we increased

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
the amount of labor and capital by 2 times,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
that is, we built a factory twice as large.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
This means that we use twice as much capital,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
we build twice as many machines,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
and we use twice as much labor.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
What will happen to production?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Production will increase, of course,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
but not by 2 times.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
There are three possible cases.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
In the first case,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
we increase the number of factors by 2 times,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and the output increases by 3 times.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
In this case, we say

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000
that there is an increasing scale of output.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
In the second case,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
we increase the output,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
we increase all factors, excuse me,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
by 1 time,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
that is, labor and capital increased by 1 time,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
by 2 times, in my example,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
and the output increases by less than 1 time,

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
for example, by 1.5 times.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Then we say that there is a decreasing scale of output.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
In the third case,

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
we increased both factors,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
all factors increased by 1 time,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
in my example, by 2 times,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
and the output increased by 1 time,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
by 2 times, too.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Then we say that there is a constant scale of output.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
It plays a very important role

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
in determining the optimal size of the enterprise.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Let's say, Zhiguli.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
They can be assembled in a small workshop.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Of course, they can.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
AvtoVAZ, as a production complex,

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
in terms of labor and capital,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
is supposed to be 100 times larger

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
than such a small workshop.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
That is, it uses the production factors 100 times more.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
And the output of AvtoVAZ,

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
at the same time, increases by 200 or 300 times.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
What does this mean?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
That it is more effective for AvtoVAZ

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
to assemble machines at a large factory

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
than in a small workshop.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So, if the return on scale increases,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
we should increase the size of the enterprise.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Another example.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
In Soviet times,

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
people were very fond of building giant enterprises,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
including agriculture.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
For example, they built giant pig farms

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
for thousands or even tens of thousands of cattle.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Not only did the entire ecology fly within a radius of 100 kilometers,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
but what else was there?

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Let's say, a giant pig farm

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
uses production factors

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
100 times more than a small farm.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And the production of meat

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
is, let's say, 10 times more.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
What does this mean?

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
That a large enterprise in agriculture

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
is economically inefficient.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
That is why small farms are quite effective in agriculture.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And when we increase the size of the enterprise,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
we sooner or later come to a situation

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
where the increasing return on scale

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
is constantly changing, and then decreasing.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.000
This means that we should not increase the size of the enterprise any further.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It is better to enjoy a larger number of enterprises, but smaller in size.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Knowing the production function,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
we can always calculate the costs of the enterprise.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Here we come to the second question.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Economists divide costs into accounting and economic.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000
The definition of accounting costs, please look at the slide.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
The accounting costs of a company

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
are the sum of its actual payments for the purchased resources.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
The sum of the actual payments for the purchased resources.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
This is very easy.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
In order to produce something,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
the company needs a wide variety of resources.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
The company buys these resources.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
And then the accountant

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
sums up all these payments for the purchased resources

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
and puts them into the account.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And then the accountant

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
sums up all these payments for the purchased resources

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
and puts them into the account.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Let's look at the simplest example.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Let's look at the simplest example of accounting costs.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Suppose the company uses equipment

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:43.000
worth 200 rubles and service life, let's say, 5 years.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Obviously, the whole cost of equipment

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
cannot be attributed to the expense of one year.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Amortization must be used.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
When using the simplest linear amortization,

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
the expenses of one year will be attributed, respectively,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
200 divided by 5, 40 rubles.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
That is, the accountant makes his report.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Amortization is 40 rubles.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Next.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Suppose the company uses raw materials and materials

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
worth 80 rubles annually.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
The accountant writes, raw materials 80.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:37.000
And the company pays, let's assume, 60 rubles per year in salary.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000
The accountant writes, salary 60.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Now let's assume that the equipment was bought on credit

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
at 10% annual.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
10% of 200 equipment costs are 20 rubles.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So, the percentage on credit annually will be 20 rubles.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
The percentage on credit is another 20 rubles.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Let's assume that the company does not make any more payments.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
But it does not make any administrative, transport expenses,

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000
advertising, research, does not pay taxes related to cost.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
None of this.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
The accountant sums up all these payments and writes,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.000
the sum of accounting expenses is 200 rubles.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000
The economist has a slightly different view.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Economic expenses are alternative expenses.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
They represent the value of those benefits

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:10.000
that could be obtained with the most profitable

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:16.000
of all alternative ways of using limited resources.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I'm afraid it's not very clear, but it can be simpler.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:29.000
In practical calculations, economic expenses include,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
in addition to the obvious or accounting expenses,

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
also the unclear expenses.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
We can write that economic expenses are equal to

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:51.000
accounting expenses plus some other unclear expenses.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
What are accounting expenses?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I've already said.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
It is not clear what are the unclear expenses.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Let's read.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:13.000
The unclear expenses are the amount of unpaid income

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
of the company on its own resources.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.000
We are talking about the income that the company management

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.000
could get using its resources,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.000
not in this business, but in some other way.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Let's analyze this.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Imagine that you founded your own business.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Obviously, you came to this business with a lot of money.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
What did you bring with you?

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Perhaps, some amount of money capital.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Let's say, 100 rubles.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Could you use this capital alternatively?

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Of course, you could.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000
What is the simplest alternative to use this money?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.000
You could put it in the bank.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Then you would get a percentage.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
If you invested this money in your own company,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
you would lose this percentage.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000
And this unpaid percentage

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
would be included in the unclear expenses of the company.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Let's say, you invested 100 rubles in your business.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
You had to close your bank account.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Therefore, you lost 10% of the invested money.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I suppose that the bank pays 10% of the investment.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
So, what is included in the unclear expenses?

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.000
The unpaid percentage

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
of the investment in your own business.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000
You got this money for free.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't use it.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000
You invested 100 rubles,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
lost 10% of the money

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
that you could have got if you kept this money in the bank.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And, accordingly, this unpaid percentage

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
of 10 rubles would be included in the unclear expenses.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Then, in order to start your own business,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
you had to quit your job.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
And you probably worked for a hire.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So, what did you lose?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
The salary.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
The unpaid salary

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
would also be included in the unclear expenses of the company.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Let's say, you earned 200 rubles by working for a hire.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
You founded your own business,

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
and you lost this 200 rubles.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000
The economists include this 200 rubles of unpaid salary

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
in the unclear expenses of your company.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I write down

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
the unpaid salary.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Let's say, how much was there? 20 rubles.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
The unpaid salary.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Another assumption.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Let's suppose that for the sake of your business

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
you turned your apartment into an office or a warehouse.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
What did you lose in this case?

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
How to estimate your losses?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
You could have rented this apartment.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
By renting it, you could have received,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
let's say,

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
another 20 rubles per year.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
By giving this apartment to your business,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
you lost this 20 rubles.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
So, the unpaid salary

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
would also be included in the unclear expenses.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000
The unpaid salary is 20 rubles.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Well, that's good.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Summing up all these lost income,

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
we get

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.000
the unpaid expenses of the company.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
They are

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
50 rubles.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
It turns out

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
that the total economic expenses of the company

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
are 200 rubles of accounting expenses,

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
50 rubles of unpaid expenses,

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
and 250 rubles in total.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
But now we need to answer the most important question.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Why do economists make up the original?

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
What did they come up with

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
in addition to the obvious or accounting expenses,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
which are obvious to everyone,

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
some other unclear expenses,

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
which, I repeat,

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
the company does not even pay to anyone?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000
The unclear expenses are the income

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
that entrepreneurs lost

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
by investing their resources in the company,

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
which they provided to the company,

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
supposedly for free.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
But why?

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Without knowing the unclear expenses,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
we cannot assess

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000
how profitable this business is to entrepreneurs.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
So, I have already said about the expenses.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Total economic expenses

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
amounted to 250 rubles.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
But the company produces something.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
And let's assume

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
that it produces, sells products,

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
and let's assume

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
that the annual revenue of the company

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
amounts to,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
let's assume,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
let's assume,

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
240 rubles.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
The annual revenue is 240 rubles.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
How will an accountant assess the situation?

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
An accountant only takes into account

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
the accounting expenses.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Not because he is so stupid,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
but because an accountant

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
is guided by certain rules

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
of accounting.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
So, an accountant will most likely

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
congratulate with a profit.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
The annual revenue is 240 rubles.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
The total accounting expenses are 200 rubles.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000
The profit is 40 rubles.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
40 rubles.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
And how will an economist assess the situation?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
An economist will take into account the loss.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
The loss of revenue

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
minus the economic expenses

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
amounts to minus 10.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
The loss is 10 rubles.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
What does it mean in the economist's mouth?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
It's very simple.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Nobody will take you into this business.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
If you didn't go into it,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000
how much money would you have in your wallet

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
at the end of the year?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
You would keep your money in a bank,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
you would have an annual interest of 10 rubles,

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
you would work for a hire,

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
you would have an annual salary of 20 rubles,

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
you would be able to rent an apartment,

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
you would receive an annual rent payment of 20 rubles,

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
you would have 50 rubles in your pocket

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
at the end of the year.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
And how much would you have in your pocket at the end of the year?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Only 40 rubles of accounting revenue.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
The revenue is 240,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
accounting expenses are 200.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
So, you have only 40 rubles in your pocket.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I don't take taxes, of course.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.000
So, this business is simply not profitable for you

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
under such conditions.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And now let's summarize.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Let's look at the slide.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000
The difference between the revenue and accounting expenses

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
is the accounting profit of the company.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So, we calculated the revenue minus accounting expenses

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
is the accounting profit.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
The difference between the revenue and economic expenses

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
is the economic profit

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
or the over-profit of the company.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
So, it turned out that the economic profit

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
is the revenue minus the economic expenses.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
And the third conclusion that we can make.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
If the economic profit is negative,

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
the company is losing money,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
the business is not profitable for the entrepreneurs,

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
no matter how big the accounting profit is.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
And to finish this question,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I'll give you a few examples.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I'll give you the first example.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I came up with it.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Don't think that in our department

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
things really work this way.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Look.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I was offered to go on a business trip

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
to another city, let's say, for a week.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I know that during the week I will earn

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
100 rubles.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
What is this 100 rubles

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
in my example?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
100 rubles is my revenue.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
This is what I get on a business trip.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
But, as I have already reported,

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I work in the Academy of Foreign Trade.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
I have to conduct some classes for you every week.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I can't just leave like that.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
If the classes are interrupted,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
there will be a scandal.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
What should I do?

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I'll go to my colleague and say,

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
listen, I really need to leave.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Conduct classes for me.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But it's not convenient for me to ask him just like that.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
So I'll tell him this.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Conduct classes instead of me,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I'll pay you 50 rubles.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
In this case, there will be no scandal.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I'll pay you to conduct the classes.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
And who will conduct it, that's the second question.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
So I pay my colleagues

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
to go on a business trip without any problems

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
50 rubles.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000
What are these 50 rubles in our terms?

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
This is what I take out of my pocket

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
and pay my colleagues.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
These are my accounting expenses.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Well, it would seem that everything is fine.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
It is clearly necessary to go on a business trip.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
After all, I will earn 100 rubles on a business trip,

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
and I will pay, I will bear the expense

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000
to go on a business trip.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.000
50 rubles.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000
So my accounting profit will be 50 rubles.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I don't take any other accounting expenses from a business trip.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But there is one nuance.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Because I'm going on a business trip,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I won't be able to read a lecture

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
on the MBA program.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
No one will make me a profit here.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
But I won't get a salary.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Let's assume that I get 60 rubles on the MBA program.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
If I go on a business trip,

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I won't get these 60 rubles.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Accordingly, 60 rubles

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:00.000
make up my unobvious travel expenses.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Thus, my total economic travel expenses

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:18.000
make up 110 rubles.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
50 plus 60.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
60.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000
And the revenue on a business trip is only 100.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
It turns out that the economic profit on a business trip

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000
is equal to minus 10.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
It is not profitable to go on a business trip.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Another example.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Let's say you have a small cafe.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:01.000
You decided to install a small arcade in the corner

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
to attract more visitors.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
What are your obvious or accounting expenses for this project?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Obviously, the annual amortization of the arcade

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000
and the cost of its annual maintenance.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000
And what are your unobvious expenses for the arcade?

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I assume that you don't have a free place in the cafe.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Therefore, if you install an arcade in this corner,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
you will have to remove the table.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Let's suppose.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Accordingly, the lost profit from the table

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
will be included in the unobvious expenses for the arcade.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
You can't ignore the unobvious expenses.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Otherwise, you can't understand

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
how profitable or unprofitable it is for you to install an arcade.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
One more example.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:10.000
My friend was engaged in this business.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.000
She is an intermediary between a mayonnaise factory and a retail store.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
She took mayonnaise at the factory for implementation,

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.000
and then she built it into a retail store.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000
One day she had problems.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:37.000
The container owner at the wholesale market refused to buy mayonnaise from her.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000
He explained that mayonnaise was sold slowly.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000
She came to me with a question,

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Sergey Georgievich, what does it have to do with fast or slow?

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
She said, I don't take money from him.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I give him the mayonnaise for implementation.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
If he sells it quickly, he will pay me quickly.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
If he sells it slowly, he will pay me slowly.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000
What does she not understand?

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
She does not understand that the container owner has unobvious expenses.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
What are they?

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
The container is not rubber.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
If mayonnaise is in this corner,

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
there will not be, for example,

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
the same Estonian sour cream,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
which is supposed to be sold faster.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
So what happens?

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:39.000
The lost profit from the implementation of sour cream

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
will be included in the unobvious expenses for mayonnaise.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
It turns out that an ordinary trader in the market,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
having no idea about these scientific terms,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
obvious and unobvious expenses,

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
cannot but take into account the unobvious expenses in his practical activity.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Let's start the third question of the topic.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
The types of expenses.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:11.000
All expenses, both accounting and economic,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.000
can be divided into constant and variable.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
What is the basis of such a division?

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Look, let's say the company increases the production.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
And it is clear that with the increase of production,

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
some expenses change,

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
and others remain unchanged.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Those expenses that do not change with the increase of production,

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
we call constant expenses.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And those expenses that change with the increase of production,

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000
we call variable expenses.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Why are expenses generally divided into constant and variable?

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Because we also divide the production factors into constant and variable.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
The fact is that some production factors

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
can be easily and quickly changed

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000
with the increase of production.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Let's say, it is easy enough for a company to hire new workers.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Workers are a variable factor of production.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
But a company needs a certain amount of time

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
to acquire new equipment,

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
that is, to use additional capital.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Therefore, we usually take equipment

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:53.000
in the short term to the constant factor of production.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Look at the definition again on the slide.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Constant expenses are the expenses,

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.000
the amount of which does not change with the change of production.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000
That is, these are the expenses of the constant factors of production.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Amortization, rental fee, interest on credit,

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
salary of management are usually related to constant expenses.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Unclear expenses are also usually related to constant.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Now variable expenses again.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Variable expenses are the expenses,

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
the amount of which changes with the change of production.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
That is, these are the expenses of the variable factors of production.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Usually, they include salary of production workers,

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
raw materials expenses,

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
electricity for technological purposes, and others.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000
So, constant expenses and variable expenses.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
If we sum them up,

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.000
we get the total expenses.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Look at the slide.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Fc is the fixed cost.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Vc is the variable cost.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.000
The total cost is TC.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
The total expenses of the company.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000
It is also very important to know the expenses per unit of production,

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
or the average expenses.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Average constant expenses.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
We denote them by the letter AFC.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Look at the slide.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000
These are the constant expenses per unit of production.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
So it turns out that AFC is equal to

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
FC is the constant expenses divided by the volume of production Q.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Average variable expenses AVC.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000
These are the variable expenses per unit of production.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
How to calculate them?

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
We divide the total amount of variable expenses by the volume of production.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Look at the formula.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.000
And finally, the average total expenses.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000
These are the total expenses per unit of production.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
How to calculate?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
We can divide the total expenses, the total cost, TC,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
by the volume of production Q.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Or we can calculate it in another way.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000
We can sum up the average constant and average variable expenses.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:01.000
The marginal cost is a very important role in economic analysis.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000
The marginal costs are the addition of the total costs

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
when the volume of production is one unit.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Look at the formula.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.000
MC is equal to delta TC divided by delta Q.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
How to understand it?

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Let's say you have already produced a certain number of units of production.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:37.000
You want to produce one more additional unit of production.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
To produce an additional unit of production,

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
you need to bear additional costs.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:59.000
These additional costs required by the production of an additional unit of production

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
are the marginal costs.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.000
But look, when do we increase the volume of production?

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
And when do we increase the total costs?

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:18.000
After all, the total costs are made up of constant and variable costs.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
But only variable costs are increased.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Constant costs do not change in a short period of time.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:39.000
So, the addition of the total costs is equal to the addition of the variable costs.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:46.000
So, the marginal costs can be calculated by dividing delta VC,

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.000
the increase of the variable costs, by the delta of the production.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:01.000
To better understand this, I will give an elementary example of calculation of costs.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Please look at the slide.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
We have two volumes of production here, 10 and 11.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
What are the constant costs?

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
All the time 50.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
They do not change with the change in production,

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
by determining the constant costs.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.000
And what are the changes?

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
The variables change.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Suppose at the time of production 10 they were equal to 100 rubles,

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
and at the time of production 11 they were 105 rubles.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
All other parameters are easy to calculate.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
What are the total costs equal to?

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
How much were they before, at the time of production 10?

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
50 plus 100, that is, 150.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Now they are at the time of production 11.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
50 plus 105, 155.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
How to calculate the average constant?

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000
It is very easy. We divide the constant costs by the volume of the production.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
50 divided by 10 is 5.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.000
5 rubles of constant costs per unit of production at the time of production 10.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
