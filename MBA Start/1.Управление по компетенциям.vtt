00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hello, colleagues! My name is Natalia Volodina. I am the Director of the Silvana Fashion Group's Holdings.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.080
Today we will talk about competences. We will define this concept.

00:12.080 --> 00:16.880
We will also talk about what a corporate model of competences is

00:16.880 --> 00:23.920
and when it is appropriate to develop individual competences profiles for the positions that exist in our organizations.

00:24.880 --> 00:30.560
We will talk about the stages of developing a competences model in the company,

00:30.560 --> 00:34.720
how to plan this project and form a project team,

00:34.720 --> 00:41.200
how to design a competences model and develop the development levels of each of the competences,

00:41.200 --> 00:46.640
how to form an individual competences profile for the positions.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.120
After that, we will talk a little about how to implement a competences model

00:51.120 --> 00:57.520
so that the model we develop does not become a ballast that is owned only by the staff.

00:57.520 --> 01:05.200
It does not work, is not used by the line managers and employees of our companies.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.840
Therefore, we talk about how to best use the competences model

01:09.840 --> 01:13.200
when evaluating, when holding evaluation events,

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
when forming development plans, personnel reserves, and so on.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.320
At the end, we will say a few words about why competences models do not always work

01:22.320 --> 01:28.080
and what needs to be done to make our model viable.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.400
If you ask a question about what competences is,

01:36.400 --> 01:41.520
I suggest that each of you answer this question for yourself, what exactly do you understand.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.120
Most often, they answer that it is some kind of knowledge or skills,

01:45.120 --> 01:48.560
that it is skills, and so on.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.960
In fact, there are a lot of definitions,

01:52.960 --> 01:59.520
and each consultant and staff management specialist strives to give their own definition.

01:59.520 --> 02:05.200
But if we look at the slides you see,

02:05.200 --> 02:11.280
where a number of definitions of this term, given by various authors, are given,

02:11.760 --> 02:15.360
in each of them we will see the word behavior,

02:15.360 --> 02:19.840
behavioral indicators, or behavior model, and so on.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.240
Behavior is a key word in this definition.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.240
I will give the following example.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.040
Our employee knows, can, and drives a car well, but he does not.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.640
Can we talk about the presence of competences?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.680
Of course we can.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.080
There is competence, but it is not demonstrated.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.760
There is no work behavior that can be interesting to the company.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.160
If this employee, for example, is an accountant,

02:58.160 --> 03:00.720
it is not his main duty to drive a car.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.520
So we close our eyes to this,

03:03.520 --> 03:08.880
and by and large we do not require him to demonstrate such behavior in a working situation.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.800
But if this is a driver, then the question arises whether we need him.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.360
The fact is that we, as employers, acquire employees,

03:21.360 --> 03:23.360
let's say, we acquire their competences.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.960
We are interested in the behavior that they demonstrate in work,

03:26.960 --> 03:30.960
the business behavior that leads to the achievement of those results,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.360
those goals that lie ahead.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.000
Another example.

03:36.080 --> 03:42.400
For example, we have a chief engineer who is a very strict leader.

03:42.400 --> 03:50.080
For example, employees from his department may even be a little bit tired of his style of leadership.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.720
If we talk about whether he knows, can he manage people,

03:54.720 --> 03:59.040
he can tell us, I have been doing this for 30 years, what else can I teach?

03:59.040 --> 04:03.600
And maybe he really knows the principles of modern management, but he does not.

04:03.760 --> 04:09.360
Therefore, once again, competence is, first of all, knowledge, skills, skills,

04:09.360 --> 04:14.960
some personal qualities, perhaps, motivational statements that are expressed through behavior.

04:14.960 --> 04:20.000
Personal qualities, again, do not sound easy to determine,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.240
because there are such competences that we will call as undeveloped,

04:24.240 --> 04:26.240
that it is very difficult to develop them,

04:26.240 --> 04:32.480
and that, let's say, they depend mostly on what kind of person you really are.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.920
But we will talk about all this in more detail a little further.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.920
What is a competence model?

04:37.920 --> 04:42.240
A competence model is a complete set of competence behavior indicators

04:42.240 --> 04:46.080
that allow the employee to successfully perform his or her work functions.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.840
The model, first of all, should be clear and easy to understand.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.720
What is the understanding?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.680
Employees.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.440
Because it is the employees and the top managers

04:55.440 --> 04:58.640
who have to work with the competence model.

04:58.640 --> 05:06.160
This is their tool, and we, as a staff, create this tool together with them and for them as well.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.160
The model should be described in simple language and have a simple structure.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.720
If the model is complex, it is difficult to perceive, difficult to use.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.040
Let's pay attention to the next slide.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.720
Competence map, organization or corporate competence model.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.080
What do we see?

05:22.160 --> 05:28.160
Individual competence or individual profile of the position that we form

05:28.160 --> 05:32.160
and which we will evaluate our employees.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.600
What does it consist of?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
How does it work?

05:35.600 --> 05:40.640
First of all, there is a part of competence that we call corporate competence.

05:40.640 --> 05:46.160
Corporate competence is a competence that can be applied to any position in the organization,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.920
regardless of the hierarchy.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.520
Whether it is the first person in the organization or a private employee.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.520
Corporate competence is based on the company's values.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.520
What is the company's answer to this question?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.960
Are we like this?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
Are we a team?

06:02.960 --> 06:06.240
Or are we always focused on the result?

06:06.240 --> 06:11.920
Or are we always client-oriented because we work in a service business?

06:11.920 --> 06:16.960
The company's values can be either recorded in some corporate documents,

06:16.960 --> 06:21.600
such as the strategy or the corporate ethics code.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.600
Maybe not.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.960
The company may be small in size and such documents do not exist.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.760
Nevertheless, it is what is in the air.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.720
Let's recall the situation when we were conducting an interview

06:34.720 --> 06:36.720
and taking candidates for a certain position.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.960
We noted that this is a professional person.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.920
He knows and has the professional competences that we need.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
But something is wrong with him.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
He is not ours.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.920
He will not survive in the department where we want to invite him.

06:53.920 --> 06:59.920
Maybe he is very ambitious, he is focused on the result,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
he is very active in achieving his goals.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.920
At the same time, in this department, in our entire company,

07:05.920 --> 07:11.920
corporate culture is characterized by such concepts as team spirit,

07:11.920 --> 07:13.920
as cooperation.

07:13.920 --> 07:19.920
It may turn out that this person will not be comfortable working with us.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
Or vice versa.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.920
We are active, ambitious, we always run forward, forward, forward.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.920
And the candidate who comes demonstrates a different behavior.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.920
He is a team player.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.920
He may not survive with us.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.920
We say that this is our intuition.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
It seems to us so.

07:39.920 --> 07:45.920
Now we can say that his behavior, his values do not correspond

07:45.920 --> 07:49.920
to the corporate competences that exist in our company.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.920
The number of such competences may be different,

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
but most often from 3, 4 to 6, 7.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.920
No more.

07:57.920 --> 08:03.920
Because the total number of competences in our model

08:03.920 --> 08:05.920
can also be different.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
But most often in the company practice,

08:07.920 --> 08:13.920
it is somewhere from 8 to 12 competences that are really working.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.920
It is important to remember the following.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.920
The development of corporate competences is part of working with corporate culture.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.920
When we understand and we want to materialize and explain in words,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.920
formalize those values that exist,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.920
in order to select employees based on these competences,

08:32.920 --> 08:36.920
to stimulate these competences, to develop, to encourage this behavior.

08:36.920 --> 08:40.920
So, let's go back to our slide,

08:40.920 --> 08:42.920
the organization competences map.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.920
We talked with you about corporate competences.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.920
But the next type of competences is management competences.

08:50.920 --> 08:55.920
Management competences are competences that are necessary for the leaders

08:55.920 --> 08:58.920
to successfully achieve business goals.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.920
Competences are developed for employees engaged in management activities.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.920
And, what is important, for employees who have subordinates.

09:07.920 --> 09:12.920
But the subordination can be both linear or direct, and also project.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
What does it mean?

09:14.920 --> 09:19.920
It means that if we have a task to select the project manager,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.920
we will analyze not only his professional competences,

09:22.920 --> 09:26.920
as a co-foundation in the area in which the project will take place,

09:26.920 --> 09:29.920
but we will also evaluate his management competences,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.920
how much he can manage the project and the project team.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.920
Most often, according to the experience of colleagues,

09:36.920 --> 09:42.920
management competences are standard in various areas.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.920
And such components are included as vision or business management,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.920
working with people and organization of activities.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.920
In our practices, in our companies,

09:56.920 --> 09:59.920
these competences can be called in different ways.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.920
And we will talk about how to call a competency.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.920
And the fact that I can call a company work with people,

10:05.920 --> 10:08.920
you will call a work in a team.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.920
Can it be the same?

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
Of course it can.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
And we will talk about it further.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
It is important to understand that, most often,

10:15.920 --> 10:20.920
management competences are laid out in these three areas.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.920
The next is professional competences.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.920
Professional competences are competences that are applicable

10:27.920 --> 10:30.920
to a certain group of positions.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
Groups of positions.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
It can be financial specialists,

10:34.920 --> 10:37.920
it can be sales department specialists,

10:37.920 --> 10:40.920
it can be personnel specialists.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.920
Yes, again, we are talking about a group of positions.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.920
Composition of professional competences is a very laborious

10:48.920 --> 10:51.920
and long process that can take years.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.920
I do not want to scare you, but there are not so many companies

10:55.920 --> 11:00.920
in which professional competences are developed for all groups of positions.

11:00.920 --> 11:07.920
Which group of positions do professional competences start to develop?

11:07.920 --> 11:12.920
Most likely, it is the main group of positions.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.920
The main key business group of positions.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.920
If it is a trading company,

11:17.920 --> 11:21.920
then the professional competences of the personnel service

11:21.920 --> 11:25.920
will start to develop for the sales department specialists.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.920
Because it is, let's say, an earning group.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.920
If it is a production company,

11:30.920 --> 11:33.920
then professional competences will start to develop

11:33.920 --> 11:36.920
for the employees of the production unit.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.920
Because it is these employees we pay more attention to.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.920
These are our key employees.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.920
And these key units are serviced by them.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.920
Such as accounting, IT and personnel service.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.920
And if it is an IT company,

11:49.920 --> 11:52.920
then IT specialists will become the key group

11:52.920 --> 11:55.920
and professional competences will be developed for them.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.920
In some companies there are so-called collections

11:59.920 --> 12:02.920
of single corporate requirements,

12:02.920 --> 12:05.920
in which professional competences are prescribed.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
And, in principle, this is a very good solution

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
when you have really reached the end.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.920
And you have prepared it well in your company.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
Let's go back to the slide

12:15.920 --> 12:17.920
of the organization competence map.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.920
We talked with you about corporate competences,

12:20.920 --> 12:22.920
professional and management.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.920
It is from them that individual competences are formed

12:25.920 --> 12:28.920
or an individual profile of a position.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.920
Let's see what we see on the slide

12:31.920 --> 12:33.920
of the organization competence map.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.920
On the left we see the hierarchical levels

12:36.920 --> 12:39.920
of the organization on the Y axis.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.920
That is, all positions,

12:41.920 --> 12:44.920
starting from an ordinary employee or a performer,

12:44.920 --> 12:47.920
ending with a top manager.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.920
Let's look at the map and try to understand

12:50.920 --> 12:53.920
what competences will be, for example,

12:53.920 --> 12:55.920
in the training manager,

12:55.920 --> 12:59.920
as one of the employees of the personnel management.

12:59.920 --> 13:05.920
What competences will be his profile of a position?

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
Let's see.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.920
The training manager is, most likely, a performer.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.920
This is an employee who does not have other subordinates.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.920
Thus, he will have a large set of professional competences.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
A large set.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.920
There will be everything related to his work.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.920
About whether he knows how to do it,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.920
how he does it, how he develops training,

13:28.920 --> 13:30.920
how he conducts them,

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
how he evaluates their effectiveness, and so on.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.920
How it is necessary to be successful in this position.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.920
And also a set of corporate competences.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.920
After some time, our training manager

13:42.920 --> 13:45.920
grows to the head of the training department.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.920
And what do we see?

13:47.920 --> 13:48.920
Let's see.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.920
We see that the corporate competences

13:50.920 --> 13:53.920
remain the same set, in the same composition.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.920
But now he needs a little less professional competences,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.920
because a block of management competences has appeared.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.920
He has now become a manager.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
Now he has people in his behavior.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.920
He needs to set tasks, control them.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.920
He needs to manage his team.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.920
Well, our training manager,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
already the head of the training department,

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
is going up the career ladder.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
Now he becomes the director of the training center

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
or the director of personnel development.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
What do we see?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.920
We see that the block of management competences

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
now dominates over the professional ones.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
He is, first of all, a manager.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.920
He may remember, and probably remembers,

14:32.920 --> 14:35.920
and recalls the times when he conducted trainings

14:35.920 --> 14:37.920
for various groups.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.920
But now his main task is to plan training

14:40.920 --> 14:43.920
and to form a training system in the organization.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.920
Thus, his block of management competences is very large.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
He has fewer professional ones.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.920
And the corporate one is still in the same composition,

14:52.920 --> 14:55.920
in the same amount, which was from the very beginning.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.920
Thus, we can lay out on this map

14:58.920 --> 15:01.920
the list of all our employees.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.920
Once again, I would like to draw your attention

15:03.920 --> 15:06.920
to the fact that corporate competences are the same for everyone.

15:06.920 --> 15:11.920
Management competences are the same for all managers in the organization.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.920
And professional competences change

15:14.920 --> 15:17.920
depending on the group of positions.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
And those professional competences,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
which will be developed for the management of personnel,

15:21.920 --> 15:24.920
will naturally differ from the professional competences

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
of the financial service,

15:26.920 --> 15:29.920
logistics department, marketing department, and so on.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.920
I suggest to do the following.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.920
The distribution materials have two examples,

15:36.920 --> 15:42.920
which describe the mission and values of two companies.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.920
The first company is called Novacare.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.920
It is a pharmaceutical company.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
The next one is a metallurgical holding,

15:48.920 --> 15:52.920
a large holding, which operates in our country.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.920
I suggest to complete the following task.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.920
Get acquainted with what these companies write about themselves.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.920
What values do they declare,

16:00.920 --> 16:03.920
when they address the external environment.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
And try to formulate,

16:05.920 --> 16:09.920
being an external expert in relation to these companies,

16:09.920 --> 16:13.920
try to formulate the list of corporate competences,

16:13.920 --> 16:19.920
which can be from your point of view in these companies.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.920
What behavior is valuable in these companies?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
Try to formulate it.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.920
We have already mentioned competences several times.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.920
Let's make a definition.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.920
Competence profile or employee competence map.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.920
Individual reference model of competences,

16:40.920 --> 16:44.920
necessary for the success of a particular position.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.920
The profile is useful for the following reasons.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.920
The various positions and positions

16:53.920 --> 16:57.920
imply a different level of competence development.

16:57.920 --> 17:03.920
If we have defined one of our competences as a team work,

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
or team work,

17:05.920 --> 17:07.920
then, depending on the position,

17:07.920 --> 17:10.920
a different level of competence development is required.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
If it is an ordinary employee,

17:12.920 --> 17:15.920
then he must be able to be a team player.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.920
He should not resist team work.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
If it is a manager,

17:19.920 --> 17:23.920
he should be able to be a team player or a team member.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.920
He should be able to develop this team,

17:26.920 --> 17:28.920
form it, combine it.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.920
If it is a top manager,

17:30.920 --> 17:33.920
he should be able to manage a group of teams,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.920
because there will be several teams in the organization.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.920
To remain relevant,

17:38.920 --> 17:40.920
these profiles should be reviewed.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.920
We will remember this when we talk about evaluation events.

17:45.920 --> 17:50.920
The competence model is not something we have developed today

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
and will work with it for the next 10 years.

17:52.920 --> 17:53.920
Not at all.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.920
Whether it is a competence model or a more narrow competence profile,

17:57.920 --> 18:00.920
it should be reviewed anyway.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.920
The external environment changes,

18:02.920 --> 18:04.920
the situation inside the company changes,

18:04.920 --> 18:06.920
new goals are set.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.920
It is important to understand what behavior is valuable today.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
It is important to constantly review it

18:11.920 --> 18:13.920
and at least agree that yes,

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
what we have determined,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.920
the competencies we have determined for ourselves,

18:17.920 --> 18:20.920
they still remain a priority for us.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.920
The question is when to do it.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.920
We will talk about it when we get to the evaluation procedures,

18:27.920 --> 18:31.920
because the review and update of the competence profiles

18:31.920 --> 18:34.920
is necessary to do before the evaluation

18:34.920 --> 18:36.920
during the preparation events.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.920
So, the development of the model is a long-term project and resource-intensive.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.920
I mean not only money,

18:44.920 --> 18:50.920
but also time and effort of all specialists involved in this process.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.920
It is necessary to understand what our organization will get

18:54.920 --> 18:57.920
except for a set of competencies

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
that will work or not.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.920
Maybe not for ourselves, but for the higher management.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.920
We will report what we have.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.920
First of all, the company applies competencies

19:09.920 --> 19:12.920
to achieve the compliance of the actions.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.920
It is very important that already by accepting the employee

19:16.920 --> 19:20.920
and conducting an interview when selecting candidates,

19:20.920 --> 19:23.920
we begin to evaluate people

19:23.920 --> 19:25.920
according to the competencies that exist.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.920
It is easier to find a language for the employee,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.920
the staff and the line manager.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.920
Because the line manager does not say

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
that he did not like something,

19:36.920 --> 19:38.920
that he did not feel something.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.920
He says that everything is fine,

19:40.920 --> 19:43.920
but he does not have these professional competencies.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.920
Or their level of development is very low

19:45.920 --> 19:47.920
and he will not fit into my team.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.920
This coordination of actions allows the company

19:50.920 --> 19:53.920
to be more mobile, more flexible.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.920
And the use of competencies in all directions,

19:58.920 --> 20:02.920
in all policies, procedures, services, staff

20:02.920 --> 20:05.920
is a huge help.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.920
The next important advantage is that

20:10.920 --> 20:13.920
there is an opportunity to exchange information with employees.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.920
When the employee becomes aware of the corporate norms and rules,

20:18.920 --> 20:21.920
how it happens here, what we are,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.920
if we talk about corporate competencies.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.920
The employee also begins to receive feedback

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
about his activity.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.920
When he receives a development plan,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.920
where we write to him that everything is fine,

20:35.920 --> 20:38.920
but these two competencies need to be improved.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.920
The employee becomes aware of what we demand from him.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
And he perceives the next evaluation event

20:44.920 --> 20:47.920
as an opportunity to change the situation

20:47.920 --> 20:50.920
for the better, perhaps for promotion.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.920
And not as a kind of, let's say,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.920
he perceives without fear.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.920
He is not afraid that something will be unclear.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.920
It is necessary to experience it.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.920
And is it worth experiencing in this company?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.920
Is it easier to simply change the company?

21:05.920 --> 21:08.920
The next plus, the next benefit that the company gets

21:08.920 --> 21:11.920
are the high standards of quality and efficiency

21:11.920 --> 21:15.920
that you set when developing competencies.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
After all, it is important to understand

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
when we talk about development levels,

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
what we consider the maximum,

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
how much we achieve this maximum,

21:23.920 --> 21:25.920
what we consider the minimum.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.920
Therefore, we constantly talk about this,

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
and we want it or not,

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
but we will most likely do it with you.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.920
We will always set the highest standard

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
that is necessary,

21:37.920 --> 21:39.920
especially when it comes to professional competencies.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
In working with clients,

21:41.920 --> 21:44.920
if they are employees of the sales department.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.920
In training, if it is a training manager.

21:48.920 --> 21:53.920
In organization and implementation of logistics works,

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
if it is the logistics department.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.920
Colleagues, we talked with you about what competencies are,

22:12.920 --> 22:14.920
what a competency model is,

22:14.920 --> 22:17.920
what competencies are corporate, management, professional.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.920
We said a few words about the competencies profile.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
Now let's talk about what needs to be done

22:23.920 --> 22:25.920
to have all this.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.920
We are starting to talk about the development of a competency model.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.920
First, it is important to remember

22:32.920 --> 22:35.920
that there is no standard competency model.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
Unfortunately, it does not exist.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.920
What are the options we have in case

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
we have such a task?

22:43.920 --> 22:47.920
The first option is to look somewhere, to someone,

22:47.920 --> 22:50.920
to see what competencies are developed by someone.

22:50.920 --> 22:55.920
From this list, choose what suits us.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.920
The question is whether this method is better.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.920
Of course, no.

23:00.920 --> 23:05.920
But this does not mean that this method is not applicable in our practice.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
It all depends on those goals, on that time,

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
on those time resources,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
on the time restrictions that we have.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
And we must understand that

23:13.920 --> 23:16.920
we all come to competencies in different ways.

23:16.920 --> 23:21.920
Someone does it this way because it is the optimal way in his conditions.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.920
The next method is the development of a competency model,

23:26.920 --> 23:28.920
which is called from A to I.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.920
When in this project,

23:30.920 --> 23:33.920
and this project is recognized in the company as quite serious,

23:33.920 --> 23:37.920
it is not that the staff does something in the evenings,

23:37.920 --> 23:40.920
maybe not in the evenings, but maybe at work,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.920
maybe in the afternoon or after lunch,

23:42.920 --> 23:44.920
goes to the managers,

23:44.920 --> 23:48.920
and the managers no longer know that they come again, ask something, and so on.

23:48.920 --> 23:54.920
It is important that this is a project that includes both staff and linear managers.

23:54.920 --> 23:59.920
It is also important that the top management organization knows about this project

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
and there is support.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.920
Because, once again, the project is quite resource-intensive,

24:04.920 --> 24:08.920
and the strength and time of the employees are distracted by its implementation.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.920
When the company understands that a competency model is necessary,

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
situations can be different.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.920
I will tell you about my experience.

24:15.920 --> 24:20.920
In 2003, the company I worked for began an active regional expansion.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.920
In different cities of Russia,

24:22.920 --> 24:25.920
located thousands of kilometers from each other,

24:25.920 --> 24:28.920
we were looking for regional representatives,

24:28.920 --> 24:31.920
that is, those people who can represent people,

24:31.920 --> 24:34.920
represent the company, I'm sorry, in the region.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.920
And we must understand that the level of development of regions was completely different.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.920
And so it was not a single portrait of the person we were looking for.

24:45.920 --> 24:50.920
It all depended on the level of development of the business in the company in the region,

24:50.920 --> 24:53.920
and therefore people could be different in their competencies.

24:53.920 --> 24:58.920
Working actively together with the head of the regional department,

24:58.920 --> 25:01.920
we once again made up a profile,

25:01.920 --> 25:04.920
we did not even call it a profile,

25:04.920 --> 25:08.920
but a kind of application for the selection of a specialist.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.920
And the head, perhaps a little bit of a joke, said,

25:12.920 --> 25:16.920
listen, you know a man named Petrov,

25:16.920 --> 25:21.920
and Petrov was one of the specialists who worked in one of the regions.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.920
He worked for a long time, he was a star of such a regional scale.

25:25.920 --> 25:31.920
He said, you know what, I said yes, I know him.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.920
He said, I don't need this, I need Petrov, but two years ago.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.920
What does it mean?

25:36.920 --> 25:39.920
It means that, in other words, there were certain competencies,

25:39.920 --> 25:45.920
which this employee had, let's say, their level of development was very high.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.920
And, in principle, this was not required for the region where we were looking for now.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.920
It's good if you still knew who Petrov was and how he ran the business,

25:54.920 --> 25:56.920
and what we understand under this.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.920
And if this is covered by the selection manager,

25:58.920 --> 26:00.920
who has never seen Petrov before.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.920
This suggests that there was a need, a need in a certain single language.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.920
That this Petrov should be divided into various competencies,

26:09.920 --> 26:12.920
and say which of his competencies are needed for a future employee.

26:12.920 --> 26:17.920
Let's say, in Yekaterinburg, yes, which employee do we need in Novosibirsk,

26:17.920 --> 26:20.920
which employee is needed in Khabarovsk, and so on and so forth.

26:20.920 --> 26:25.920
This was a reason for the staff of our company to think about

26:25.920 --> 26:30.920
where exactly that language is, and whether competencies can become them.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.920
Let's say, there were not very many tools and sources at that time.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.920
Then only one book on competencies was published in Russian.

26:38.920 --> 26:45.920
Therefore, first of all, we analyzed the information that was on the Internet.

26:45.920 --> 26:49.920
And on the Internet we found such very interesting information,

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
which was called a competency guide.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.920
But here we decided that having received this guide,

26:53.920 --> 26:58.920
we will quickly form our own, because we will take from there what we need,

26:58.920 --> 27:01.920
or we will take even all the competencies, because this is a guide.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
And we will work with them.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.920
When we received this guide, there was a feeling of disappointment,

27:08.920 --> 27:13.920
because it was just a list of competencies, good competencies,

27:13.920 --> 27:17.920
but these competencies were not about us, because not everything somehow fit,

27:17.920 --> 27:20.920
and it was not about the company, and not about Petrov.

27:20.920 --> 27:24.920
And so it became clear that it was necessary to go your own way.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.920
Someone has a long way, someone has a fast way,

27:26.920 --> 27:30.920
someone has it easier, and someone has no time to do it for a long time.

27:30.920 --> 27:35.920
In order to formulate exactly those standards of behavior that are valuable to us.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.920
Thus, developing your own model of competence,

27:40.920 --> 27:43.920
each company gets an advantage.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.920
Once again, a language appears that is understandable to employees

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
and corresponds to corporate culture.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.920
And the fact that each company plays by its own rules

27:53.920 --> 27:56.920
is reflected in the model that the company creates.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.920
When preparing a project for developing a model of competence,

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
it is important to remember the following.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.920
First, you need to attract employees to the project who will use this model.

28:07.920 --> 28:14.920
Involving colleagues, involving employees of different units in the project

28:14.920 --> 28:17.920
does not mean that you should attract everyone at all stages.

28:17.920 --> 28:23.920
But this means that involvement can be limited to informing people

28:24.920 --> 28:27.920
about the goals and purposefulness of this project.

28:27.920 --> 28:33.920
And also including a number of specialists from various departments in the working group.

28:33.920 --> 28:39.920
So that people participate, people understand, they feel that they also created this.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.920
That this is not just a product developed by the staff,

28:44.920 --> 28:48.920
albeit very high quality, but nevertheless brought in from the outside.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.920
After all, they are from their point of view,

28:51.920 --> 28:54.920
which they need to use for some reason.

28:54.920 --> 28:58.920
The next thing is to provide employees with complete information

28:58.920 --> 29:01.920
about why and what is happening in the company.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.920
Why is the model of competence created?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.920
How will it be developed?

29:05.920 --> 29:08.920
How will competencies be used in work?

29:08.920 --> 29:13.920
Because it is the information of employees that prevents their possible resistance.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.920
If I don't understand something, then I'm probably against it.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
Because what else can you expect?

29:19.920 --> 29:23.920
As an example, I will give a story from the experience of one colleague,

29:23.920 --> 29:29.920
who works as a director of staff in the managing company of a large metallurgical holding.

29:29.920 --> 29:34.920
Some time ago, their company acquired another plant,

29:34.920 --> 29:37.920
which entered this holding.

29:37.920 --> 29:43.920
And they decided that it was necessary to integrate the employees of this plant

29:43.920 --> 29:46.920
into the corporate culture of the holding.

29:46.920 --> 29:50.920
And they began to conduct research aimed at understanding

29:50.920 --> 29:54.920
what are the corporate competencies of this event.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.920
They invited consultants, began to interview managers, employees,

29:58.920 --> 30:00.920
conduct interviews.

30:00.920 --> 30:05.920
What did the employees who experienced stress of absorption of their enterprise to others, not to their relatives,

30:05.920 --> 30:09.920
the first thing they encountered was an interview

30:09.920 --> 30:12.920
and some actions taken against them.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.920
They were absolutely unclear why this was necessary.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.920
There was a rumor that based on such interviews, people will be fired,

30:19.920 --> 30:21.920
and the rest of the people will be fired.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.920
It is clear that rumors spread quickly,

30:24.920 --> 30:27.920
and all this resulted in the fact that several people decided not to wait

30:27.920 --> 30:31.920
until they will be interviewed, but simply to quit the company.

30:31.920 --> 30:36.920
And it's good that in the staff service there was a person who asked himself the question,

30:36.920 --> 30:39.920
why suddenly different people from different departments,

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
suddenly, after the unification of the company,

30:42.920 --> 30:45.920
and not before, began to file a resignation letter.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.920
And it turned out that, by and large, the lack of information of employees,

30:49.920 --> 30:52.920
not paying attention to this,

30:52.920 --> 30:57.920
could lead to the fact that the company would lose those specialists who were important to it.

30:57.920 --> 31:04.920
The next principle that is important to understand when developing a model of competence

31:04.920 --> 31:11.920
is that it is important that the standards of behavior included in the competence

31:11.920 --> 31:13.920
suit all users,

31:13.920 --> 31:18.920
and the assumed form of application corresponds to corporate value.

31:18.920 --> 31:23.920
It is important that competencies should focus not only on what is valuable today,

31:23.920 --> 31:27.920
but also should take into account what will be important for us tomorrow.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.920
Because we must constantly focus on the future,

31:31.920 --> 31:35.920
and not on the strategic goals that lie ahead of our companies.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.920
I would like to draw your attention to the slide,

31:37.920 --> 31:40.920
which shows the stages of development of the competence model.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.920
Let's list them.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.920
First of all, we plan the project, we prepare it.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.920
We describe the desired result that we want to get,

31:50.920 --> 31:53.920
we analyze the resources that are at our disposal.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.920
After that, we create a project team.

31:56.920 --> 32:01.920
We begin to understand who will be involved in the development of the competence model.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.920
The third stage is the longest in terms of time,

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
the most difficult stage.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.920
Because at this stage, information is collected and analyzed,

32:11.920 --> 32:15.920
information about the behavior that exists in the company,

32:15.920 --> 32:17.920
how people work today.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.920
The result of this stage is a list of competencies.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.920
At the fourth stage, we develop the levels of each of the competencies.

32:26.920 --> 32:32.920
At the fifth stage, we form competence profiles for specific positions.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
Let's go over everything in order.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.920
So, the first stage is planning the project.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.920
It would seem that at this stage everything is clear.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.920
We need to do something, we begin to do it.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.920
Most likely, we have some kind of time limit.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.920
But the first question we should answer is

32:48.920 --> 32:52.920
why does our company need a competence model?

32:52.920 --> 32:53.920
What does it mean?

32:53.920 --> 32:56.920
There are two approaches to developing a competence model.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.920
The first one is when we solve a specific task that is in front of us.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.920
For example, we need to form a personnel reserve,

33:03.920 --> 33:06.920
select people and develop individual development plans.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.920
Or we need to select a large number of people

33:10.920 --> 33:15.920
and we need to meet the common requirements that we will propose.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.920
This is the first case.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.920
The second case is when we develop a competence model

33:20.920 --> 33:26.920
knowing that it will become a core part of the personnel management system.

33:26.920 --> 33:31.920
All the areas of the personnel service,

33:31.920 --> 33:34.920
be it selection, assessment, training, and so on,

33:34.920 --> 33:38.920
will be tied and integrated with each other.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.920
Most often, they start with the first one and move on to the second one.

33:43.920 --> 33:48.920
They start with a small piece, developing a competence model for a specific task,

33:48.920 --> 33:52.920
and then they understand that they need to work on it

33:52.920 --> 33:56.920
and understand which direction to move in

33:56.920 --> 34:00.920
to get a single model for the whole organization.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.920
Now we will talk about the second way

34:03.920 --> 34:07.920
of developing a single model of corporate competences.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.920
Nevertheless, each of you may face the fact

34:11.920 --> 34:14.920
that you will need to develop, for example,

34:14.920 --> 34:17.920
only management competences to form a reserve.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.920
Or you will need to develop professional competences

34:21.920 --> 34:23.920
for a specific group of positions.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.920
You will start with this and in the future,

34:26.920 --> 34:33.920
you will move on to get a single corporate competence model.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.920
So, we have answered the question

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
of how our model will be used,

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
when it will be integrated,

34:41.920 --> 34:44.920
and what policies and procedures it will be used for.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.920
The next important point is management support.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.920
How much are the top managers or management interested in the project?

34:52.920 --> 34:55.920
How much do they understand that it is necessary?

34:55.920 --> 34:57.920
Because, once again,

34:57.920 --> 35:00.920
the distinction between resources will be from the current activity.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.920
It is important to understand what we want to achieve.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.920
This project must be sold to the top managers,

35:06.920 --> 35:12.920
who will be involved and for whom we develop this tool.

35:12.920 --> 35:17.920
The project will be successful only when the top managers

35:17.920 --> 35:20.920
will start using this tool.

35:20.920 --> 35:24.920
The next question we answer at the first stage is

35:24.920 --> 35:26.920
how much time do we have?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.920
It is great if we can answer this question ourselves

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
and we are not limited by any time.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.920
Most often, time is limited.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.920
From my experience, I can say that this project

35:36.920 --> 35:38.920
cannot be done in a week.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
Most likely, it is impossible,

35:40.920 --> 35:43.920
if you do not close all the doors,

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
close yourself inside and do nothing

35:45.920 --> 35:48.920
except developing competences.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.920
Most often, it takes from one to three months.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.920
Someone has a project that lasts six months.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.920
Once again, the duration of the project

35:58.920 --> 36:02.920
depends on the degree of involvement of the participants in its development.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.920
How much time do we devote to this in a week?

36:05.920 --> 36:08.920
How often do we conduct work groups with employees?

36:08.920 --> 36:12.920
Do we have special people who work only within this project?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.920
Or is it an additional load

36:14.920 --> 36:17.920
of involvement in the project to the current activity?

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
A lot depends on this.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.920
Therefore, it is necessary to plan and understand

36:22.920 --> 36:25.920
what the duration of the project depends on.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.920
The next step is to create a project group.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.920
It is important to understand who will lead the project.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
There is no right answer to this question.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.920
In some organizations, it is a director of staff.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.920
In some organizations, it is a general director.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.920
On the one hand, it is strange,

36:41.920 --> 36:44.920
because the general director's involvement

36:44.920 --> 36:46.920
will be minimal.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.920
On the other hand, in those companies

36:49.920 --> 36:52.920
where the authority is very strong,

36:52.920 --> 36:55.920
it is necessary to get it in an ally,

36:55.920 --> 36:58.920
so that the employees understand

36:58.920 --> 37:01.920
who is the guide of this project.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
Most often, in large organizations,

37:03.920 --> 37:06.920
it is someone from the staff, and not always HR director.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.920
Next, it is necessary to understand

37:08.920 --> 37:11.920
who else will be included in the project team.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.920
The project team once again manages the project.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.920
It is important not to confuse project groups with working groups.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.920
Working groups are groups that are formed

37:21.920 --> 37:25.920
to solve certain tasks at certain stages of the project.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.920
If we collect information at the third stage,

37:28.920 --> 37:31.920
we can form 5 working groups of various specialists

37:31.920 --> 37:34.920
of various departments.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.920
A member of the project team can lead a working group,

37:38.920 --> 37:41.920
can be included in it.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.920
At this stage, we must understand

37:45.920 --> 37:48.920
who will enter the project team and lead the project,

37:48.920 --> 37:51.920
who will work in the working groups,

37:51.920 --> 37:54.920
who will perform the most difficult work

37:54.920 --> 37:57.920
on the collection and analysis of information.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.920
By the way, for those companies

38:00.920 --> 38:03.920
where the staff is either small

38:03.920 --> 38:06.920
or does not have the competencies

38:06.920 --> 38:09.920
in the field of information collection and analysis,

38:09.920 --> 38:12.920
for example, there are no sociologists or psychologists,

38:12.920 --> 38:15.920
for various reasons,

38:15.920 --> 38:18.920
I recommend at this stage to attract specialists from the outside,

38:18.920 --> 38:21.920
namely to determine the implementation

38:21.920 --> 38:24.920
of specific projects,

38:24.920 --> 38:27.920
not for the entire project, but for specific tasks.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.920
At the second stage of creating a project group,

38:30.920 --> 38:33.920
it is necessary to determine who, when and how we will need.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.920
Colleagues, now I propose to do the following.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.920
Analyze the needs that your companies have.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.920
If the topic of developing a competence model

38:43.920 --> 38:46.920
has interested you, then you need it.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.920
Turn around, look and try to answer

38:49.920 --> 38:52.920
the questions for yourself,

38:52.920 --> 38:55.920
which are formulated on the slides with the first and second stages.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.920
Planning of the project.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.920
1. Explaining the goal.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.920
Why does our company need a competence model?

39:04.920 --> 39:07.920
How will this model be used?

39:07.920 --> 39:10.920
1. Leadership.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.920
2. Temporary resources.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.920
3. Creating a project.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.920
Who will lead the project?

39:19.920 --> 39:22.920
How many people will be included in the working group?

39:22.920 --> 39:25.920
Who will collect and analyze the information?

39:30.920 --> 39:33.920
Why do you need this?

39:33.920 --> 39:36.920
How will your company be used?

39:36.920 --> 39:39.920
How will it be used in the project group?

39:39.920 --> 39:42.920
Try to formulate and answer these questions.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.920
It will be a good foundation for the future project.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.920
2. Designing a competence model.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.920
As I said, this is the longest stage,

39:51.920 --> 39:54.920
the most laborious.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.920
Because it is necessary to collect information,

39:57.920 --> 40:00.920
to analyze it.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.920
The result of this stage is the formation of a list of competencies.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.920
So, collecting information.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.920
Our goals.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.920
1. We need to collect examples of behavior standards,

40:12.920 --> 40:15.920
which ensure effective performance of the work.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.920
2. We need to determine the standards

40:18.920 --> 40:21.920
that may be required for effective performance of the work in the future.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.920
Where can we get this information?

40:24.920 --> 40:27.920
We need to collect the information

40:27.920 --> 40:30.920
and analyze it.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.920
3. We need to understand how the company works today,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.920
what kind of work behavior is stimulated by the company,

40:36.920 --> 40:39.920
and what actions lead to effective performance of the work.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.920
First of all, we have a number of sources

40:42.920 --> 40:45.920
from which we can get this information.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.920
Some sources answer the question who,

40:48.920 --> 40:51.920
the other part answers the question what.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.920
If we talk about who we need in this project,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.920
we need to understand who is responsible for the work.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.920
We need to ask the employees themselves

41:00.920 --> 41:03.920
how they do their job,

41:03.920 --> 41:06.920
what they do to achieve these results.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.920
We can ask the employees about their colleagues,

41:09.920 --> 41:12.920
we can ask the managers,

41:12.920 --> 41:15.920
we can ask the clients

41:15.920 --> 41:18.920
if we work in the service business,

41:18.920 --> 41:21.920
in the business of the company.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.920
We can ask the employees about their colleagues,

41:24.920 --> 41:27.920
if they work with us for a long time,

41:27.920 --> 41:30.920
they can answer the questions

41:30.920 --> 41:33.920
what behavior, what actions

41:33.920 --> 41:36.920
they evaluate as excellent.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.920
The next important source of information

41:39.920 --> 41:42.920
that is often forgotten is the mentors and the coaches.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.920
They should be asked.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.920
If they are mentors in production,

41:48.920 --> 41:51.920
their work is about the work of the coaches.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.920
If we have a training center,

41:54.920 --> 41:57.920
the programs are developed to improve the professionalism

41:57.920 --> 42:00.920
of our employees,

42:00.920 --> 42:03.920
to develop their professional competencies.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.920
These are the people,

42:06.920 --> 42:09.920
these are the categories of employees

42:09.920 --> 42:12.920
from which we need to start

42:12.920 --> 42:15.920
and involve in the project team.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.920
The next part of the sources answers the question

42:25.920 --> 42:28.920
what are the documents?

42:28.920 --> 42:31.920
What documents?

42:31.920 --> 42:34.920
Of course, it all depends on what documents we have.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.920
It is important to remember that there is always

42:37.920 --> 42:40.920
a number of documents at the level of the entire enterprise.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.920
Someone has a strategic plan, a business plan,

42:43.920 --> 42:46.920
it is formulated strategic goals if it is a public company.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.920
It is a mission, it is a corporate code,

42:49.920 --> 42:52.920
it is a business plan, etc.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.920
There are companies where there is nothing,

42:55.920 --> 42:58.920
where everything is there, but nothing works.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.920
We should approach the tools that are used by employees

43:01.920 --> 43:04.920
in their daily activities.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.920
Thus, documents at the company level,

43:07.920 --> 43:10.920
documents at the level of the division,

43:10.920 --> 43:13.920
and documents at the level of the employee.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.920
This is a duty instruction, for example,

43:16.920 --> 43:19.920
and so on.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.920
Maybe someone will say that our duty instructions do not work.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.920
They were written many years ago,

43:25.920 --> 43:28.920
and now they are waiting for guests from the labor inspection.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.920
It happens.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.920
But even in such companies, for example,

43:34.920 --> 43:37.920
there may be a memory of the cashier's salesman

43:37.920 --> 43:40.920
how to work with the buyers.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.920
From this memory, we will draw information

43:43.920 --> 43:46.920
about how our company provides effective performance of the work of the cashier,

43:46.920 --> 43:49.920
that is, quality service of the buyers and visitors.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.920
So, we have determined the sources that are in our disposal.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.920
Now a few words about the methods of collecting information.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.920
These are various methods.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.920
It can be an analysis of the work or observation of the employee's activity.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.920
It can be a survey of the employees' activities.

44:12.920 --> 44:15.920
It can be a survey or an interview.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.920
It can be a focus group of brainstorming,

44:18.920 --> 44:21.920
a working group of employees and managers.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.920
It is important for us to understand what methods are applicable

44:24.920 --> 44:27.920
in our particular case to work with a certain group of employees.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.920
It is clear that we can use the observation method

44:30.920 --> 44:33.920
for the salesman in the sales hall,

44:33.920 --> 44:36.920
but we will not be able to observe the accountant

44:36.920 --> 44:39.920
to collect the behavior standards

44:39.920 --> 44:42.920
that he uses in his work.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.920
The survey is a very difficult thing.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.920
It is difficult to formulate complex and incomprehensible questions

44:48.920 --> 44:51.920
about the qualities of an employee's ability

44:51.920 --> 44:54.920
to be successful in a certain position

44:54.920 --> 44:57.920
in a certain survey.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.920
It is possible, but probably not necessary.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.920
Because by filling out such survey lists,

45:03.920 --> 45:06.920
employees can simply unsubscribe

45:06.920 --> 45:09.920
and we will not get the valid information that we need.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.920
The best way is an interview.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.920
It is a conversation.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.920
It is a situation when we prepare the questions that we need.

45:18.920 --> 45:21.920
Even if we somehow lead the employee to the answers that we need,

45:21.920 --> 45:24.920
we get the information that we need.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.920
In addition to the interview,

45:27.920 --> 45:30.920
the next most frequently used questions

45:30.920 --> 45:33.920
are the questions that we ask the employee.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.920
The next most frequently used tool

45:36.920 --> 45:39.920
is the holding of work groups.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.920
Work groups are within one unit.

45:42.920 --> 45:45.920
Work groups are for, say, a one-level manager.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.920
Work groups are for employees of two units

45:48.920 --> 45:51.920
so that they can evaluate each other

45:51.920 --> 45:54.920
if they are very active in their activities.

45:54.920 --> 45:57.920
There are several other methods

45:57.920 --> 46:00.920
that help us a lot during this project.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.920
This is the method of repertory grids,

46:03.920 --> 46:06.920
the method of critical incidents,

46:06.920 --> 46:09.920
the method of direct attributes.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.920
Let's open them and see what it is.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.920
The method of repertory grids is as follows.

46:15.920 --> 46:18.920
The head of the unit fills out a table.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.920
We can present the information in the form of such a table

46:21.920 --> 46:24.920
in which the names of his subordinates are listed vertically.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.920
There may be key employees

46:27.920 --> 46:30.920
if the unit is very large.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.920
The above are the skills and qualities

46:33.920 --> 46:36.920
that are required for successful work.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.920
The head fills out and describes

46:39.920 --> 46:42.920
how each of the subordinates

46:42.920 --> 46:45.920
shows the skills and qualities that are necessary.

46:45.920 --> 46:48.920
It turns out that someone does well.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.920
For example, if this is the head of the sales department

46:51.920 --> 46:54.920
and he fills out this table for sales managers,

46:54.920 --> 46:57.920
we see that someone best establishes

46:57.920 --> 47:00.920
and establishes partnerships with the client,

47:00.920 --> 47:03.920
establishes relations.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.920
He best negotiates meetings by phone.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.920
Another employee does the presentation

47:09.920 --> 47:12.920
because he knows the product,

47:12.920 --> 47:15.920
benefits, advantages of the product or service.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.920
Someone works with objections.

47:18.920 --> 47:21.920
Thus, we get a solution

47:21.920 --> 47:24.920
and a grid.

47:24.920 --> 47:27.920
Therefore, the method of repertory grids

47:27.920 --> 47:30.920
includes various examples of the behavior of employees

47:30.920 --> 47:33.920
among which we can choose

47:33.920 --> 47:36.920
how successful they are.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.920
It is not necessary that they belong to someone.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.920
Thus, we are the developers of this project

47:42.920 --> 47:45.920
and get a matrix with behavior standards.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.920
It is important to note that

47:49.920 --> 47:52.920
when filling out such tables,

47:52.920 --> 47:55.920
such grids, it is important to help the head

47:55.920 --> 47:58.920
or explain very well how and what he needs to do.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.920
Because later

48:01.920 --> 48:04.920
we will check the behavior standards

48:04.920 --> 48:07.920
during the working group,

48:07.920 --> 48:10.920
in which those employees may be present.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.920
The employees described in this table

48:13.920 --> 48:16.920
will be attended by the same head, possibly by the client.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.920
We will constantly check the validity of the information

48:20.920 --> 48:23.920
during the whole stage.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.920
We will check how valuable and objective the information is.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.920
The next method is the method of critical incidents

48:29.920 --> 48:32.920
that allows us to determine

48:32.920 --> 48:35.920
the behavioral reactions

48:35.920 --> 48:38.920
that were important in a certain critical situation.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.920
We organize and conduct a structured interview

48:41.920 --> 48:44.920
for employees, their leaders, their colleagues,

48:45.920 --> 48:48.920
asking them to tell about a situation

48:48.920 --> 48:51.920
that really happened in their work.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
In such cases,

48:54.920 --> 48:57.920
either a serious mistake was made

48:57.920 --> 49:00.920
or an important success was achieved.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.920
We will also ask them about their actions

49:03.920 --> 49:06.920
and how they behaved in order to succeed.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.920
Or vice versa, if there was a mistake,

49:09.920 --> 49:12.920
what they did not do in that case

49:12.920 --> 49:15.920
and how they behaved in that situation.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.920
The next method is the method of direct attributes.

49:18.920 --> 49:21.920
Within this method,

49:21.920 --> 49:24.920
the line leaders are offered

49:24.920 --> 49:27.920
a description of the ready competencies.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.920
We ask them to evaluate them

49:30.920 --> 49:33.920
and compare them in pairs

49:33.920 --> 49:36.920
to determine the most important ones.

49:36.920 --> 49:39.920
This method is good to use

49:39.920 --> 49:42.920
when you have already formulated competencies

49:42.920 --> 49:45.920
and have already gone a long way

49:45.920 --> 49:48.920
for testing them.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.920
It will be very interesting

49:51.920 --> 49:54.920
if the competencies that you have recognized as important

49:54.920 --> 49:57.920
are not chosen by the top managers

49:57.920 --> 50:00.920
and they say that this is not the most important thing in their work.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.920
This is a kind of verification.

50:03.920 --> 50:06.920
We have said several times

50:06.920 --> 50:09.920
that we ask such questions to our employees or managers.

50:09.920 --> 50:12.920
You will get the answer to the question you ask.

50:12.920 --> 50:15.920
But we need a definite answer.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.920
We need an answer about standard behaviors.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.920
So, what do we ask?

50:21.920 --> 50:24.920
We always formulate a list of questions at home.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.920
We are always preparing for this.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.920
As an example, what kind of question can it be?

50:30.920 --> 50:33.920
We can ask what qualities should an employee have

50:33.920 --> 50:36.920
to be successful in his or her position?

50:36.920 --> 50:39.920
In response to this question,

50:39.920 --> 50:42.920
we will get a list of qualities,

50:42.920 --> 50:45.920
characteristics,

50:45.920 --> 50:48.920
knowledge about what is necessary

50:48.920 --> 50:51.920
for success in the position we are analyzing.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.920
Our next question will be

50:54.920 --> 50:57.920
how it will be manifested at the behavioral level.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.920
If competencies are behavior,

51:00.920 --> 51:03.920
then you need to know something and be able to do something.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.920
Therefore, we introduce the interviewer

51:06.920 --> 51:09.920
to the behavior level.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.920
How will it be expressed

51:12.920 --> 51:15.920
in the daily activities of the employee?

51:15.920 --> 51:18.920
The next question that must be asked

51:18.920 --> 51:21.920
is whether the selected competencies are really important.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.920
Maybe the employees have these competencies,

51:24.920 --> 51:27.920
but it is not the case

51:27.920 --> 51:30.920
that they are the most important.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.920
It is good that we have it,

51:33.920 --> 51:36.920
but it is important to define the priority.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.920
The next important question is

51:39.920 --> 51:42.920
whether we can collect information

51:42.920 --> 51:45.920
to evaluate the employee on these competencies.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.920
For example,

51:48.920 --> 51:51.920
very often companies define such a competency

51:51.920 --> 51:54.920
as loyalty.

51:55.920 --> 51:58.920
This is a very valuable competency.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.920
It is often related to the category of corporate.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.920
Very often companies say that it is important

52:04.920 --> 52:07.920
that our employees are loyal to us.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.920
Only then this competency can be recognized

52:10.920 --> 52:13.920
and voiced as a corporate competency.

52:13.920 --> 52:16.920
When you have decided for yourself

52:16.920 --> 52:19.920
how you will understand whether an employee is loyal or not.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.920
He says about it,

52:23.920 --> 52:26.920
but he is not loyal.

52:26.920 --> 52:29.920
Someone is silent,

52:29.920 --> 52:32.920
but in his actions he shows a high level of loyalty.

52:32.920 --> 52:35.920
This is necessary to answer at the stage of collecting information.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.920
Can we collect it or not?

52:38.920 --> 52:41.920
How will we collect it?

52:41.920 --> 52:44.920
Because later, having this information,

52:44.920 --> 52:47.920
it will be easier for us to formulate

52:47.920 --> 52:50.920
the competencies that we will choose as the main ones

52:50.920 --> 52:53.920
The next step in this stage is

52:53.920 --> 52:56.920
the analysis of the information.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.920
If we did everything right and qualitatively,

52:59.920 --> 53:02.920
we collected a large amount of information.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.920
What do we need to do?

53:05.920 --> 53:08.920
We need to analyze

53:08.920 --> 53:11.920
what is priority and what is not.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.920
We need to develop a general structure of the competency model.

53:14.920 --> 53:17.920
We need to develop the priorities that are necessary.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.920
My recommendation is that

53:20.920 --> 53:23.920
this work is done in the framework of additional working groups

53:23.920 --> 53:26.920
that are made up of the most active participants

53:26.920 --> 53:29.920
who have shown themselves at the stage of collecting information.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.920
My recommendation is to duplicate the work.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.920
What does it mean?

53:35.920 --> 53:38.920
It means that you conduct one, two or even three working groups

53:38.920 --> 53:41.920
that are dedicated to the same issue.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.920
It is necessary to develop a list of competencies.

53:44.920 --> 53:47.920
All three groups are developed in the same list of competencies

53:47.920 --> 53:50.920
so that later, having presented their results to each other,

53:50.920 --> 53:53.920
they can discuss and come to a consensus.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.920
This method works very well

53:56.920 --> 53:59.920
when you work with a group of linear leaders

53:59.920 --> 54:02.920
and formulate corporate competencies.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.920
By dividing the linear leaders into several groups

54:05.920 --> 54:08.920
and suggesting each of the groups

54:08.920 --> 54:11.920
to determine the corporate competencies

54:11.920 --> 54:14.920
that you will include in the future model,

54:14.920 --> 54:17.920
you will see how the leaders,

54:17.920 --> 54:20.920
having first joined the work within their group,

54:20.920 --> 54:23.920
will either protect their developments

54:23.920 --> 54:26.920
or accept others' work.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.920
In any case, it is necessary to reach a compromise

54:29.920 --> 54:32.920
by discussing it within the entire group.

54:32.920 --> 54:35.920
Therefore, we must duplicate the analytical work.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.920
After that, we discuss.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.920
After that, we choose a name.

54:41.920 --> 54:44.920
The name should be short and concise.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.920
The name of the competency should characterize

54:47.920 --> 54:50.920
its future content as much as possible.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.920
It is important to understand that each company is unique

54:53.920 --> 54:56.920
and each company has its own language.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.920
There are many disputes about the competence of leadership.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.920
Some companies declare this competence

55:02.920 --> 55:05.920
as a corporate one,

55:05.920 --> 55:08.920
while others declare it as a managerial one.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.920
Some companies declare leadership

55:11.920 --> 55:14.920
as a concept that cannot be measured.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.920
A person was born a leader or not.

55:17.920 --> 55:20.920
There are no right or wrong.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.920
It is important to understand how we have determined this competence.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.920
When we talk about leadership,

55:26.920 --> 55:29.920
we describe a competent leader

55:29.920 --> 55:32.920
and, in fact, we fill it with the definition of the competence of work.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.920
If we define it as a person,

55:35.920 --> 55:38.920
a manager, a team manager,

55:38.920 --> 55:41.920
it is our own choice.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.920
The way we call it, the way we define it

55:44.920 --> 55:47.920
is only our choice.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.920
Thus, competencies that are called the same

55:50.920 --> 55:53.920
in different companies can have completely different meanings

55:53.920 --> 55:56.920
and describe completely different behavior.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.920
At this stage,

55:59.920 --> 56:02.920
we need to eliminate the repetition.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.920
Competencies, what is important,

56:05.920 --> 56:08.920
should not be crossed.

56:08.920 --> 56:11.920
What does it mean to cross?

56:11.920 --> 56:14.920
As an example, a company defines competence

56:14.920 --> 56:17.920
as a professionalism.

56:17.920 --> 56:20.920
Let's start with the fact that this competence is not quite clear.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.920
Professionalism is a professional competence.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.920
But there are companies that take it to the corporate level.

56:26.920 --> 56:29.920
There is also a competence, for example,

56:29.920 --> 56:32.920
as an orientation to development.

56:32.920 --> 56:35.920
We value those who study, we study ourselves,

56:35.920 --> 56:38.920
we create an environment in which our employees study.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.920
On the one hand, these are two different competencies.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.920
On the other hand, we must always understand what professionalism is.

56:44.920 --> 56:47.920
Professionalism, when it is defined as a corporate competence,

56:47.920 --> 56:50.920
that is, for all employees,

56:50.920 --> 56:53.920
and does not carry a narrowly specialized direction,

56:53.920 --> 56:56.920
is often understood as a skill to learn,

56:56.920 --> 56:59.920
a desire to learn, to develop, and so on.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.920
It may turn out that we are talking about the same thing,

57:02.920 --> 57:05.920
although the competencies are called differently.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.920
How to check?

57:08.920 --> 57:11.920
It is very easy to check.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.920
You need to find an employee who has,

57:14.920 --> 57:17.920
and in general, answer the question,

57:17.920 --> 57:20.920
whether this can be the case in our company,

57:20.920 --> 57:23.920
if he is very professional,

57:23.920 --> 57:26.920
but absolutely oriented to development.

57:26.920 --> 57:29.920
If we cross these competencies,

57:29.920 --> 57:32.920
we will answer that this cannot be the case.

57:32.920 --> 57:35.920
If this cannot be the case, then the competencies are probably the same.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.920
Can we check another competence,

57:38.920 --> 57:41.920
an orientation to development and a team player?

57:41.920 --> 57:44.920
Are these competencies different or similar?

57:44.920 --> 57:47.920
We must remember a person who is oriented to development,

57:47.920 --> 57:50.920
but at the same time not a team player.

57:50.920 --> 57:53.920
Can it be so? Of course it can.

57:53.920 --> 57:56.920
And vice versa. A person who is a team player,

57:56.920 --> 57:59.920
who, let's say, sets the goals of the team above his own,

57:59.920 --> 58:02.920
but at the same time is absolutely not oriented to development.

58:02.920 --> 58:05.920
It can be so. And it can be so.

58:05.920 --> 58:08.920
Thus, these competencies do not intersect,

58:08.920 --> 58:11.920
and we can include both of these competencies in our model.

58:11.920 --> 58:14.920
The next thing we do at this stage is to check validity.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.920
This means that every time we understand and look at,

58:17.920 --> 58:20.920
let's say, those lights, that compass,

58:20.920 --> 58:23.920
that we are going the right way.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.920
Are the employees who demonstrate competence

58:26.920 --> 58:29.920
really doing their job more effectively

58:29.920 --> 58:32.920
than those who do not demonstrate?

58:32.920 --> 58:35.920
What does it mean?

58:35.920 --> 58:38.920
It means that the competencies that we have recognized as priority,

58:38.920 --> 58:41.920
are they really owned by those employees

58:41.920 --> 58:44.920
who are successful today?

58:44.920 --> 58:47.920
It should be so.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.920
If it is different, and we made a mistake

58:50.920 --> 58:53.920
and took the wrong direction, and prioritized the wrong competencies,

58:53.920 --> 58:56.920
it will turn out that we will somehow get off the road

58:56.920 --> 58:59.920
to a dead end, which is not clear where it will lead us.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.920
Therefore, at the stage of the demo,

59:02.920 --> 59:05.920
we always test and check.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.920
After all, we wrote it down and took these behavior standards

59:09.920 --> 59:12.920
from the activities of the best employees.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.920
In general, the circle will close and everything should coincide.

59:15.920 --> 59:18.920
But it is necessary to check every time.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.920
Because if we define other priorities for our company,

59:21.920 --> 59:24.920
it means that we will lead the company in a different direction,

59:24.920 --> 59:27.920
that we will stimulate and develop some other behavior.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.920
This can only be in one case,

59:30.920 --> 59:33.920
if the company strategy has changed.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.920
If yesterday we were aggressive, we seized the market,

59:37.920 --> 59:40.920
we valued competencies from this area,

59:40.920 --> 59:43.920
and today we said that the market is at our feet.

59:43.920 --> 59:46.920
We are improving the quality, we are talking about the service, etc.

59:46.920 --> 59:49.920
In this case, there may be a departure

59:49.920 --> 59:52.920
from the main road to another road.

59:52.920 --> 59:55.920
But only if we understand this initially and set it up initially.

59:55.920 --> 59:58.920
If there were no such drastic changes in our strategy,

59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.920
then again.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.920
And those competencies that we have determined

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.920
must be consistent with the behavior

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.920
that our effective employees show in their work today.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.920
As we have already said, the result of this stage

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.920
is a formulated list of competencies.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.920
Let's look at the slides,

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.920
which show a number of examples

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.920
with corporate competencies models of various companies.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.920
Let's look and comment on them.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.920
At the first stage,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.920
we see a model of competencies

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.920
consisting of 11 competencies,

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.920
which are divided into 3 clusters.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.920
Under the clusters, competencies can be combined into one group.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.920
Here we see 3 clusters.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.920
Business development, achievement of results, work with people.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.920
Please note that here we do not see a list of professional,

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.920
administrative and corporate competencies.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.920
Most likely,

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.920
work with people will be administrative competencies

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.920
or at least leadership competencies.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.920
Administrative competencies will include

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.920
business vision and goal setting

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.920
from the achievement of results cluster.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.920
Please note that the presentation of the competency model

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.920
and its final formulation

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.920
are always our choice.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.920
The next slide shows a model of competencies

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.920
which includes 8 competencies,

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.920
including 3 corporate competencies,

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.920
3 administrative competencies

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.920
and 3 professional competencies

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.920
for sales department employees.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.920
The next slide shows a model of competencies

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.920
which includes 16 competencies

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.920
divided into 5 clusters.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920
This is a question of the limit of competencies.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.920
Once again,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.920
competencies should be as many as you can work with.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.920
There are examples where competencies can be 4 or 5.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.920
There can be competencies for employees or managers.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.920
Once again,

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.920
this choice is made by each company

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.920
depending on the goals it set for itself

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.920
at the very beginning

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.920
and the tasks for which competencies were developed.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.920
The more competencies a model has,

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.920
the more difficult it is to apply it.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.920
It is difficult to highlight specific competencies

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.920
in an excessively detailed model

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.920
because the differences between individual competencies

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.920
in such a model can be incredibly small.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Therefore, do not chase a large number of competencies.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.920
Do not say that you have 20,

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.920
or 18, or 15 competencies.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.920
Formulate 10, but they are for employees.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.920
You will use them in all policies and procedures

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.920
of the staff management.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.920
You will use them during selection,

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.920
during evaluation activities.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.920
You will develop competencies for employees

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.920
and develop them for them.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.920
The next step is to develop the level of competencies.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920
The next step is to develop competencies for employees.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.920
At this stage, we solve several tasks.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.920
First, we determine

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.920
the level of competencies.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.920
What are the options?

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.920
First, competencies can be undetailed

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.920
or simple.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Thus, the company sets a certain level

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.920
and a certain behavior

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.920
that is necessary for the company

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.920
Let's return to loyalty.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920
Loyalty can be difficult to break down by levels.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.920
The company defines that a loyal employee

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.920
is the employee who does not harm the company.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.920
Let him not shout about us at every corner.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.920
Let him not walk around in the company's logos.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.920
Let him not be a part of the company's activities.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.920
Let him not be a part of the company's activities.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.920
Let him not be a part of the company's activities.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Let him not walk around in the company's logos.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.920
Let him behave ethically towards the company.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.920
Let him not speak out against the company's decisions.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.920
Let him not speak out against the company's decisions.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.920
Let him not speak out against the company's decisions.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.920
It is a simple but undetailed competence.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.920
But the company develops competencies

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.920
to understand

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.920
what is needed to take the next step.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Development programs are developed

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.920
to achieve the next level.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.920
The question is, how many levels are needed?

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.920
You answer this question yourself

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.920
because there are no standard answers.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.920
It can be 4 levels, 3 levels, 7 levels.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.920
In my practice, I have encountered companies

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.920
that have a 7-level model of competence

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.920
consisting of 10 competencies

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.920
and it works perfectly

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.920
because everything is clearly defined.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.920
So, how many?

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.920
Usually, it is 4 levels.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.920
The next important step

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.920
is to define the minimum and maximum

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.920
level of competence development.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.920
What is the minimum?

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.920
Let's look at the following slides

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.920
and see how it is defined.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.920
Let's take the example of competence

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.920
of working with clients.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.920
We can see that this competence

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.920
consists of 4 levels.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.920
The first level is

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.920
a level of competence development

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.920
that corresponds to this level.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.920
It can find a common language with people.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.920
Can this behavior be sufficient

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.920
for a certain position in our organization?

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.920
Yes, it can.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.920
It can be a beginner, a sales specialist.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.920
Thus, we understand that this first level

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.920
is a working level, acceptable for us.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.920
What about the first level

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.920
of competence and persistence?

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Let's look at the first level.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.920
A person can refuse a planned plan

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.920
when facing difficulties.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.920
In some cases, his plans and projects

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.920
are unfinished.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.920
He does not strive to overcome obstacles

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.920
in achieving goals,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.920
and difficulties can stop him

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.920
from achieving his plans.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.920
Can such a person be a member of our company?

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.920
Despite the fact that in competence and persistence

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.920
we see 3 levels of development,

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.920
we understand that the first level

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.920
is a non-working level.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.920
It will never be acceptable for any position.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.920
There will be 2 working levels.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.920
The level of competence and the level of skill.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.920
This is an example of a 3-level model

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.920
with 2 working levels.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.920
This is an example of a 4-level model

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.920
with 4 working levels.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.920
We need to determine

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.920
what the first level will be.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.920
Will it be positive or negative?

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.920
How do our colleagues answer this question?

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.920
It is easier to start with working levels,

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.920
as in the case of competence

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.920
and working with clients.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.920
This way we will make our lives easier

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.920
and will not formulate the non-working level

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.920
for all competencies in our model.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.920
But we will understand that

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.920
if this is the first level,

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.920
we will always have a zero

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.920
when competence is not developed.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.920
When even this is not required

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.920
at the initial level.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.920
Other companies say

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.920
that they want to define

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.920
the working level

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.920
and explain to everyone

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.920
that if it does not correspond,

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920
then do not mark anything

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.920
or do not put it on the axis.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.920
Therefore, I formulate this zero level

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.920
for all competencies.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.920
We answer this question.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.920
We are talking about determining

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.920
the minimum level.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.920
What is the most desirable for us?

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.920
What will be the 4th level

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.920
or the level of skill?

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.920
It is very important not to raise to heaven

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.920
that we do not have such people

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.920
and will never have them.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.920
We can choose from the practice

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.920
or from the strong specialists.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.920
We can say that these are our standards

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.920
and we would like all our employees

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.920
to behave in the same way.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.920
Or if we do not have such specialists

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.920
for any reason,

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.920
then we define the desired level

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.920
and try to remain as objective as possible.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.920
We want to have a level

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.920
where this level would be required

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920
and it would be possible to develop

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.920
or find a person with such a level of competence.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.920
The next step is to check the validity

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.920
or value of the level of competence

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.920
relative to real activity.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.920
After determining the level,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.920
the next step will be to form the profiles of positions.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.920
We will arrange the profiles of positions

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.920
in relation to the levels.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.920
Take a few positions from different areas

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.920
and put them on the profiles.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.920
Does it work or not?

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.920
Does it work objectively or does it look strange

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.920
that all employees should have the highest level of development

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.920
in several positions?

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.920
Maybe something has not been worked out?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.920
Maybe you have determined that the competencies

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.920
do not correspond to each other.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.920
For example, by revealing the competence

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.920
of the orientation to development,

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.920
you have taken a very big step between levels.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.920
By revealing the competence of working in a team,

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.920
you have taken small steps.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.920
And, accordingly, the competencies are not valid

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.920
relative to each other.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.920
The next step is a kind of reward.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.920
Only those who have not turned the way

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.920
at the stages of formulating the list

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.920
and at the fourth stage of the level development

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.920
can reach it.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.920
At this stage, we form the profiles of competencies

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.920
for specific positions.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.920
Our goals.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.920
First, we need to check

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.920
whether the competencies

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.920
exactly correspond to all the working roles

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.920
that exist in the company.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.920
How do we do it?

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.920
We do not do it on our own.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.920
It is important that the line managers do it,

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.920
the leaders of those units for which we form the profiles of positions.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.920
If the line manager understands how to do it,

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.920
it means that we have developed a convenient model.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.920
If he does not understand,

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.920
it means that we work together with him,

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.920
helping him and getting feedback.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.920
If he cannot define a certain competence,

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.920
it may not be the most important competence.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.920
We get answers to these questions

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.920
during this stage.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.920
Ideally, we need to form the profiles of those positions

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.920
for which we will later carry out

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.920
evaluation activities.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.920
This is the beginning.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.920
This is the first and most important thing.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.920
This is the project to be developed.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.920
Ideally, it is the development of the profiles of positions

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.920
for all the positions of our company.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.920
Pay attention to the following slides

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.920
where the profile of the position of the regional representative is given.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.920
On two different slides,

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.920
you can see two options for presenting the profile of the position.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.920
It can be either in the form of a table

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.920
in which the level of development is indicated.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.920
In fact, with such a table,

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.920
you come to the line manager

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.920
and offer to define and create a profile

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.920
for the position of his unit,

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.920
when there is a list of competencies

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.920
and when there is a description of each of the levels

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.920
for each competence.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.920
The manager, reading the profile,

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.920
understands what he wants to correspond to.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.920
Another option is in the form of a web page.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.920
This web page is very convenient to use

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.920
because at first we can put the required level of development

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.920
or the profile of the position on it,

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.920
and after the evaluation procedures,

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.920
we put the current level of development of our employees' competencies.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.920
We can clearly see where there are some gaps.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.920
Let's think about it.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.920
In our example, there are 11 competencies.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.920
If the level of development is lower for each of the three competencies,

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.920
it means that it is very clear

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.920
that these are the competencies that require development

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.920
and that development plans must be formed for these competencies.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.920
The next slide shows the level of development of the position.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.920
The level of development of the position is very high.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.920
It means that development plans must be formed for these competencies.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.920
Or vice versa.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.920
When the current level of the employee exceeds the required level,

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.920
then it is a signal that this employee must be retained.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.920
Or we include him in the personnel reserve.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.920
But there are not always opportunities

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.920
for including him in the personnel reserve.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.920
Therefore, in any case,

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.920
we must understand that the level of development of the competence

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.920
of the employee is very high

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.920
and we need to use it.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.920
We can involve him as a mentor,

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.920
as a functional coach in our training project for other employees.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.920
In any case, this is a signal

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.920
that the employee must be retained.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.920
Unfortunately, this is the contradiction of our life.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.920
First, we invest funds in the development of the competence of our employees.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.920
If we are successful,

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.920
then we invest funds in the development of the competence of our employees.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.920
If we are interested,

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.920
then we invest funds in the development of the competence of our employees.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.920
So, we have discussed our main actions

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.920
at various stages of the project

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.920
on the development of the competence model.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.920
We have discussed the stage of preparation of the project

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.920
and the formation of the project team.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.920
We have discussed what we do,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.920
and we analyze the information at the stage of formulating the list of competencies.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.920
The next stage is the development of the level of competence models.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.920
And it all ends with the fact that we develop the profiles of the positions.
