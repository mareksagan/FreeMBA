00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the role of a student of the Economic University?

00:05.000 --> 00:14.000
Good afternoon. Imagine that you are a student of the Economic University, who studied the basic economic and management disciplines for two years,

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
the basics of macro and microeconomics, the basics of management, the basics of marketing, and so on.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Well, in general, he met with the university students.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
Now he needs to choose a specialization for himself in order to become a cool professional in the field.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
It can be marketing, it can be logistics, it can be accounting, it can be controlling.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
And the student thinks about how to make this choice.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
He looks at the coin and thinks that, in principle, this choice can be made strategically by throwing the coin.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
If the coin falls to the floor and the eagle falls, then he can choose marketing for himself.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
If it falls to the top, then he will choose logistics for himself.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
If it hangs in the air, then it will be accounting.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
If the coin is on the edge, then it will be controlling.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.000
The second option is that he can look around, try to analyze what professions will be in demand in the market in the near future.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
And also look inside, close your eyes and think about what talents and inclinations I have, what attracts me the most.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
If this is a creative personality, then, of course, he will choose accounting for himself, remembering such a term as creative accounting.

01:36.000 --> 01:48.000
Companies, businesses often have the same situations when you understand that everything that has been so far cannot remain so and further.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
You need to live differently and you think where to go, to the right, to the left or straight.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Companies often face the problem of a cardinal breakdown of the party's general line.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
And in order to do this consciously, they have to do a strategic analysis.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Analysis of the external environment, analysis of oneself.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
We will discuss the key tools that can be used to make this analysis.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
My name is Vladislav Tolkach. I am the director of the Academy of Controlling.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
This is the main place of my work.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
This project is implemented by the joint efforts of the German School of Business and the Academy Controller.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I am a practicing business coach and consultant.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
I specialize in the topic of strategy, organizational development and, of course, controlling.

02:46.000 --> 02:59.000
The main tools of strategic analysis that we will discuss are used to understand the environment of the external environment in which our company operates.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
There is a PEST analysis, or it is also called STEP.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
This is an abbreviation of four English words.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
This is an analysis of the political, economic, social and technological environment.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
If you make an abbreviation, it turns out either PEST or STEP.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
The second tool allows you to understand your industry.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
Here I must mention the work of the guru of strategic management, Michael Porter,

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
who, for the sake of understanding his industry, recommends to businessmen to analyze competition, as well as the power of substitutes.

03:39.000 --> 03:51.000
These are products from adjacent industries that can gnaw money from the pie that we and our competitors in our industry claim.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Here is the analysis of customers and suppliers.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
The fifth tool is the so-called entry barriers.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
This is what prevents potential players from breaking into our industry.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
The third tool is the analysis of the factors of success in the industry.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
In principle, it is a summary of the entire previous work.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
When we rewrite all the issues that should be solved in our industry, if we want to earn something,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
we need to work on them.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
However, these issues are usually divided into two parts.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
The first part is the basic issues that allow us to play football,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
allow us to play on the football field, but do not guarantee us a win.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
The second part is the so-called strategic issues.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
If we work strategically, we have a chance to win football.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
The fourth tool is the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
This is the analysis of the company itself, what is good and what is not very good at the moment.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
The summary tool that summarizes the entire previous analytical work is the so-called SWOT analysis.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
This is again an English-language abbreviation.

05:01.000 --> 05:11.000
These four letters mean again the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the list of threats, opportunities and threats.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
The last part of our course is the organizational aspects.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
We will talk about how to do this analysis better, who to call to a strategic meeting, how to distribute roles.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
These are the nuances that we will discuss in the last part.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
In the 1970s, the Armenian radio was asked if a snake could break its spine.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
The Armenian radio thought and replied that a snake could break its spine if it crawled along the party's general line.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Sometimes the company experiences a stage of a radical break in the party's general line,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
when the leadership comes to work on Monday and says,

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
guys, everything is wrong, everything we do is wrong, it was right before, but it is not right in the future.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
We must remake our strategy, remake our business model, go another way, otherwise we will not survive.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
Imagine that you are a distributor of body care, home chemistry, cosmetics, and you are in a tight spot.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
On the one hand, the factory is pressuring you, twisting your hands at the price and payment conditions.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
On the other hand, the clients are pressing you harder, who also twist your hands at the price and payment conditions.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
In addition, the competition is getting tougher, and you understand that you cannot live like this.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
You understand that you have three options as a distributor.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Either go into production, or go into logistics, become a cool logistics operator, or create your own business.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
The second example is also about this.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The company produces lasers.

06:49.000 --> 06:59.000
Until some point, it felt good in the industry, but everything changes, competition changes, suppliers change, clients change.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
The management of the company understands that it is impossible to live as we used to live.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I drew three scenarios for myself.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.000
The first scenario is the so-called operational perfection, when the company will bet on a standard mass laser,

07:20.000 --> 07:29.000
to produce lasers in a very narrow range, focusing on the mass market, and polishing its logistics and production.

07:29.000 --> 07:39.000
At the same time, the business cannot boast of innovative ideas, it is unlikely that it can boast of an amazing service or a strong brand.

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
The second scenario is the product management, which usually involves huge investments in new-ocre, in the final development.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
Some of these investments go to waste, but some of them are likely to be successful,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and the company offers the market an absolutely innovative product, an absolutely innovative laser,

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
and can remove the cream from this product for some time.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
The third scenario is customization,

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
offering a laser to a client with very sharp edges,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
because this is what the client wants,

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
according to Feng Shui, this is correct, when the laser has round corners and yellow color,

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
as well as a specific lamp that the client wants to see.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
There are three ways to go, operational perfection, product management, or int-poshiv.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
But the company cannot go in three ways at the same time, due to the limitation of all types of resources.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
The third example is the company working on the ice cream market.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
In recent years, the ice cream market has not grown very intensively, and at the moment it is not growing at all.

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
At the same time, another direction has grown, the so-called cold logistics,

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
that is, cold transport, in which you can transport ice cream, dumplings, frozen vegetables,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
and warehouses where all this can also be stored.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
This cold logistics has grown to the same volume in terms of revenue and profit as ice cream.

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
If you do this closely, you can earn a lot, because the market is still quite raw.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
And again, the company thinks about how to live further, whether we need this ice cream,

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
or whether we should become operators in the cold logistics market.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
All these three companies, in order to make a conscious strategic choice,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
and develop a competitive strategy that is understandable for themselves and for their employees,

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
must make a so-called strategic analysis at the stage number 0.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
The logic of this strategic analysis is presented on this slide.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
In a nutshell, it consists of two main tasks,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
this is a strategic analysis of the external environment and a strategic analysis of the company itself.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
When we analyze the external environment, we usually use two tools.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
This is the analysis of the PEST factors, this is the so-called analysis of the remote environment.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
The company looks at the policy and legal factors that can influence its work in the near future.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
The company tries to understand how the economic environment will behave in which it works.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
The company tries to understand the factors of social nature.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
And the company tries to understand the factors of technological nature.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
But this is the so-called remote environment.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
In addition, there are factors of the so-called near environment,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
which are very well described in the works of Michael Porter,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
and are known as the five-force model.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
The first is the competition in the industry,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and the power of the substitutes is the clients and suppliers,

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
as well as the analysis of the entry barriers that prevent the emergence of new players in the industry.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
If we use these two tools,

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
we will get a good understanding of what is happening and will happen in our external environment.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
In addition, in order to develop a strategy,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
you need to understand your own strengths and weaknesses,

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
what is already good and what is not very good.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
For these purposes, I recommend the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
which can be done in the format of the so-called chain of value creation.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
The fourth point is, as a rule, the requirements of the owners,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
financial and non-financial,

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
can significantly affect the strategic choice and the business model

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
that the employee management is trying to implement in practice.

12:00.000 --> 12:10.000
The results of all these analyses can be summarized in the final summary document,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
which is called the SWOT analysis,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and represents a set of strengths and weaknesses,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
opportunities and threats listed on a piece of paper in the A4 format,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
in the One Page Only format.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
After that, we can assess and weigh the further paths of our own development.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
We can assess whether we will go into production, logistics, or our own retail,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
or we will go into operational improvement, product leadership, or int-poshiv.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
After weighing the alternatives, we will make our own strategic choice.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
So, the analysis of external environment factors,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
which consists of two sections,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
the analysis of the factors of the distant environment and the analysis of the factors of the near environment.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
When analyzing the factors of the distant environment,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
we can use the PEST or STEP model.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I repeat that this is an abbreviation of four English words.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
The political-legal environment is the letter P,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
the economic environment is the letter E,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
the letter S is the factors of the social environment,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and the letter T is technology.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
What do we analyze at the stage of the analysis of political-legal issues?

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
We try to understand how much the law that operates in the external environment

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
can affect our business.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
We try to predict how it will change,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
in a positive or negative direction.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
The second point is to understand how seriously the state can interfere in our business.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
The third point is to understand how great the level of corruption in the market we work in is.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
We ask ourselves questions like this

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
before developing a strategy,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
trying to understand our political-legal environment.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
A small example on this topic.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
Ukraine is a market for buildings made of fast-mounted metal structures.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
A construction company offers its customers buildings made of metal.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
It can be a logistics center, a warehouse, a production facility,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
a hypermarket, a metal box.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
In 2005, the company felt very good,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
experienced a stage of rapid growth,

14:50.000 --> 14:59.000
at the end of the year it rented a new office space with a margin,

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
and the sales plan for the next year was quite ambitious.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
But due to political reasons, the orange revolution,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
sales fell significantly next year.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Potential customers did not have less money,

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
but they were afraid to invest in logistics centers,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
hypermarkets, real estate.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
They were waiting for the government's decision

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
on what was allowed and what was not allowed in Ukraine.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
They waited for almost a year,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and only in November of the following year,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
the company sales began to grow again.

15:44.000 --> 15:54.000
We understand how political factors can affect our success.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
The letter E, the letter M, is the economy.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
We analyze inflation,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
we try to understand how the cost of capital on the market will change,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
whether capital will increase or decrease,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
we try to understand how unemployment will behave,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
what will happen in the labor market, and so on.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
The letter S is the social environment factors.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
Here we analyze the demography on the market,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
we try to understand the cultural features of some markets,

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
we can analyze the level of education on the market.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
These are the questions we discuss,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
analyzing the letter S, the social environment.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
The fourth section is the technological environment factors.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
The influence of the Internet on our business,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
the influence of new technologies in our industry,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
the influence of IT.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
These are the factors we analyze before developing a strategy.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
A small nuance.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
If a company operates in several markets,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I mean geographical markets,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
for example, it operates in the Russian market,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
in the Ukrainian market, in the Belarusian market,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
and in the Polish market.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
It may be that the letter P on these four markets

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
is quite different and affects the business in a very different way.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Again, the letter E, the economic factors,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
can be quite different on these markets

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and can also affect our business.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
The conclusion is that the company will have to pass this PEST analysis four times.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Pass the PEST analysis for the Russian market,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
for the Ukrainian, for the Belarusian, for the Polish,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
to understand all the nuances that it will have to consider

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
in the next two or three years if it wants to continue working on these markets.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
A small nuance.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
When we do a PEST analysis,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
we evaluate the positive or negative impact of all these

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
political, legal, economic, social and technological factors on our business.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
We must understand that the same factors

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
in companies from different industries can have a positive or negative effect

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
on some companies, have a neutral effect.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
For example, in Krzysztof Obloy's book

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
The Strategies of a Successful Company,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
which is recommended in the list of literature,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
there is a funny observation about how the factor on the letter S,

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
namely the formation of the YAPI class,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Young Professionals,

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
in Poland, has a very different effect on businesses from different industries.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
It is very positive for restaurants,

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
for car and car salesmen,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
that young professionals are being formed in Poland.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
But companies that produce children's goods,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
diapers, children's food,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
they are in complete sorrow,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
because YAPI children are usually started late.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And if a company makes tractors,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
then the formation of the YAPI group has no effect on it.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And another nuance.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
When we do a PEST analysis,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
we do not just list the factors that affect us.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
We must immediately ask ourselves the question,

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
what exactly a particular structural unit of our company should do,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
or, on the contrary, should not do, in response to the effect of this factor.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
In the materials, we have an example of a PEST analysis of a company that produces websites.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It is engaged in web design.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
The company is located in one of the regional centers of the Russian Federation.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
There it has a production site and a central office.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
However, the company is interested in the Moscow market,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
and it has a representative here who works with clients

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
and, analyzing the PEST factors,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
the company, for itself, by the letter S,

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
denotes a high degree of snobbery in public consciousness in Moscow.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
And we must immediately understand what this means for our business,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
for the individual structural units of our company.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
It means that the company should look like a Moscow one,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
it should have an office in Moscow,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
it should have a convincing client list,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
and sometimes for this you have to win a tender

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
to supply the site, for example, Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble for 1 euro.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
That is, the Coca-Cola company announces a tender,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
I want a site,

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
and the company we are considering won a tender for 1 euro,

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
because it needs a convincing client list to work in the Moscow market.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
So, when we analyze the PEST factors,

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
we always ask ourselves what this factor means for our company,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
how it will affect our company in the near future,

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
and what we should do and what we should not do in response to this factor.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
We have at least two examples from different industries in our materials.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
For each tool that we are considering,

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
the first task that I recommend you to do is to conduct a PEST analysis for your company.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.000
You can find the image of those mini cases, those examples that are in our materials.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
PEST analysis of the Russian market with the eyes of the company that makes the sites,

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
and the example of the PEST analysis of the Ukrainian market with the eyes of the company that works in the kitchen furniture market.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Please remember that if you have to work in several markets,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
you will most likely have to do several PEST analyses.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
For one market, PEST, and for another market, PEST.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
And please remember that you do not just list that inflation is like this,

22:24.000 --> 22:32.000
that the currency rate is like this, that unemployment is like this, and that the level of education is like this.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
You must immediately try to understand how this will affect your business in the near future,

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
and ideally, even form a so-called to-do list, a list of what needs to be done in the near future

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
in order to take into account the effect of this factor.

22:48.000 --> 23:00.000
For example, the company sells spare parts and says that in recent years there have been more traffic jams on the streets of cities,

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
and more and more often people began to buy Asian and American brands.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Such trends are on the market.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
What does this mean from the point of view of our strategy?

23:12.000 --> 23:20.000
This means that our product portfolio needs to include more spare parts for American and Asian cars.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
Given that there are many traffic jams, the clutch breaks, the gearbox breaks,

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
so the demand for these spare parts will most likely increase, and we will be able to sell more of them in the coming years.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
This is a specific conclusion for the product portfolio based on the results of the PEST analysis.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
Please, not just a list of factors, but a list of what needs to be done in the next column.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
A so-called to-do list, a list of necessary actions,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
which can be immediately recorded in a document called a strategy.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
The next tool we will look at is the analysis of the factors of the near environment.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
This analysis is carried out using the model proposed by Michael Porter.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
This model is known as the Five Force model.

24:23.000 --> 24:32.000
Michael Porter, explaining why the value of the profitability of the invested capital is average,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
in different industries, proposes the Five Force model.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
He says that the ROI, the profitability of the invested capital,

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
depends on how the Five Force configuration is formed in the industry,

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
how sharp the competition in this industry is, and how powerful the supply of spare parts is.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Spare parts are products from other industries,

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
which can bite off a piece of the pie that we and our competitors claim.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
These are not our direct competitors, these are players from other industries,

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
but they are able to pull the money of our clients.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
In principle, these are two similar forces, but Porter divides them into two parts.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
The first force is the competition, these are players in our industry.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
The second force is players from other industries,

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
which are able to influence the situation in the industry in which we work with our competitors.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
The third force is clients, with whom we trade in terms of price and payment conditions,

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
and suppliers, with whom we also trade in terms of price and payment conditions.

25:45.000 --> 25:56.000
The fourth force is the entry barriers, these are the brick walls that we ourselves or jointly build with our competitors.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
We can add barbed wire to the top, and a couple of machine tools with dogs,

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
so that new players do not come to our industry.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
If we do this, then with other equal ROI, the profit of the invested capital will be greater.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
For example, IKEA, working in the Russian market, complains in an interview to a Russian magazine

26:18.000 --> 26:27.000
that local competitors have lobbied for high customs duties, which IKEA is forced to pay for customs.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
Local Russian furniture makers lobbied for this regulatory act in their interests,

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
and, in fact, they have taken their position in the industry with a fairly high brick wall.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
If they had not done this, the profit of the invested capital, with other equal ones, would have been less.

26:46.000 --> 26:56.000
Let's try to understand how the configuration of 5 forces on the porter affects the assignment of the profitability of the invested capital in the industry.

26:56.000 --> 27:08.000
The German brewery industry, the competition in the beer market in Germany is the most severe for several centuries.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
In 1516, the so-called Reinhardt's Code was adopted in Germany,

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
according to which beer can be called a drink consisting only of water, malt and hops.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
There can be no other components in beer.

27:25.000 --> 27:35.000
If there is ascorbic acid or orange zest in beer, then this drink should be called not beer, but something else.

27:35.000 --> 27:44.000
Players in the industry work with the same set of resources, namely water, malt and hops.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Water is about the same, malt is about the same, hops are about the same.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
They need to be different from each other in at least one way or another, but in this industry this is quite difficult.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
We can say that all the niches and niches in the German brewery market are clogged for a long time.

28:02.000 --> 28:10.000
For example, in Bavaria there is the city of Bamberg, where a local player in the beer market produces the so-called Rauchbier,

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
which can probably be translated into Russian as smoked beer.

28:14.000 --> 28:21.000
This is beer that smells a little like smoke or smoked sausage.

28:21.000 --> 28:30.000
No benzoles are added to the beer, this is water, malt and hops, this is Reinhardt's Code, the law of 1516.

28:30.000 --> 28:41.000
But the technology of making this drink itself obviously involves the use of some coals through which this beer is filtered,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
and as a result it smells a little like smoked sausage.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
That is, the niches and niches are clogged, the competition is fierce.

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
In addition, players in this industry have to reconcile, not reconcile, but reckon with the actions of the substitutes.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
This can be water, ordinary water, which the Germans drink more and more.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
It can be wines from the New World, Chilean, Argentinian, not only from the New World.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
It can be weak alcohol cocktails, it can sometimes even be ice cream.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
If you look at the sales, beer and other drinks on the German market,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
you can see that beer has been declining in recent years,

29:24.000 --> 29:34.000
and the volume of water consumption, the volume of wine consumption, the volume of weak alcohol cocktails, they are growing, and quite seriously.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
The younger generation of Germans says that beer is an old-fashioned dad's drink.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
This is the drink that the dad drinks when he comes home from work.

29:43.000 --> 29:52.000
Well, for a young German, drinking an old-fashioned drink is not good, he must drink a weak alcohol cocktail.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
In other words, the power of substitutes, products from adjacent and other industries is also very high.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
The client. The client can be divided into two parts.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
These are retail networks that buy at this price and may not pay 180 days,

30:09.000 --> 30:25.000
and the end consumers, who, as we said, are not doing very well either, switching to other drinks, water, wine, and so on.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Suppliers.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
Gold is constantly rising, copper is constantly rising, electricity is constantly rising.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Suppliers of equipment also spin beer makers' hands.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
In general, almost by the entire list of suppliers, everything is quite difficult.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
In such a heavy industry, the profitability of invested capital will obviously not be very high.

30:50.000 --> 31:05.000
There are probably not so many such sad industries, but we see how Michael Porter's theory of five forces explains what money we can count on working in the retail industry.

31:05.000 --> 31:13.000
We must understand our industry, we must understand how competition will affect us in the near future,

31:13.000 --> 31:22.000
how the power of clients will change, how the power of suppliers will change, what barriers there are and what barriers there may be.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
But we should not passively observe this.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
We must try to actively influence all five forces, offer something unique to our clients,

31:31.000 --> 31:41.000
try to actively work with suppliers, try to be friends or go into niches, working with competitors.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
We must create entry barriers, create entry barriers alone or together with competitors,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
but one way or another, actively working across the entire list of five forces.

31:52.000 --> 32:03.000
So, when we analyze our industry, we try to understand how our competitors will behave in the near future,

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
whether players from other industries, replacement products, will affect the situation in our industry,

32:11.000 --> 32:21.000
how the power of clients will change, this is primarily the ability of clients to trade at a price and on payment terms,

32:21.000 --> 32:29.000
as well as the power of suppliers, again, the ability to trade with us at a price and on payment terms.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
The fifth force is the entry barriers that prevent the emergence of new players in our industry.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
Typical questions that we analyze, using this tool on competition,

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
are to understand the degree of sharpness of competitive struggle in our industry,

32:49.000 --> 32:59.000
to understand how consolidated players in our industry are, how the degree of consolidation will change in the near future.

32:59.000 --> 33:10.000
By analyzing the replacement products, we ask ourselves how much better or worse are the replacement products from other industries

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
in terms of price-quality ratio, if we compare it with the products that our industry produces.

33:17.000 --> 33:31.000
If we analyze our clients, we ask how great is the ability of our clients to bargain with us at a price and on payment terms.

33:31.000 --> 33:39.000
We can imagine ourselves as a person who arranges armwrestling with a client and asks,

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
can I win a client at a price and on payment terms, or the client wins me at a price and on payment terms.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
The same with suppliers, the same with armwrestling, the price of the purchase and the payment terms.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
As for the entry barriers, everything is reduced to money, probably,

34:03.000 --> 34:11.000
but if we do not reduce everything to money and do not analyze only the size of the investments that we need to enter the industry,

34:11.000 --> 34:21.000
we can analyze, for example, legislative barriers, we can try to understand how deep in the consumer consciousness there are myths

34:22.000 --> 34:31.000
that the products that are offered on the market by already existing players are good,

34:31.000 --> 34:41.000
and we can try to understand how difficult it is for new players to get on the shelf in a retail store.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
In general, the barriers to entry can be all kinds, in principle, everything can be reduced to money,

34:46.000 --> 34:55.000
but there are factors that play a role besides financial factors.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
A small but important point.

34:57.000 --> 35:05.000
In the 21st century, the boundaries of industries are erasing, and there are a lot of interesting businesses that are created at the junction of industries.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
Imagine, there is a company that produces sites, namely, promotional sites,

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
and, in principle, it works at the junction of two industries, the IT industry and the marketing industry.

35:17.000 --> 35:25.000
It offers the client not just a website, it offers him a tool for promoting its products on the market.

35:25.000 --> 35:38.000
There is a certain concept of promotion, there is a certain IT solution combined with ideas in the field of marketing.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
The conclusion is that a company, analyzing its industry, should, in fact, analyze two industries,

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
the analysis of 5 forces for the IT industry and the analysis of 5 forces for the marketing industry.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
There is no other way.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Another example.

35:53.000 --> 36:01.000
The Controller Academy is a structure that was created in Germany in 1971 by Albrecht Dall.

36:01.000 --> 36:10.000
It is a business built at the junction of two industries, namely, business education, in particular, controlling, and tourism.

36:11.000 --> 36:21.000
The Controller Academy offers the client a mix between new knowledge and a cool vacation in the Alps in Bavaria.

36:21.000 --> 36:30.000
It offers the client to come to them for a week, get new knowledge, get communication with colleagues from other industries,

36:31.000 --> 36:42.000
get new ideas, and also spend time in nature, a clean lake, delicious Italian food, a pleasant atmosphere.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
This is the so-called edutainment.

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
Again, the junction of two industries, in this case, business education and the recreation industry.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
Again, a company operating in this business should, in fact, analyze two industries,

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
namely, business education and recreation industry.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
The third example you see on this slide is a company that produces inter-room doors.

37:11.000 --> 37:20.000
It has a production site, and the product made in this production site is transferred to dealers

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
or to its own structures that are engaged in wholesale sales.

37:25.000 --> 37:34.000
In the end, the door goes to the retail market, and the company dreams of its own retail market, but so far it does not have one.

37:34.000 --> 37:46.000
It has several production sites, and it has several wholesale structures that can buy on their own production sites, but can also buy from competitors.

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
In principle, again, analysis of two industries is necessary, analysis of 5 forces for the production part of the company,

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
because wholesale structures are the clients for the production part of the company.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
And the second analysis is necessary for players in the wholesale market,

38:03.000 --> 38:13.000
because the client for them is already the retailer, and the end customer who buys an inter-room door,

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
the supplier is not a wood supplier for the production part of the company,

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
but a production structure that makes a ready-made inter-room door.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
And again, analysis of 5 forces for two industries is necessary.

38:26.000 --> 38:35.000
The next nuance. When we analyze competition, as a rule, we have to divide competitors into so-called strategic groups.

38:36.000 --> 38:44.000
A strategic group is a group of players of the same industry, which are similar to each other by some criteria.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
For example, if we analyze the industry in which sites are made, we can divide the players in the industry into more or less homogeneous groups,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
drawing a simple matrix in which there are two variables.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
One variable will be the creativity of the sites, that is, how creative the site is.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
It can be highly creative, medium-creative, or low-creative.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
And the second variable is the so-called technological ability of the site.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
What the site can do, what opportunities are embedded in it.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
The technological ability of the site can be high, medium, or low.

39:18.000 --> 39:29.000
On the one hand, there are students of the second or third year in this industry who can make a site for their friends or not necessarily friends.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
This site will usually not be very creative and not very technological.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
It can cost two bottles of beer. But this is also a site.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
On the other hand, sites can be offered in this industry that are simultaneously super creative and super technological.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Such a site can cost 90 thousand euros.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
On this slide you see four strategic groups.

39:56.000 --> 40:07.000
There is a group of players in the gray industry, which offers super creative sites, but they are average in terms of technology.

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
There is a leader, a larger circle, and smaller players are rummaging around it.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
These are small gray circles.

40:17.000 --> 40:24.000
If you look at the orange group, this is a group of players who offer super technological sites.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
And the sites can do a lot, but the creativity of these sites can be quite average.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
There is also a large orange circle, and small players, whose sales volume is slightly smaller.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
But they also work in this strategic group.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
The upper right field is empty.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
Not because no one knows how to make super creative and super technological sites.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
The demand for such sites is very small.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
Sometimes orders are made, but they are rare.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
There is a group of students who can make a site for a bottle of beer or two.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
These are blue players.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
The lower left square.

41:09.000 --> 41:19.000
And, for example, there is a strategic group of players in green, who offer medium-sized sites in terms of technology and medium-sized sites in terms of creativity.

41:19.000 --> 41:27.000
It is impossible to say that orange players are direct competitors for blue or blue players.

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
The price of the question is fundamentally different.

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
A site for orange players or for gray players can cost several tens of thousands of euros.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
And a site for blue players can cost several tens of euros.

41:46.000 --> 41:56.000
And a very important point when we draw this table, this matrix, is the analysis of the so-called migration barriers.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
If a player works in a green strategic group, he is tired of it.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Or he is not interested in it.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Or he thinks that he will not earn much money in this strategic group.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
He wants to migrate to another strategic group.

42:13.000 --> 42:21.000
For example, he must overcome the so-called mobility or migration barriers in the orange or gray group.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
It can be new staff, new equipment, investment in marketing, and so on.

42:27.000 --> 42:37.000
But in order for a company from one strategic group to move to another, it has to move up, down, left, right along this matrix.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
And as a rule, you have to overcome the so-called mobility barriers.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And this is a very important point.

42:43.000 --> 42:50.000
We must understand what mobility barriers we will have to overcome if we want to move from one strategic group to another.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
The second example is the kitchen furniture industry.

42:55.000 --> 43:03.000
A company, analyzing its strategic groups, uses the price as one variable.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
How much does the kitchen cost?

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
The industry is divided into three parts.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
There are three layers.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
This is the economy class, the comfort class, and the premium class.

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
The economy class is 1,500 euros for the kitchen.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
From 1,500 to 5,000 euros for the kitchen is the comfort class.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
And everything from 5,000 euros and above to infinity is the premium class.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
This is the vertical class.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
What can be done in the horizontal class?

43:38.000 --> 43:45.000
In the horizontal class, you can try to analyze yourself and your competitors in terms of the quality of the furniture offered,

43:45.000 --> 43:55.000
in terms of its functionality, in terms of design, in terms of service support, in terms of manufacturing times.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
The next variable is whether we offer the kitchen to the client on credit or not.

44:03.000 --> 44:11.000
Another variable that we discuss with our competitors is the number of salons.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Some have more salons, some have fewer.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
And the last variable is the recognition.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And this is what happens.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
If you use all these variables, you can make four matrices.

44:31.000 --> 44:42.000
A company called Capri is trying to understand its place in the industry.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
How is it with quality and functionality compared to competitors?

44:47.000 --> 44:54.000
How is it with terms and with the ability to sell on credit compared to the main competitors?

44:54.000 --> 45:00.000
How does it look against the background of competitors in terms of furniture design and service support?

45:00.000 --> 45:09.000
And how does it look compared to competitors in terms of design and the width of the company's network of salons?

45:10.000 --> 45:21.000
If we do it in the format of one page only, we get a fairly clear picture of our own position in the industry compared to our competitors.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
A very useful tool is the analysis of strategic groups.

45:26.000 --> 45:36.000
It is used when we analyze our own competitors and try to understand our own place in our industry.

45:37.000 --> 45:45.000
When we analyze our competitors, we should ask ourselves the following questions.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the main players?

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
What does our competitors do better than us?

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
What does our competitors do worse than us?

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
As we look into the future, we should try to predict how the players in our industry will behave in the near future.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
What are their strategies? What will they do? What will they not do?

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
And how will their behavior in the next two or three years affect the situation in the industry?

46:16.000 --> 46:23.000
The third question we can ask ourselves is how great is the ability of players to negotiate with each other.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
Can we be friends? Can we share our influence?

46:27.000 --> 46:36.000
If we can, how high is the probability that our competitors will comply with the agreements and not violate them?

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
This is how we try to understand our competitors.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
The second strength that Porter considers important is the power of the substitutes.

46:47.000 --> 46:55.000
I repeat that these are players from other industries, but they are able to withdraw money from our industry.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
There are industries where there are not many substitutes, or there are none.

47:01.000 --> 47:10.000
But if a company produces glass, it is very difficult to say that there is a serious substitute.

47:10.000 --> 47:18.000
You can use plastic instead of glass, but there is no clear substitute for glass.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Or a website for a company.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
It is clear that no one had websites before, and companies were somehow similar, but now everyone has websites.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
It is unlikely that there is a clear substitute for a website.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
But there are industries where you have to make up with the actions of a large number of substitutes.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Remember the German brewery.

47:44.000 --> 47:56.000
Or if your company works in the pharmaceutical market, offering a cold medicine to a client,

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
it can face a problem.

48:00.000 --> 48:10.000
My good Czech friend says that the Czech Republic is traditionally saved from a cold with a beer in a pot.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
And they do not buy Fervex, Coldrex or other drugs.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Here is a substitute for you.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
This is something from another industry that is able to withdraw money from ours.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
The third strength is the client.

48:26.000 --> 48:36.000
When we analyze clients, we try to understand how clients can trade with us at a price and payment.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
The first thing we have to do is segment the clients.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
We have to form more or less popular segments.

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
These are groups of clients that are similar in a certain set of characteristics.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
And then we have to assess the strength of each segment.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
Because talking about clients in general is not about anything.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
It is too general, not specific and useless.

49:05.000 --> 49:13.000
Therefore, the conclusion is that the number 0 stage is segmentation of clients for the subsequent analysis of each segment.

49:13.000 --> 49:26.000
This slide is an example of an attempt to segment the client market in the industry that produces and sells shoes.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
There are 8 criteria for segmentation.

49:30.000 --> 49:41.000
Income level, floor, age, shoe size, geography of residence, city size, occupation type and attitude to fashion or style.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
These are the 8 criteria for segmentation.

49:44.000 --> 49:54.000
A company that produces shoes and has its own shoe store network considers important in its business.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Let's look at the income level.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
There is a group of clients that earn up to 300 euros per month.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
There is a group of clients that earn 300-500 euros per month.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Next, 500-700.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
The fourth group is in the range of 700-1000 euros per month.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Another segment is from 1000 to 2000.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
And the last segment is clients that can earn from 2000 euros per month.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
So, in a large cell, we divided the income level of clients into 6 groups.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
I repeat, the shoe industry.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
The second criteria for segmentation is floor.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It's simple.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
The third criteria is age.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
The company made its clients in 6 age categories.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Up to 16 years.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
16-21 years.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
21-30.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
30-45.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
45-60.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
And from 60 years.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
The sizes.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
The sizes of the shoes.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Up to 35.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
36-37.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
38-39.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
40-41.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
42-43.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
And 44 and above.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
The company operates on 3 geographic markets.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Each market has its own nuances.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
There are nuances of the Ukrainian market, nuances of the Baltic market, nuances of the Russian market.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Let's recall PEST.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
Politics, economy, social technology.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
All these 4 letters can be distinguished on these 3 markets.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Ukrainian, Baltic and Russian.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
The company operates in different cities.

51:34.000 --> 51:40.000
There are no stores yet, but there may be stores in cities with up to 20,000 inhabitants.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Again, there are no stores yet, but this is an interesting segment.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Cities with up to 20-50,000 inhabitants.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Next segment is 50-100,000 inhabitants.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
The next segment is 100-1,500.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
From 500,000 to a million-city is another segment.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
And the last segment is a city with a million-city and above.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
The type of occupation of the client is divided into a large number of groups.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
We see only 4 groups on this slide.

52:12.000 --> 52:23.000
For example, a student, an office manager of a middle level, an office manager of a high level, a head of a workshop, etc.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
The company makes its clients into 3 groups.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
Interested, moderate and indifferent.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
Let's look at 2 target segments.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
Let's try to understand how the company should work with these segments.

52:43.000 --> 52:49.000
The next slide shows a grey segment.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
This is a man who earns 2,000 euros.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
He is 55 years old.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
He is 43 years old.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
He lives in Russia.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
The population of the city is 750,000.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
He works as a head of a workshop in one of the businesses.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
He has a rather indifferent attitude to fashion.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
This is his portrait.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
This is a portrait of a second client.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
This is a woman who earns 620 euros per month.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
She is 24 years old.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
She is 37 years old.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
She lives in Ukraine, in a million-city, Kiev.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
She works as an office manager of a middle level.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
She has an attitude to fashion.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
These are 2 very different clients.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
If a company wants to work with grey and yellow,

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
it should understand the portrait of each client.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It is very simple.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
The better we understand our client, the more we earn.

54:02.000 --> 54:09.000
If we can draw a portrait of our grey client in the smallest details,

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
there is a high probability that we will earn a lot.

54:15.000 --> 54:22.000
If a company is oriented to the yellow and grey segments,

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
its entire chain of processes,

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
from the design, to the purchase, to the production,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
to the branding, to the distribution, to the retail,

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
can be very different.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
One chain of processes will be focused on the yellow segment,

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
and the other chain of processes will be focused on the grey segment.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
We should understand this very well.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
When we analyze our clients,

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
the list of questions can be as follows.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
First of all, as we have already said,

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
we try to assess the profitability of our target segments.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
How much the yellow or grey segments,

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
or any other segment that interests us,

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
can trade with us in terms of price and payment conditions,

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
and how it will be able to change in the near future.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
What is our current situation, and what will it be in 2-3 years?

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
The second question is the volume of purchases.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
How much and how often does one segment buy,

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
and how much and how often does the other segment buy?

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
It may be that your business has a segment that buys a little bit, but often,

55:34.000 --> 55:40.000
or maybe you have a segment that buys a lot, but very rarely.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
The client's portrait changes.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
It is one now, tomorrow it will be another.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
We should understand how the needs of the target segments,

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
which we are focused on in our business, will change in the near future.

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
The next factor, which can be very important in some industries,

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
is the cost of switching from one provider to another,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
and the level of loyalty.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
What do I mean by this?

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
If we are talking about household chemicals,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
for example, washing powder,

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
then in this industry the cost of switching from one player to another is usually not very high.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Today I am using one washing powder,

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
tomorrow I will not like it, I will switch it to another,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
and it is not difficult for me.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
However, if we are talking about software for business,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
some IT solution,

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
then switching from one provider to another is like a marriage-divorce process.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
It is quite difficult, painful and expensive.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
If the costs of switching from one provider to another are high,

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
then the client's power will be higher.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Another factor that we can analyze,

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
is the share of costs of buying the product we offer in the cost structure.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
For example, if we offer the end product to the client,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
and the client is a metallurgical plant,

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
then the share of costs of buying the product will be low,

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
and the price sensitivity will be low.

57:15.000 --> 57:22.000
If we offer the end product to a metallurgical plant at a high price,

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
the client will not feel it,

57:26.000 --> 57:33.000
because the share of the total purchases in the structure is negligible.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
Another point that we should analyze,

57:38.000 --> 57:44.000
is the possibility of integration forward or backward along the chain.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
What do I mean?

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Let's imagine an oil refinery,

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
which can rewind the chain of its processes.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
What does it mean?

57:56.000 --> 58:03.000
It means that it can try to put drilling towers in the oil production area,

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
or extend the chain forward,

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
or make its own network of gas stations.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
If we have the opportunity to extend the chain forward,

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
we are an oil refinery,

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
and we can easily put our own gas stations,

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
then our position in negotiations on the price of the gas network is stronger.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Another factor is the seasonality.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So, the conclusion is as follows.

58:34.000 --> 58:43.000
We segment our clients in order to understand the needs and behavior of each of the segments that interest us,

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
and to work with each of them in different ways.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
It is obvious that the work of a company with a target segment of a woman of pre-retirement age,

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
who works as a chief accountant of a large machine-building enterprise,

58:57.000 --> 59:03.000
and who values agility and comfort in shoes,

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
should work with one method, and with another target segment.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
A young woman of 25 years,

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
who prefers brightness, style and uniqueness in shoes,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
with this target segment of the company,

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
in all parts of the chain of its own processes,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
should work differently.

59:25.000 --> 59:32.000
It is very important to understand how the portrait of your client will change in the near future,

59:32.000 --> 59:42.000
and to be prepared for the fact that the chain of processes will have to be redone and sharpened to meet the needs of each segment.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
The second example on the same topic is from another industry,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
the production of kitchen furniture.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
The company that we have already talked about,

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
divides its clients into four segments in terms of payment capabilities,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
highlighting low incomes, medium, medium-high and high,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
as well as into four parts in terms of proven values.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The example of this matrix, the example of segmentation of clients,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
is described in detail in this business in your materials.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Having discussed our clients,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and analyzed the target segments,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
and chosen the most interesting for ourselves,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
we should think about how to take these chests with money at the lowest possible costs for resources.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
In this case, we need to analyze the suppliers.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It is very useful to imagine the reports of profits and losses,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
in which on the one hand there are incomes, and on the other there are expenses.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
When we analyze the clients, we try to find those interesting segments

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
from which we could take more money,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and sharpen our chain of processes accordingly.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
When we analyze our suppliers, we are talking about our expenses.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Here we should analyze all the articles of our costs.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It can be raw materials, it can be electricity, it can be equipment suppliers,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
it can be suppliers of square meters of heating and lighting,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it can be suppliers of all kinds of services, transport, information, insurance, and so on.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It can be channels of communication with clients.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
If we decide that advertising time on TV is very expensive,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
we can try to reach out to the client via the Internet,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
or through external advertising, or some other means.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:55.000
A very important supplier is the staff that supplies us with their heads and hands,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
which we use in our business and for which we pay some money.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And, of course, a very important supplier is the supplier of capital.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It can be banks, it can be other structures that can give us money for development,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and the money is not free, it costs a certain percentage.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
One way or another, we have to go through the entire list of our expenses,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
evaluating the ability of suppliers to trade with us at the price and on the terms of payment.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The main questions when analyzing suppliers are as follows.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
First of all, again, it is the ability to trade at the price and on the terms of payment.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
The second question is readiness for the stability of deliveries,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
both the quality parameters and the time parameters.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Is the supplier we work with able to provide us with the level of quality we would like to have

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and to supply our product or service that is stated in the contract?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The third question we can ask ourselves is whether there are substitutes for the product that the supplier supplies us with.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
If there are, then the position of the supplier in negotiations changes, the power of the supplier decreases.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The same thing happens if we have an alternative for each type of resource,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
if we can turn to a large enough list of suppliers.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
For example, if we open the yellow page of the reference book,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and for each type of resource we need in our industry there are 384 tomato suppliers,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and all the tomato suppliers have the same number of suppliers,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
then the power of the tomato suppliers over us will be small.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
In some industries, a fairly important factor may be the distance of the suppliers,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
as well as the ability to integrate back and forth.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
If our supplier can easily extend the chain forward,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
become our direct competitor, then his position in negotiations is stronger.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And vice versa, if we can easily unwind the chain and tell the supplier

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that we are able to make the parts that you supply us,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
then it is very easy for us.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Accordingly, our position in negotiations becomes stronger.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The second task that I recommend you to do is to analyze the factors of the environment,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
try to understand your industry through the FiveForce model, the five forces of Michael Porter.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Everyone has competition, everyone has clients and suppliers,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and there are entry barriers in any industry.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Is there a substitute product factor in your business?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I don't know, because there are companies for which there is no problem with a substitute product,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
but there are industries where there are a lot of substitute products from other industries.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000
There is a point of view that Porter did not take into account all the factors in the industry within his FiveForce concept.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
For example, some experts suggest adding the sixth force of the state,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
but in principle, the state factor can be spread over all the five forces,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
because the state can be a competitor, a supplier, a client,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.000
an entry barrier, like a writer of some regulatory acts or a customs officer.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But in principle, we discussed the state factor when we were submitting the PEST analysis.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The letter P, the letter P, the legal issues, we discussed them.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But it seems to me that everything is quite consistent and logical in the FiveForce concept.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Please remember that you are not just listing factors,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
you are again, as with the PEST analysis, trying to understand what this means for your business,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
what is included in the list of actions, what is included in the to-do list.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If the client's demand increases and the clients will be divided into more or less homogeneous groups,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
each of which will have its own specific needs, requests, and so on,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
then you will most likely need to develop a certain service model for each target group,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:22.000
develop a standard, train the staff and control the implementation of this standard.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
This is a fairly specific action that we record in our strategy, analyzing our clients.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And please remember that if your business operates at the junction of industries,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
IT, marketing, business education, the recreation industry,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you will have to do this work twice, do the analysis of the FiveForce for both industries,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
to take into account all the factors that you need to track when developing your strategy.
