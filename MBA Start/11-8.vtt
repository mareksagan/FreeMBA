00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The topic of today's lecture is the control and assessment of the effectiveness of marketing activity.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
This lecture consists of three sections.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
In the first section, we will consider the problem of measuring the effectiveness of marketing as such.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
We will look at the main model, which is at the heart of the entire assessment of the effectiveness of marketing.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
This model is called the chain model of effectiveness.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
In the second section, we will consider the main marketing metrics.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
This is a tool for measuring the various aspects of the marketing activity of a company,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
which is later used for control.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
We will consider the control of marketing activity in the third section.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Now let's see what are the goals and tasks of our lecture today.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
First of all, in order to start studying the control and assessment of marketing activity,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
it is necessary to understand why this control is needed.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Because many companies believe that there is no need for this.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
We will provide arguments in favor of the fact that control is necessary for every company.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And every company must study the results of its investment in marketing

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
and control them on a regular basis.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Then we will study the main marketing metrics.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I have completed quite a lot of practical tasks.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
And by the end of the second section,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
you all should learn to calculate the main quantitative indicators in marketing on your own,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
to use them in your companies to measure the effectiveness of marketing activity.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
After that, we will consider the main principles of marketing control.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
We will see how the marketing metrics we have studied

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
are used for complex control of the marketing activity of companies

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
and assessment of the results of the activity.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We will proceed to the first part, to the execution of our first task,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
to show that the control and assessment of the effectiveness of marketing activity are really necessary for companies.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Many companies in practice believe that such an activity as control is not necessary.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It is just a waste of money,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
the time of employees and no tangible effect this activity gives.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Many companies really neglect control.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And, it would seem, they live quite happily.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But this is just the situation that is said to be happiness in ignorance.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Recently, a study was conducted by several American companies,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
as a result of which they found that for every dollar invested in marketing,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
they get a profit of only 70 cents.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
They were horrified to find that all those huge investments in marketing that they made

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
actually brought losses to companies.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
They could live in ignorance and on,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
but now they understand that their marketing activity is ineffective

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
and they should correct their actions.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
And think about whether your marketing is actually effective or not.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Do you get a profit from those investments that you invest in advertising

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
or other aspects of promoting your product or in the development of new products?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Therefore, every company must use control

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
of the results of its marketing activity on a regular basis

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
and find out the problems that arise in due time.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
The problem of neglect of the control of the marketing activity

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
is typical for both foreign and Russian companies.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Among the foreign managers, a survey was conducted, which gave the following results.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
66% of managers said that the control of the assessment of the effectiveness of marketing

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
is the most relevant problem for them today.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
The problem is not only that the marketing budgets of many companies

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
are millions of dollars and they are second in many cases after the production costs.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
The problem is that, unfortunately, many marketing specialists

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
still do not have the qualifications to fully assess the effectiveness of marketing.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
As for Russian companies,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
many directors of Russian enterprises often say

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
that Russian marketers often neglect the control of the effectiveness of their marketing activities

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
and cannot assess whether the marketing decisions they make are reasonable.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
At a recent conference on the problems of teaching marketing in Russia,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
the director of the marketing company Fort Motor Company stated

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
that her company also has a problem of assessing the effectiveness of marketing.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It is related to the following.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Russian marketers can develop the most creative advertising campaigns,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
can offer great ideas, but they do not think about

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
whether it is reasonable to implement these ideas in terms of profit for the company.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
They just do not know how to assess the effectiveness of marketing decisions.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
This is a really relevant problem for both Russia and foreign companies.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
If we recall the marketing mix and the 4P or 5-7P that we considered in the general marketing module,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
we need to add the following.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
The most important P in marketing is profitability.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And every company should understand that marketing is not the goal itself,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
it is a tool for increasing the company's profits and improving the results of its activities.

05:40.000 --> 05:51.000
Now, after we are sure that the control of marketing activities is really necessary for any company,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
we will move on to the first section of our lectures

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
and consider what place control takes in terms of marketing.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Pay attention to the slide.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
You see that any marketing plan starts with control and ends with control.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
At the beginning, the company sets a summary of the control indicators of its activity,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
which it will use at the end of the marketing plan to implement control.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Have the goals that were set by the company at the beginning been achieved?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Do the real results correspond to the desired results?

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Thus, control is an integral part of the marketing activity of any company.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's consider the model of the chain of marketing effectiveness.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
The essence of this model is as follows.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Each company has its own strategy.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
There is a set of functional strategies that you have already studied.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
But the implementation of any strategy involves certain tactical actions of the company.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
In the slide, you can see how the strategy block is being used to implement the tactical actions of the company.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
It is easy to assume that any tactical actions,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
be it the implementation of an advertising campaign or the development of a new product,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
involve certain costs.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
By investing money in these tactical actions,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
the company assumes that it will get a significant result.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Namely, the increase in profits, for example,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
or the change in other indicators of the company's activity.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
What actions can take place?

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
In the slide, you can see that tactical actions can affect the internal and external environment of the company in a certain way.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
First, they influence the buyers.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
For example, they change their attitude to the product or change the behavior of the buyer.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Secondly, these actions influence the market.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Thirdly, they influence the financial indicators of the company's activity.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
For example, the level of profit the company receives.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
When the company invests money in certain tactical actions,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
the company assumes that it will get certain results.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
The results can be as follows.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
In the right part of the slide, you can see a list of possible results.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
On the one hand, they can reflect the change in the company's position in the market.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
For example, the share of the company's market can increase.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Secondly, these actions can increase the company's market capital

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
and increase the value of the company's relationship with the consumers.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And finally, the company's profit or share price can change.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
Here we can see that on one side of the scale there are the company's costs for the tactical actions,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the conditioned strategies,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
and on the other side there is the result expressed in the aspects related to the finances,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
the market and the consumers.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
If we compare what we have invested and what we have received,

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
we can evaluate how effective our marketing activity is.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Any company has an idea of the size of its marketing budget.

09:14.000 --> 09:22.000
But how can we evaluate the results related to the consumers, the market and the financial indicators?

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
In order to quantify the aspects related to the consumers, the market and the financial indicators of the company's activities,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
there are so-called marketing metrics.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
What are marketing metrics?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Metrics are a system of quantitative indicators that can be used in any discipline.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Marketing also has its own set of metrics.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
It is the marketing metrics that allow us to quantify the aspects related to the consumers,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
the market and the financial indicators of the company's activities.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
If we could not quantify the results of our marketing activities,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
we would not be able to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of our marketing.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Pay attention to the slide.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Here you can see the classification of marketing metrics.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
All marketing metrics can be divided into several groups.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
In the center you can see the most important marketing metrics,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
those related to the market and our consumers.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
In addition, each marketing activity has its own metrics.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Sales management has its own metrics.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Advertising management also has its own marketing metrics.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Today we will look at all these quantitative indicators in order to learn how to calculate them.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's start with the metrics related to the market.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
The first and probably the most frequently used metric, which is known to almost everyone, is the market share.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
It would seem that it is not difficult to measure the share of the company's market.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
You just need to evaluate the volume of our product sales

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
by the volume of our product sales plus the volume of the competitors' products.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
But there are some tricky things.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
First, we need to understand what we mean by the market in this case.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Where are the boundaries of the total volume of product sales?

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
What do we mean by the products and who should we consider as competitors?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
How to correctly define the boundaries of the market?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Pay attention to the slide.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Here is an example of a certain market.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
The key words are as follows.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
The market is a sports shoe.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
We are talking about the product we are considering.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
We are not just considering the whole shoe, but the sports shoe.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The shoes for children from 2 to 16 years old.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
We limit our market to children's shoes.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
The next important aspect is the shoes for middle and high income buyers.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Again, we define the boundaries of our market

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
to better define who are our competitors.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
The next factor is geographical.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
We define the region of interest to the market.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
It is impossible to define the market share by defining the region.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Having defined the boundaries of the market,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
we need to decide how to measure the market share.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
We can measure the market share from the point of view of the volume of sales in the monetary expression.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
We can also measure the market share from the point of view of the volume of sales in the natural expression,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
that is, in the units of the product.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Which option to choose?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
What is better?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Is it better to evaluate the market share in terms of the monetary units

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
than in the natural expression or vice versa?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
In different situations, we need different assessments.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
What are the advantages and disadvantages?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Let's consider.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
If we consider the market share, taking into account the volume of sales in the monetary expression,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
then the change in the market share can be caused by, for example,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
such a factor as the change in the price of the product.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Here we cannot understand how the number of transactions with our products or with the products of competitors has changed.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Using the market share calculated from the volume of sales in the natural expression,

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
we can clearly understand that here we have taken into account only specific transactions and specific purchased goods.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Here, the price increase or, on the contrary, the price decrease does not play any role.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Now the next metric.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
The relative market share.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
What is the difference between the relative market share and the relative market share?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
When we consider the relative market share,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
we consider the volume of sales of not all the goods on our market,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
but only the volume of sales of our main competitor, if there is such a thing.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Knowing the relative market share, we can understand

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
how effective our activity is compared to the activity of our competitor.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Accordingly, if the relative market share is more than 100%,

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
it means that our volume of sales exceeds the volume of sales of the competitor.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
If it is less than 100%, then we lag behind and it is necessary to take any action.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Pay attention to the next slide.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Here you see the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Here all the goods of the company are divided into some categories.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
As you can see, they are divided according to the criteria of the market potential and the relative market share.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
These are the indicators that we have just considered.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
The next metric that needs to be studied is the market concentration index.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Different markets have different concentrations.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
In some markets there are many small players,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
in other markets there are large companies.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
For each company it is necessary to understand the market it operates in,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
what is the concentration on it.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
To calculate the concentration index,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
we need to add up the market share of several players.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Usually, it is 3 or 4 companies.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
These are companies with the largest market share.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Now let's discuss the answer.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
In our task, the concentration index of the market is 55%.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
This is not a very high indicator, but not very low.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
This means that there are several fairly serious players in the market,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and the company must take this into account in its activities.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
The next metric related to the market is the brand development index.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
How do we calculate the brand development index?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
We take the sales volume of our brand to the consumers of a certain group.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
For example, we choose a group of consumers, state institutions,

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
and calculate the brand development index in this category of consumers, in this segment.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
To do this, we divide the sales volume of our goods to this group of buyers

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
into the total sales volume of our brand.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
What does the brand development index tell us about a certain segment of buyers?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
By comparing the brand development index in different segments of buyers,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
we can understand which of these segments is stronger or weaker.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
What does it mean?

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Which segment consumes our goods or services to a greater extent, and which to a lesser extent?

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
The correct answer to this problem is the brand development index

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
in the state institution segment is 1.32.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
What does this mean?

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
If we assume that the average segment among all the segments of our consumers

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
has a development index of 1,

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
then this segment of the state institution consumes our goods more actively.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
This is one of the main segments.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
If a company has a segment of consumers with the highest brand development index,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
it means that these are the main consumers of the company,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and they should be given maximum attention.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
In some cases, knowing the brand development index in different segments,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
companies become niche.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
They switch all their efforts to this particular segment and work only with this segment.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
All other segments are secondary for them.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
This is one of the possible strategies of a company.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
The next metric is related to the market.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It is the coefficient of the brand penetration into the market.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
This metric is calculated as follows.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
We take the number of buyers who buy our goods

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
and divide it by the total number of potential buyers in the market.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
Thus, we can understand how actively our goods are used.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
The correct answer to this problem is

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
that the coefficient of the brand penetration into the market is 2.5%.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
This is a small number.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
It means that only 2.5% of potential buyers buy our goods.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
In this case, a company should either increase the awareness of its buyers,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
or change their attitude to our goods,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
that is, to cover more and more buyers.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
There are cases when the coefficient of the brand penetration into the market is very high,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
and it is close to 100%.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
What should a company do in this situation to increase the volume of sales?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
In this case, there is no one else to attract.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
All buyers or almost everyone buys our goods.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
In this case, a company should choose another strategy.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
It is possible to encourage buyers to buy our goods more often

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
or to buy our goods in a larger volume.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
Thus, we see that a company needs to know the coefficient of the brand penetration into the market

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
or a certain product into the market

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
to understand what actions to take to improve the performance of its activities.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
The next metric related to the market is called a share of the wallet.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
What does it mean?

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Imagine a buyer who goes to the store every day and buys goods of a certain category.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Let's choose a certain product category.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Let's say it's dairy products.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Our buyer buys dairy products of various brands.

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
If we take all the total costs of the buyer for dairy products in the denominator,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
and there will be costs for dairy products of our brand,

20:22.000 --> 20:34.000
we will calculate the cost of all the brands of this buyer.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
If the share of the wallet is high, the buyer buys goods of our brand only.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Maybe he rarely buys goods of other brands.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I mean goods of a certain category.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
In this case, what can we do?

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
We can only encourage him to buy goods in a larger volume.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
We have no reason to lure this buyer to competitors,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
because he does not buy goods of competitors.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
If the share of the wallet is not high,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
it means that the buyer buys both our goods of this category

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and goods of competitors.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
In this case, our primary task is to switch the buyer

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
from buying goods of competitors to buying goods of our brand.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
We see that depending on the value of the share of the wallet,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
we can take various actions to improve the performance of our activity.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Now, having considered the main metrics related to the market,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
we move on to metrics related to consumers.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
On the slide, you can see the so-called hierarchy of effects.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
The chain of awareness, attitude, behavior.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
This is a chain that the buyer needs to go through to make a purchase.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Why do we need to consider this chain?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It would seem that if we are interested in a deal,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
if we are interested in buying goods,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
why do we need to consider awareness and attitude?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
There are very serious arguments here.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
If a situation arises when the volume of sales is not high or not high enough,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
because any company's sales volume is not always high enough,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
and you always want more,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
then you need to understand the reason why the buyer refuses to buy our goods.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
The reasons can be different.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
These reasons can be identified by analyzing the behavior of the buyer at different stages.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Let's say, the buyer may not buy our goods,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
because he does not know about the existence of our brand.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
That is, awareness of our product is low.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Here we need to take certain actions,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
for example, increase our advertising budget.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
There are situations when the buyer refuses to buy for other reasons.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
When the awareness is high,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
but the attitude of the buyer to the product is not good enough,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and therefore the buyer refuses to buy.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Knowing that the problem is in the attitude,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
we will adopt completely different strategies

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
than in the case when we know that the problem is in awareness.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
If we talk about measuring awareness,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
we need to understand that this is a metric,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
which means that we measure awareness quantitatively.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
How to measure awareness quantitatively?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
First of all, you need to identify several types of awareness.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Spontaneous awareness means that

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
when the question is asked about the goods of a certain category,

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
the buyer without a hint calls our brand or the name of our company.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
And the next type of awareness is allocated,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
the so-called Top of Mind indicator.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
What does it mean?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
This indicator can be translated as the first in the list,

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
or what comes to mind first.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Here the survey is conducted as follows.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
When the question is asked,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
what brands of goods of a certain category do you know?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
And the brand that he calls first,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
or the brand that he calls first,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
is called Top of Mind.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This indicator reflects the percentage of buyers

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
who named our brand or the name of our company

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
as the first in the list of brands or goods of a certain category.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
How to measure the quantitatively?

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
This is the percentage of buyers who named our brand or the name of our company

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
without a hint.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Not necessarily the first in the list.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And how to measure the quantitatively?

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
In this case, when the buyer receives a list of companies

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
and marks the brands that he knows,

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
we record the percentage of buyers who know our product

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
based on the list they have.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Next.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
The most difficult thing is to measure the quantitatively.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
It would seem paradoxical.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
How to measure the quantitatively?

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Here, the marketers have found a solution.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Of course, the quantitatively is measured

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
by conducting a marketing survey of the buyers.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
To measure the quantitatively, it is not enough to measure it in general.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Because there is no clear understanding of what the quantitatively is.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
One buyer will say that he has a good relationship,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
another will say that it is not good enough.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
But this information will not give us anything.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We will not be able to understand the essence of the relationship

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
between our buyer and our brand or our product.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Therefore, the marketers have divided the concept of the relationship

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
into several characteristics.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
The first is the image.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
How to measure the quantitatively?

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
In the survey, the buyers are offered to evaluate a number of statements on a scale.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Usually, this scale is 5 or 7.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
1 means that the buyer does not agree with the statement at all.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
5 or 7 means that the buyer absolutely agrees with the statement.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
What statements can be given about the image?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
For example, the statement is given.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
I believe that the image of this brand corresponds to my way of life.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
Or, for example, I believe that the image of this brand suggests

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
that these products are purchased by people of mature age.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
And the buyer evaluates whether he agrees with this or not.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
And having quantitative assessments of the agreement or disagreement

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
with this statement of potential buyers,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
we can draw a conclusion about what, in the opinion of consumers,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
the image of our product is.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
The next aspect of the relationship is the price-quality ratio.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Companies and consumers may have completely different opinions

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
about the price-quality ratio.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Almost all companies believe that they have adequate prices

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
and very high quality.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
But the buyers may disagree with this for various reasons.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Because they do not know enough about the quality of the goods.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Because they have a biased opinion.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Or, in general, the attitude to the product does not allow them

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
to say that the product has high quality.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
That is, some external factors affect their opinion.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
Nevertheless, we need to evaluate how the buyers perceive

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
the price-quality ratio.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
And this perception is always subjective.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
How to do this?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
How to get quantitative assessments?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
In this case, again, there are surveys of potential buyers.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
They are offered the same 5 or 7-point scale

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
from completely disagreeable to completely agreeable.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But here such statements are offered.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
One of the most common statements used in this case

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
is that the goods of a given brand have an adequate price-quality ratio.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
And here our buyer will either agree with this or disagree.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
Another option is to say that the goods of a given brand

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
have a higher quality than the corresponding price.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
The next aspect of the quantitative attitude is the perceived quality.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
Here, too, the buyer is offered a scale from completely low quality

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
to extremely high quality.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And we get quantitative assessments of the perceived quality of our product.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Many companies are surprised when they find out

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
that the perceived quality of their goods or services

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
is significantly different from the perceived quality of their products.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Often, the buyer does not have enough information about the quality.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Therefore, it is important to measure the perceived quality,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
not the real one, whatever it is.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
The next indicator that is measured

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
during the study of the buyer's attitude to goods or brands

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
is the intention.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Here, the most various intentions are studied,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
that is, the characteristics of the behavior of the buyer.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
And also, a scale is used from completely disagreeable to completely agreeable

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
to assess various statements.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Here, the statements are associated with the actions

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
that the buyer intends or does not intend to make.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
These can be completely different statements.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
For example, I plan to refuse to purchase a product of your brand.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Here, the buyer assesses whether he agrees with this statement,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
that he plans to refuse or does not agree, that he does not plan to.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
There can be more complex statements.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
For example, if I find that there is no product available in the store

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
of the research brand,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
then I will not purchase a product of the competing brand.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Accordingly, the buyer notes whether he agrees with this statement or not.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Here, the most various intentions of the buyer can be studied,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
depending on what interests us at the moment,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
or what aspects of our activity are relevant at the moment.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
And the last aspect,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
related to the buyer's attitude to goods,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
is the intention to buy.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Here, a simple scale is used,

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
from absolutely agreeable to completely agreeable.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And, accordingly, the intermediate values.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Here, we can find out what percentage of buyers

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
may or may not buy our product.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Then we will talk about the intention to buy,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
and see how this metric can be used to assess the potential volume of sales.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
The next metric, related to the consumer,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
is the consumer satisfaction.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
The consumer satisfaction can also be estimated quantitatively.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
In the slide, you can see an example

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
of how the consumer satisfaction was estimated quantitatively during the study.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
What conclusions can we draw from this assessment?

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Here, you can see that 50% of consumers are satisfied with goods or services

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
studied in this case.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
But we see that the extremely satisfied buyers are twice as few.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Well, and extremely unsatisfied are very few.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Accordingly, knowing the ratio of the group of buyers

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
with high satisfaction or low,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
we can draw the appropriate conclusions about our further actions.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
It rarely happens, or rather, it never happens,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
that all buyers are extremely satisfied with goods or services.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But the satisfaction of the buyer can be managed.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
How?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
First of all, by managing expectations.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
If a company creates high expectations about its goods or services,

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
then the buyers are not very pleased with their real performance of goods or services.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
It turns out that we are to blame for the reduction of satisfaction.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
If we do not increase the expectations of the buyers,

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
it may turn out that the buyers will say that they are more satisfied

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
with what they received, because they did not expect such a high level of service.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
For example, they did not expect that the goods would be of such high quality.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
The next metric used to study consumers is the desire to recommend.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
It is quite simple.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
During the survey of buyers, we determine

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
what percentage of buyers are ready to recommend our goods to the representatives of their reference group,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
for example, to their friends or acquaintances.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
The next metric is more complex — the desire to search.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
It means that there are buyers who will not purchase the goods of the competitor

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
without discovering that our goods are available.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
In this case, we will call them the ones who want to search.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Having determined the percentage of buyers who want to search for our goods,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
regardless of whether they are in the store or not,

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
and will not buy the goods of another brand,

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
this percentage is called the desire to search.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
The next metric related to buyers is the coefficient of retention of consumers.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
This is not such a simple coefficient.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
To calculate it, we need to know how many consumers we were able to retain,

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
that is, to keep them as customers among those we could lose.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
It is not so easy to determine how many buyers we could lose during a certain period.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
If we use the contract system of relations,

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
we can assume that if a contract with our company is signed with a buyer at the moment,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
and it does not expire in the near future,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
that is, it expires beyond the limits of the period we are considering,

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
we can say that this buyer is not at risk of loss.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
We do not consider him as the one we could lose,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
and do not take into account the coefficient of retention of buyers.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
We take into account only those who we could lose, but did not lose.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
The next metric is the profitability of consumers.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
It is not a secret that different buyers bring different levels of profit to the company.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Some of them buy very little or buy only at low prices,

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
others buy a large number of goods and buy at high prices.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
To know how to distribute the efforts to serve and establish a relationship with different consumers,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
the company needs to understand the profitability of a particular buyer.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
In addition, we consider the so-called consumer value.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
The consumer value is the entire flow of money that we will receive from him

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
during the entire period of interaction with this buyer.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
This period can be several decades.

35:07.000 --> 35:13.000
Therefore, if the company at some point wants to take actions that may lead to the loss of a client,

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
for example, not to agree to a price reduction or to refuse to provide special conditions for a certain client,

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
the company should remember that there are many years of possible profitable relationships ahead.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
In order not to lose this long-term focus,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
each company should assess the value of the relationship with each client.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
Finally, the next metrics related to the buyer are the cost of retention and the cost of attracting buyers.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
There is nothing complicated here, we just assess what costs we need to bear

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
in order to attract one buyer and what costs are necessary to retain one buyer.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
It is no secret that retaining a buyer is much cheaper than attracting a new one.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Sometimes the difference in these costs reaches tens of times.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
Nevertheless, most often companies try to attract new clients,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
while spending large amounts of money.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
They pay less attention to their old clients,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
and they can refuse to provide services or goods to the company,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
leaving the competition, and many companies do not even notice this,

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
considering that they do not need old clients, they need to attract as many new ones as possible.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
In order for the company not to forget what the costs are for these two types of activities,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
for retention and for attraction, it is necessary to calculate them.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
We have discussed the main metrics related to the market and buyers.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Now we will discuss the questions related to the profit.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Why are we discussing this question now?

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
The fact is that the knowledge of profit, retention and margin

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
will help us to calculate the next, more complex marketing metrics,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
which we will discuss later.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
So, here our main concepts are margin and retention.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
What is the difference?

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
Margin can be calculated in rubles or other monetary units, as well as in percents.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
In rubles, the margin is the difference between the price of a product,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
that is, the price per unit of a product, and the cost of the product.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Usually, these are full costs, that is, variable costs plus constant costs.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
The margin can be considered in percents,

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
as the ratio of the margin in monetary units, for example, in rubles,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
to the price per unit of the product.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Here it is necessary to distinguish the concept of margin and retention.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
If we say that the margin is measured in percents,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
the retention is also in percents,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
we cannot say that it is the same thing, it is not the same thing at all.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
What is the difference?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The margin is the percentage of the price of a product,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
that is, of the entire price value,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and the retention is the percentage of the costs.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
To calculate the retention,

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
we need to multiply the percentage of the retention by the costs.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
To calculate the margin,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
we need to multiply the percentage of the margin by the cost of the product,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
and this will result in different quantities.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And finally, what is the retention?

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Retention is the difference between the price of a product and the variable costs.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Knowing the retention, we can calculate the margin for the variable costs,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
as the ratio of the retention to the price per unit of the product.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Now let's do the following task.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
In the workbook, you are offered to calculate the margin and retention

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
using a certain example.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Let's look at such a metric as marketing costs.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
Any company should understand what its marketing costs are

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
and be sure to take them into account.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
But the knowledge of marketing costs in units of money

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
does not always give the right answer.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
You can't compare the marketing costs of other companies,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
because they may depend on the scale of the activity.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
And for this, companies often calculate the marketing costs

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
as a percentage of the sales volume.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
In many industries, there are some common standards

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
about the average marketing costs of companies in this industry.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And knowing this standard,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
you can calculate the marketing costs

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
of companies in this industry.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Knowing this average level,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
a company can compare its own indicator with the average

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
and understand whether it spends more or less.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And if it spends more, is it justified?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
And why does it do it?

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
That is, to make a conscious decision to spend more on marketing than competitors.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Now let's move on to the next important indicator.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
This is the target sales volume.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
What is the target sales volume? Why calculate it?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
What are the main goals for profit?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And to achieve a certain profit,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
you need to understand the sales volume

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
that a company needs to achieve this profit.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
That is, what is the minimum sales volume

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
that we need to achieve to get the desired profit.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Pay attention to the formula.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Here we use the following quantities.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Constant company costs, target profit and return.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
You remember that the return is the difference

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
between the price of the product and the variable costs

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
for the production of this product.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Knowing these four quantities,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
a company can calculate

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
what sales volume it needs to achieve

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
to get the desired profit at this price level

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
and at this level of costs.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Complete the task in the workbook

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and calculate what sales volume a company needs to achieve

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
to get the desired profit.

41:01.000 --> 41:07.000
How to calculate the sales volume?

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Now let's move on to the next block of metrics.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
These are metrics related to sales management.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Let's divide the metrics related to sales management

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
into two groups.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Those metrics that are related to management

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
of household staff, that is, sales managers.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
They can be called differently.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
They are people who deal with personal sales in the company.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
The second group of metrics is related to distribution channels.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
When we use not personal sales, but intermediaries.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
First, let's consider metrics related to personal sales,

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
that is, management of household staff.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
You can see on the slide that there are at least four options

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
for calculating the efficiency coefficient of household staff.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
It's a good idea to choose one of these options

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
and use it in your work.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Many companies do it.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
They choose a coefficient and use it

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
to compare different employees

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
to study the results of their work.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
To set rewards for certain employees

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
or to set sales goals.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
But it's not that simple.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Any company should use several efficiency coefficients

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
of household staff.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
It helps to understand what the problems are

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
if we don't reach the desired sales level.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Let's consider this problem as an example.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Solve the problem from a workbook

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that describes the activities of two managers

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
of Vasily Stepan.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Then we'll discuss the results

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
and what recommendations you can give to the company

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
when working with this staff.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
So, what conclusions can we draw?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
We can see that Vasily's sales manager

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
has a rather low sales volume

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
for the number of contacts.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
What does it mean?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It means that this manager lacks

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
the skills of personal sales

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
and the skills of making deals.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
He makes a lot of efforts to sell the product,

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
but it doesn't work out.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
So, we can make a decision

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
to offer the manager additional training opportunities

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and send him to a personal sales training

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
or offer other options to improve his skills.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Now let's compare Vasily's results

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
with Stepan's.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
We can see that Stepan's manager

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
has a rather high sales volume for each contact.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
But his sales level is almost the same.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
What is Stepan's problem?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Maybe he makes insufficient efforts

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
to carry out his household activities.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
He simply doesn't spend much time on sales.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
What is the reason?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
We need to understand the reason

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
of Stepan's behavior.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
In this case, personal sales training won't help him.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
He already knows how to make deals.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
He just doesn't actively contact the customer.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
What can we do here?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
What are the options?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
First of all, it's possible that Stepan

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
doesn't have enough motivation to work actively.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
In this case, we need to think about his reward

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
and maybe offer additional motivating factors.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
The second option, which is also common,

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
is that this manager doesn't have enough time

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
to establish contact with potential customers.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
He is overloaded with other work,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
for example, filling documents,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
collecting information about sales,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
and other responsibilities,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
which prevent him from fully

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
carrying out sales and contacting customers.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
We can see that in these two examples,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
in the case of Vasiliy and Stepan,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
we need different strategies.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
The different efficiency coefficients

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
from the household staff helped us to understand

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
what we should do.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The next important quantitative indicators

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
are the costs for one deal.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
To calculate the costs for one deal,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
we need to divide the total cost

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
for the household activity of the company

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
into the number of deals

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
or the number of sold goods.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Why do we need to take into account

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
the costs for one deal?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It often happens that the costs for one deal

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
of a certain sales manager are quite high.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
What can it be connected with?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
It can be connected with the fact that

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
this manager cannot distinguish

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
a prospective customer from a non-prospective one,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
and thus spends his time and resources

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
on him.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
There are situations when the sales manager

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
gives too many samples of the product

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
to everyone who wants it,

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
and not necessarily to those who really

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
plan to purchase the product.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
In this case, the costs for one deal

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
can also increase.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Therefore, each company should control

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
the costs for each deal in general

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
and the costs for each deal

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
of each particular employee

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
who sells goods or services to the company.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
The next indicator that each company

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
should calculate is the amount of

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
the household staff that is not lost.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
This is the number of sales managers

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
that the company can afford

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
to maximize

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
so that its activity does not become lost.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
The calculated amount of the household staff

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
that is not lost

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
allows us to achieve

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
a non-negative profit.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
In order to achieve a positive profit,

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
the number of household staff

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
should be less than the calculated amount

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
of the household staff that is not lost.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Let's consider a task from a workbook

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
that requires us to calculate

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
the maximum number of sales managers

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
that can afford to lose

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
so that their profit is not negative.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
After we have considered

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
the main quantitative indicators

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
related to the management of household staff

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
that deals with personal sales in the company,

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
we move on to the consideration of those metrics

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
that are used in the management

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
of distribution channels.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
In other words, in those situations

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
we need to consider

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
the number of sales managers

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
that can afford to lose

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
so that their profit is not negative.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
The first indicator is the distribution coverage.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
In order to calculate the distribution coverage,

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
we need to divide the number of sales managers

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
that sell our product

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
or the products of our brand

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
into the total number of sales managers

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
working in the area

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
that is being studied.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
It is impossible to say

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
that the distribution coverage

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
should be the highest

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
or vice versa the lowest.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Why?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Because the distribution coverage

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
should correspond to our sales strategy.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
If we say that we are making

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
an intensive sales,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
then, of course,

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
the distribution coverage

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
should be large.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
That is, a large number of sales managers

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
should offer our product to the buyers.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
If we find that

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
with an intensive sales coverage

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
the distribution coverage

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
is large enough,

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
then we need to attract

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
more sales managers.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
If, on the contrary,

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
we say that we have an exclusive sales,

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
but we find that

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
the distribution coverage

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
is large enough,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
that many companies

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
sell our product,

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
then this sales cannot be called exclusive.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
And here we also need to make adjustments.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
The next indicator

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
that we should calculate

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
for the distribution channels,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
that is, for the use of intermediaries,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
is the share of the shelf.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
What is the share of the shelf?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
This is the ratio of the number of places

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
belonging to our products on the shelf,

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
for example, a supermarket or a hypermarket,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
to the total number of places on the shelf.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
I mean the shelf

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
dedicated to the products

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
of a certain product category.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Why is this important?

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
We can say that the share of the shelf

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
is, in a sense, the share of the market.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
If we consider the shelf

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
as a market,

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
because the buyer,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
who is in the store,

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
chooses from the products

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
that he sees on the shelf of the supermarket.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Thus, the more places on the shelf

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
belong to us,

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
that is, the higher the share of the shelf,

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
this indicator that we calculate,

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
the higher the probability

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
that the buyer will buy our product.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
To increase the share of the shelf,

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
many companies

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
resort to various tricks.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
One of the strategies

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
is to create new trading brands.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
If a company has several brands,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
it will take up more space

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
on the shelves of the supermarket

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
than if the company

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
had only one brand.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Thus, the probability

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
that the buyer will buy

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
our product increases.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Another option

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
is to create

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
a modification of the product.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Let's say, when a company

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
offers several modifications

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
of a product under one brand,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
the share of the shelf

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
is usually higher.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
The third factor

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
that we study

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
is the absence of the product

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
in the warehouse.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
It is sometimes called

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
out of stock.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
This is the ratio

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
of the number of intermediaries

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
who do not have our product

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
at a certain time,

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
at the moment of measurement.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
It is sold there,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
we work with this intermediary,

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
and the ratio of the number of intermediaries

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
is the total number

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
of intermediaries

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
we work with.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
This factor can also be a source

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
of possible problems.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
If we find that

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
the absence of the product

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
in the warehouse is high,

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
we need to improve

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
the system of our product movement,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
to ensure that the product

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
is always available.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
If, for example, we find

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
that the distribution coverage is low,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
we need to improve

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
the system of our product movement.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
We see that

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
using these metrics,

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
calculating these quantitative indicators,

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
the company can diagnose

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
the reason for their problems

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
with sales and sales.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Now we move on

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
to the next group of marketing metrics

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
that are related to the product policy of the company.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Now we will talk

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
about the development of new products.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
When a company develops a new product

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
and offers it to its buyers,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
it is necessary to calculate

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
the coefficient of trial purchases

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
and the coefficient of repeated purchases.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
In the slide you can see

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
how these coefficients are calculated.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
To calculate the coefficient of trial purchases,

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
we need to divide the number of buyers

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
who tried the product

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
by the total number of potential buyers.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
The coefficient of repeated purchases

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
is the ratio of the number of buyers

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
who bought our product again

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
to all those who tried it.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Please note that

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
the coefficient of repeated purchases

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
is the ratio of the number of buyers

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
who tried the product

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
and not all potential buyers.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
As a rule,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
these coefficients are calculated

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
by the results of marketing research.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
A survey is conducted

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
to determine

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
whether potential buyers

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
intend to buy a certain product

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
and the percentage of buyers

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
who buy it

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
is determined

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
by the coefficient of repeated purchases.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Now let's look at the next diagram.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
In this case,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
we will analyze

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
how the coefficient of repeated purchases

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
and the information

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
about possible trial purchases

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
can help us

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
determine the predicted volume of sales.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Let's imagine

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
that we conducted a marketing research,

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
surveyed potential buyers

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
and asked them

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
to name a certain product

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
and to name a certain product.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
The product is shown in the form of a sample

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
or described in detail

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
by its main characteristics.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Let's imagine

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
that we had a 5-point rating scale

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
and the upper values of this scale

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
4 and 5

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
meant that

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
the buyer will probably buy our product

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
or the buyer will definitely buy our product,

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
that is, most likely to buy.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
The lower values

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
are the ones

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
that are not shown

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
in the scale.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
We take all those buyers

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
in the percentage

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
of the total number of respondents

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
who will probably buy our product

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
and who will definitely buy,

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
that is, will definitely buy our product

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
and calculate what percentage

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
they make up

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
of the total number of respondents.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
And this value

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
can be considered

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
as the coefficient of trial purchases.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
That is, this is the number of buyers,

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
the share of buyers

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
who will buy our new product.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
We cannot use this value

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
to calculate

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
the total sales volume

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
directly.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Why?

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Because not all potential buyers

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
are aware of our product.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
And you remember that we calculated

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
the coefficient of awareness,

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
that is, the percentage of potential buyers

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
who know about the existence of our product.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
And in order to determine

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
how many people

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
will buy our product,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
we need

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
all those people

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
who would buy the product,

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
probably bought

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
or definitely bought

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
under the conditions of knowing

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
this product,

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
under the conditions of awareness,

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
multiply by the coefficient of awareness,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
that is, remove from this number of buyers

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
all those who do not know

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
about our product at the moment.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
And only in this way

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
we can determine the predicted

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
volume of trial purchases.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
We can multiply

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
the volume of trial purchases

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
by this coefficient

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
and get the estimated number

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
of repeated purchases.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
We assume that when a buyer tries to buy,

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
he buys one unit of the product,

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
but when he tries to buy again,

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
he can buy more units of the product

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
for one purchase.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Thus, we need the number of buyers

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
who plan to make a second purchase

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
multiplied by the number of units of the product

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
that they plan to buy on average,

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
and then multiply by the frequency

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
of the transaction.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
When we talk about trial purchases,

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
we assume that a trial purchase

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
is made once,

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
and any subsequent one

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
will be considered as a second one.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
When we talk about second purchases,

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
then in the following period of time

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
a buyer can make several

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
second purchases.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Therefore, knowing the estimated

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
number of buyers who should make

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
a second purchase

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
and knowing how many units of the product

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
they will buy,

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
we must multiply this number

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
by the estimated frequency

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
of the purchase.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Only after this,

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
we will be able to get the estimated

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
number of repeated purchases.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Pay attention to the diagram.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
You see that

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
the total estimated volume of sales

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
consists of the estimated volume

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
of trial purchases

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
and the estimated volume of repeated purchases.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Knowing the coefficients of trial purchases

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
and the coefficients of repeated purchases,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
we can calculate

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
the estimated volume of sales.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Now, do the task from the workbook.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Calculate the estimated volume of sales

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
for a certain new product.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Now, let's move on to the next metric

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
within the framework of the company's

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
product policy.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
This metric is associated with the concept

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
of commodity cannibalism.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
This situation occurs when

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
a new product appears in the company.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
And inevitably, this new product

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
eats up part of the volume of sales

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
of the old product.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
To determine which part of the volume of sales

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
of the old product will be eaten up

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
by a new product,

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
we use the coefficient of cannibalization.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
We divide the lost sales,

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
that is, the sales that we lost

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
as a result of the introduction

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
of a new product into the market

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
as a result of the introduction

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
of a new product into the market,

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
that is, the sale of an old product,

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
into the volume of sales of a new product.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
And what does this coefficient of cannibalization

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
allow us to understand?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
It shows us whether it is reasonable

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
from the point of view of the volume of sales

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
and profits

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
of introducing a new product into the market.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
If the coefficient of cannibalization

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
is less than 100%,

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
it turns out that we have lost

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
the volume of sales less than we received

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
due to the introduction of a new product

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
into the market.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
There are situations when

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
the coefficient of cannibalization

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
is 100%.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
This means that a new product

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
has completely replaced an old product.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
And here the change in the profit of the company

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
depends on the margin

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
of a new and old product.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
If the margin of a new product is greater,

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
then the profit of the company will increase.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
There are situations when

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
the coefficient of cannibalization

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
exceeds 100%.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
What does this mean?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
The amount of new products

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
has decreased to a greater extent

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
than the volume of sales of new products.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
What can this be connected with?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Usually, this happens in cases

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
when buyers,

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
having seen that a new product

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
has appeared,

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
improved, modified,

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
more attractive,

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
refuse to purchase an old product,

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
but at the same time

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
they have not yet purchased a new one,

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
either because they do not have enough money

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
to purchase it,

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
but because they have not yet

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
purchased a new product.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
In this case, the coefficient of cannibalization

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
exceeds 100%.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
This can be dangerous for the company.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It turns out that it has lost

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
an old product,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and the new product has not yet

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
started to work in the market.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Now let's complete the task

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
from the workbook

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and calculate the coefficient of cannibalization

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
for a certain new product.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The cost of the new product

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Now we move on

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
to a very important question.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The metric is called

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
the market capital.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The market capital is considered

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
to be the main non-material asset

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
of the company.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Due to the market capital,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the company can get

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
a large amount of additional profit.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
In fact, the market capital

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
is the additional profit,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
that is, it is the increase in profit

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
of the company

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
due to the ownership of a certain brand.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
If we take a situation

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
when a company sells a certain product

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
under its own brand,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and take another situation

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
when a company sells a similar product,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
but without this brand,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and compare the profit obtained

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
in the first and second cases,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
we can understand

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
what part of the profit,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
what amount

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
the company gets

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
due to the brand.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The larger the market capital,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the greater the additional profit

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
the company can get

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
due to its own brand.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Many researchers

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
proposed different algorithms

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and methods of calculating the market capital.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Let's take a look at several of these methods.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
The first method

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
was proposed by the advertising agency

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Young and Rubicon.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Here you can see

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
the four indicators

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
that measure the market capital.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
That is, the perceived difference

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
between the brand's life,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
brand's respect and brand's knowledge.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
If we compare

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
our brand

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
with the brand of a competitor

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and give certain assessments

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
regarding the brand's respect

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and brand's knowledge,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
our brand's knowledge

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and the brand's knowledge of the competitor,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
it is better to do these measurements

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
not with the help of employees,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
but using the opinion of consumers.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
By comparing the assessments

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
on these four indicators,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
the company can understand

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the market capital of which brand

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
is higher than our brand

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
or the brand of the competitor

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and make the appropriate conclusions.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The next method is similar.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You can see that it differs

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
only by two characteristics

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
according to which the market capital is assessed.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
The first is the attractiveness of the brand,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
that is, the degree

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
to which the buyers want to buy the product,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
how attractive it is for them,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and the trust in the brand.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The same algorithm

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
is used by the company

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
to conduct a survey of the buyers

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
in order to determine

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
which brand

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
or brand of the competitor

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
has more market capital.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It is impossible to say

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
that there are brands

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
that have high indicators

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
according to all these characteristics.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
This probably does not happen.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
There are some trends.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Research shows that

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
brands that have existed for a long time

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
receive higher grades

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
in terms of uniqueness

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and relevance in the lifestyle of the buyers.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
More modern new brands

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
receive high grades

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
in terms of uniqueness and relevance,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
but low grades

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
in terms of knowledge and respect,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
because they have existed on the market

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
not so long ago.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
The next method

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
is the so-called Morin method.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Here we get

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
a more quantitative assessment.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Here we can compare

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
the market capital of our brand

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and the brand of competitors

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
not only on a regular scale,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that is, we can say not only

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
which brand has higher

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
or lower market capital,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
but we can also compare

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
how much higher

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and how much lower.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You see the formula.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The market capital is the sum of the market share

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
relative price and loyalty index.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Relative price.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
What is it?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It is the percentage

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
of the price of our product,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
the product of our brand,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
higher than the price

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
of the product of the competitor's brand.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And we see the following logic here.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
The higher the market share,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the higher the brand capital.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And this is quite logical.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
If the product has a higher market share,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
then, apparently,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
this brand is attractive for buyers

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and, perhaps, the brand capital

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
is really higher.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
The second aspect is the relative price.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Here we see the following logic.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Indeed,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
if the price of our product,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
the product of our brand,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
is higher than the price of the competitor's product,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and we really sell the product

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
at this price and still exist,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
then, apparently,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
there are some objective reasons

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
why buyers pay more for our product.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Therefore, we have more market capital.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And the next component of this formula

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
is the loyalty index.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The loyalty index

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
is the percentage of buyers

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
who stated during the poll

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
that they plan to purchase our product,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
to continue purchasing

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
our brand's product next year.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Here we see the following logic.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The more loyal buyers we have,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the higher the market capital.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And now,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
do the task from the workbook.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Compare the market capital

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
of your brand

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and the brand of the competitor

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
you have chosen for analysis

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
and draw a conclusion

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
whose market capital is higher.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The next step is to make a decision.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
The decision is made

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
based on the market capital

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
of the competitor.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Now we move on

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
to the next group of marketing metrics

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
related to price management.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The first indicator

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
that we need to consider

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
is the price premium.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
This is the ratio

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
of the difference between the price of our product

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and the price of the competitor's product

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
to the price of the competitor's product.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Knowing the price premium,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
we can understand

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
how much our product is more expensive

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
than the competitor's product.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Despite the price premium,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
it can have a negative meaning.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That is,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
we need to measure the price premium

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
at all stages of product distribution.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That is, at the level of the manufacturer's price,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
at the level of the wholesale price

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and at the level of the retail price.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
By calculating the price premium

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
of our products regularly,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
we can see

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the price premium of our products

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
relative to the competitors'.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
There are situations

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
when the price premium

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
at the level of the manufacturer

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
has the same value

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and at the level of the wholesale price

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
has a completely different value.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Here we can see

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
how the power distribution changes.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The next indicator

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
that we need to consider

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
is the so-called reserve price.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
What is a reserve price?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
A reserve price is the price

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
at which our product is sold.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
You can see it

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
on the slide of the chart

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
where the reserve price is located.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
There is also an indicator

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
of the maximum willingness to buy.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This is the volume of sales

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
that we have

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
at a price equal to zero.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Someone may say

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
that if the price of our product is zero,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
then all our products will be taken away.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
This is not always the case.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Here we can say

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
that if the price is zero,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
then we will not sell our products,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
because many buyers

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
will want to buy our products for free.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But in fact,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
the purchasing possibilities

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
have their own limitations.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Therefore, the volume of sales

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
at a zero price is not infinite,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
but has a certain level.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Pay attention to the chart

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
where we can see

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
the maximum willingness to buy.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
If we connect the points

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
of maximum willingness to buy

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and the reserve price,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
we will get

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
a linear demand function.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Why do we study the reserve prices?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Knowing the reserve price,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
the variable cost per unit of the product,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
we can easily calculate

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the optimal price of our product.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It would seem

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
that this is not too simple.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
First, we need to make sure

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that the optimal price

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
has a certain level of demand.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
If we calculate the optimal price

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
of our product,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
we can calculate

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
the optimal price

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
that maximizes the profit of the company

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
according to this formula.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Let's check

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
whether this is true.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
On the slide you will see a table

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
where various price options

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
for products from 0 to 5 are presented,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
the corresponding volume of sales,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the variable costs,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
which in all cases are the same,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and the maximum willingness to buy.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
You are offered to calculate

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
the difference between the price

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and the variable costs

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
and calculate the total return.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
After we fill in

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
all the empty cells in this table,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
we will be able to find

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
what price maximizes

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
the total return,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
in fact, our profit.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Let's try to calculate it

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
using the formula.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
So, our reserve price

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
is 0.5.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
So, our reserve price

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
is 5.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
When the price is 5,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the volume of sales is 0.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
The variable cost per unit of the product

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
according to our table

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
is 1.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
That is, 5 plus 1 is 6,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
divide by 2,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and according to the formula,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
our optimal price

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
with a linear demand function

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
should be 3.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Let's check

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
whether this is true.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We calculated the return

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
in each case,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and then calculated the total return,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
multiplying the return

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
from the unit of the product

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
by the volume of sales.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And we got that

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
in case when the price is 3 rubles,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
the total return will be maximum,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
it will be 4.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That is, it turns out

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
that this formula really allows us

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
to calculate the optimal price

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
in terms of profit maximization.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Now let's consider

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
the next important indicator,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
that is, the elasticity of demand for the price.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The elasticity of demand for the price

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
is calculated as

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
the ratio of the change in the volume of sales

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
to the change in the price.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
What does elasticity mean?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The meaning of the elasticity indicator

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
is that it helps us to determine

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
how many percent

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
the volume of sales will change

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
when the price changes by 1%.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
For example,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
if our elasticity of demand for the price

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
is equal to minus 5,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
it means that

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
when the price increases by 1%,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
our volume of sales

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
decreases by 5%.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Why does it decrease?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Because the indicator is equal to minus 5.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
The minus sign means

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
that we have a connection

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
between the price and the demand,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
in this case, the opposite.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Now, do the task from the workbook.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The next indicator

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
that is usually calculated

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
in price education

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
is the so-called price cascade.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There are often cases

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
when the price

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that the buyer pays for the product

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
is seriously different

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
from the price in the price list,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
because there are various discounts.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Discounts for the volume of sales,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
discounts for the constant price,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
discounts for the change in the price,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
discounts for the change in the price,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
discounts for the change in the price,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
discounts for the change in the price,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
discounts for certain payment conditions,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
these discounts are especially common

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
in the industrial market.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And to understand

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
how much the real price of transactions

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
differs from the price in the price list,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
we calculate the price cascade,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
that is, the attitude of the real price

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to the price in the price list.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Do the task from the workbook.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Now we move on to the next group of marketing metrics,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
these are the metrics for the promotion of a product.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Let's divide the promotion of a product in this case into two parts.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Metrics in the stimulus of sales and metrics in advertising.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
First, let's consider the metrics in the stimulus of sales.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Almost every company has carried out at least once

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
a promotion of a product,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
offered discounts to its customers.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But in order to understand the purpose of offering

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
different discounts in different situations to your customers,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
it is necessary to calculate in advance

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
how much sales volume is needed

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
to ensure the profitability of our promotion of a product.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
That is, how much we should increase the sales volume

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
so that our profit does not decrease

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
due to the fact that we offer discounts to our customers.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
In the slide you can see the formula.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Knowing the size of the estimated discount

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and the marginal profit per unit of the product,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
we can calculate how much our sales volume should increase,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
to minimize the loss of money

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
as a result of this promotion,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
as a result of the offer of discounts.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Now, complete the task in your notebook.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Now we move on to the metrics related to advertising.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
The main metrics used in advertising and media planning

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
are impression, coverage, frequency and assessment coefficients.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
What does it all mean?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Impression is the number of potential contacts

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of the target audience with our advertising message.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Coverage is the number of people,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
the number of representatives of the target audience

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
who had the opportunity to see our advertising message

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
during a certain show.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Pure coverage is the number of representatives of the target audience

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
who actually saw our advertising message.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
The coverage is the number of people who could see it,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
but we don't know if they saw it or not.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Pure coverage is the number of people who saw it,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
we know it.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
This information is obtained during marketing research.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Frequency is the number of times

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
the representative of the target audience

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
could see our message on average.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And the more complex metric is the assessment coefficient

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
or rating point.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
The percentage of representatives of the target audience

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
who had the opportunity to see our advertising message

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
may seem to be the same as coverage.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The target audience is the same,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and we count who could see our advertising message.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But in case of coverage,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
the number of people is the indicator.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
In case of rating point,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
the indicator is in percentages.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Although it is often indicated without the percentage sign.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
If the rating point is 5,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
it means that 5% of the target audience

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
had the opportunity to see our advertising message.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
If the coverage is 5,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
it means that 5 people

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
had the opportunity to see our advertising message.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And finally, the Graphical Rating Point.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Sometimes it is simply called GRP.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It is the rating point

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
accumulated by all the indicators of our advertising message.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
To better understand how it is calculated

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and what all these indicators mean,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
let's look at an example.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
So, let's imagine that our target audience is 5 people.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And we had 5 indicators of our advertising message.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
You can see in the table

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
that the pluses mean that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
this representative of the target audience

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
had the opportunity to see our message.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
The minuses mean that

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
he did not have the opportunity to see our advertising message

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
at the time of this show.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
We are calculating the impression.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Try to calculate the impression indicator yourself.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
That is, the number of potential contacts of the target audience.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Calculating the impression

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
and knowing what our target audience is in general,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
that is, 100%,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and 100% is 5 people,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
we can calculate the rating point

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
as a percentage of those representatives of the target audience

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
who could see the message

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
in relation to the audience of the target audience.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And this percentage

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
is calculated

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
by the number of contacts of the target audience.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And this percentage

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
is calculated

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
by the number of contacts of the target audience.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And when we calculate all the rating points,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
that is, the points for each show,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
we can add them up,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and we get the value of the rating point.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Let's see what the answers should be.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
You see that for each show we calculated the impression.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
That is, how many contacts

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
of the target audience were there for each show.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
If we had 3 impressions,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and the target audience is 5 people,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
then this is 60%.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
That is, the rating point for the first show is 60%.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And so on.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
We calculate and, in the end,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
adding up all the rating points for each show,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
we get the value of the rating point.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The next indicators used in media planning

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
are the effective frequency

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and effective coverage.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
You remember that frequency is the average number of times

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
that a representative of the target audience

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
could see our message.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Effective frequency is the number of times

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
that, in our opinion,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
a customer needs to not only see,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
but also perceive, understand our message.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
In many cases, it is quite obvious

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
that seeing the message once is not enough.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The customer may not record anything from this message,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and, accordingly, it will not affect

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
his behavior when making purchases.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That is why, most often,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
companies set a certain effective frequency,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
that is, the minimum number of times

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
that the message should be seen

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
so that something happens in the customer's head,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
so that it somehow affects his behavior.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And, having established an effective frequency,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
we can calculate effective coverage.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Effective coverage is the number of representatives

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
of the target audience

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
who could see our message

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and the number of times that the message should be seen.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That is, with an effective frequency.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Look at the table.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
You see that here we have the number of representatives

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
of the target audience

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
who had the opportunity to see our message

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
with a certain number of times,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
that is, with a certain frequency.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Suppose we establish that

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
an effective frequency is 3 for us.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Calculate what is the effective coverage in this case.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
We see that in this case,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
only those who have seen our message

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
three or more times

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
get under the effective coverage.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
That is, we add up the number of representatives

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
of the target audience

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
who saw the message three times,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
four times and five times

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
and get 98,000 people.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
This is our effective coverage.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And we see that

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
the number of people who saw our message

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
three times, four times and five times

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
get 98,000 people.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
This is our effective coverage.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
The following metrics have a more general nature.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
They reflect the effectiveness of marketing as a whole.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Surely, many of you have encountered

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
the indicators of profitability and sales.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
This indicator is calculated as

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
net profit as a percentage of revenue.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Profitability of investments

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
or return on investment

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
is also probably familiar to many.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Here we have

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
the indicators calculated as net profit

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
as a percentage of our investments.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
But there is a specific indicator in marketing.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
This is profitability of marketing investments.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It is called RMI.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Here we take the conversion of sales volume

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
obtained precisely due to marketing activity,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
that is, the volume of sales

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
that would not have been without marketing,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
multiply by the return,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
and you remember that this is

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
the difference in price and variable costs,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
and subtract from this value

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
the costs of marketing.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
In fact, this is how we calculate

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
the conversion of our profit

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
obtained as a result of marketing activity.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And we divide this value by the costs of marketing.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
The higher the RMI of the investment in marketing,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
the more effective

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
the marketing activity of the company.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Now, do the task from the workbook.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Calculate the profitability of investment in marketing

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
according to the proposed condition.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So, having considered the main marketing metrics,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
we now have to analyze

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
how we can use them

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
for a more complex assessment

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
of our marketing activity

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and for the control of marketing in the company.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
The first element of control in marketing

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
is the control over the implementation of annual plans.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
What is the point here?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
At the beginning of the marketing plan, as we remember,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
companies choose indicators

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
according to which they will further control

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
their marketing activity.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And, of course, according to each indicator,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
the company sets a certain goal,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
which it would like to achieve.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
At the stage of control,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
we compare the target indicator

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and the real one,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
the one we have achieved

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
during a certain period.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The indicators

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
for which the control is carried out

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
for the implementation of the plans

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
are divided into several groups.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
First, this is an analysis of the profitability.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
These are all indicators

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
related to the goals for profitability.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Next, the goals for the market share are assessed.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Have we achieved the market share

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that was initially set as a goal?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Here we assess both the market share

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and the relative market share.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
We also assess the level of our marketing costs.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Have they exceeded the limit

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
that we have set?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And what is the ratio

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
of the result obtained

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
in terms of sales

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and the cost of the sales?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Another integral part

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
of the control for the implementation of the annual plans

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
is monitoring the consumers.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Here all the metrics are considered,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
which are related to the consumers

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
we have talked about.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
We set goals for awareness,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
for the perception of our product or our brand,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
for the attitude of the buyer,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
for the retention of the buyer,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and so on.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
We also monitor

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
whether we have achieved

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
the goals that we had set

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
at the beginning of our planning.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
We also monitor

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
whether we have achieved something.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We also conduct an analysis of the financial indicators

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
related to the achievement of the desired level of profit,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
level of return,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
level of margin.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
After the company has determined

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
whether the real business situation

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
is in line with the goals,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
whether the goals we had set at the beginning

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
have been achieved,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
the next step is the control of profitability.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Here, as a rule,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
the main indicators of profitability are calculated,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
profitability of sales,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
profitability of investments

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
and profitability of marketing investments.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And finally, if the company sees

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
that there are some problems

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
with achieving the goals,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
that is,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
the sales goals are not achieved,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
the market share does not correspond to the desired one,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
or the attitude to the product of the consumer

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
is not what we would like to get,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
then we plan to carry out

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
such a rather large-scale event

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
as a marketing audit.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
This is an independent study

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
of all the indicators of the company's activities,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
which allows us to understand

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
what are the reasons

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
for the insufficient achievement of the goals

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
and what the company needs to change.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The marketing audit

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
consists of several elements.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
We analyze the marketing environment

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and the marketing strategy,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
we analyze the organization of marketing in the company,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
we organize all the systems,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
everything related to marketing,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
because the roots of our problems

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
can lie in any of these elements.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
The conspectus and the working notebook

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
offer you a rather detailed plan,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
which is offered by foreign researchers

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
to companies for the purpose of

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
the marketing audit.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It contains a large number

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
of marketing aspects,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and if necessary,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
you can use this algorithm

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
to conduct a marketing audit

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
in your company.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The marketing audit offered

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
by foreign researchers

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is quite complex

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and involves a large-scale activity,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
which cannot be required of you

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
in the form of a mandatory task

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
within the framework of this course.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
But the Russian company

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
offers a simpler methodology,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
consisting of a questionnaire

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and its decoding.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
In the working notebook,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
in the conspectus,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
you can also find this questionnaire.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I suggest you answer the questions

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
of this questionnaire,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
which is essentially

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
an instrument of assessing

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
the effectiveness of marketing in the company

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and understand whether the effectiveness

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
of your marketing is high enough

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and whether you have a reason

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
to think about and conduct

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
a more detailed audit of your activity.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
How to conduct a marketing audit

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
in a strategic level

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
How to conduct a marketing audit

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
in a strategic level

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Now let's move on

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
to strategic control.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
To conduct control at a strategic level

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
means to understand

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
whether the company is moving

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
in the right direction in general

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
or there are some conceptual problems

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
that do not allow it

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
to be successful.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Strategic control consists of several stages.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
To begin with,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
we traditionally set the parameters

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
of our strategy assessment.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I mean the parameters of the strategy assessment,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
not the processes we talked about earlier.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
After that, the company must ensure

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
that all the necessary information

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
for assessment

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
is collected on a regular basis

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
in order to have the opportunity

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
to evaluate this information

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and use it for control.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
After we have collected information

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
about our activity

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
based on the selected parameters,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
we can compare

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
the real and the desired parameters.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And according to the results,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
the company makes a decision

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
about the adjustment.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
What situations do we have?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
There is a situation

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
when the planned results

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
correspond to the real results.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
This is probably the simplest situation.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But it is not always like that.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
There is a situation

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
when the real performance

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
of the company

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
is higher than the desired performance.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It is higher than the desired performance.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
What does it mean?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
We have overcompleted our plan?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
This is not good.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Why?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It means that we have set

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
inadequate goals.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
We need to reconsider our goals.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Maybe we have deliberately

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
or unconsciously lowered the bar

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and did not reach the results

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
we could have achieved.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
In a situation when

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
the real performance is worse

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
than the planned performance,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
the company usually

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
needs to make adjustments.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
What does it mean to make adjustments?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
There are no obvious solutions.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
First of all,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
after we get

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
a negative result,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
we see that the implementation of the strategy

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
did not give us the desired results,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
we should pay attention

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
to the selected parameters

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and evaluation indicators.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Maybe we have chosen

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
the wrong evaluation indicators

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and that is why we have

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
not achieved a good result.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
If we have checked our parameters

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
and decided that they were

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
adequately selected

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
in terms of the current market situation,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
we should think

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
if our goals are adequate.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
If we confirm that

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
our goals are relevant

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and there is no point in changing them,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
we should pay attention

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
to the strategy.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Maybe the problem

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
in the implementation of the strategy

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
is that the strategy was chosen

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
incorrectly.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Only if we get a confirmation

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
that the strategy was chosen

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
correctly and corresponds

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
to the current situation

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
in the external and internal

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
environment of the company,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
only after that we make

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
a decision to adjust

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
the implementation of processes

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and operations in the company.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
We should make adjustments

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
to the evaluation indicators

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and the strategy before

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
the adjustment of operations.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Now, complete the following task

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
from the workbook.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
In conclusion,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I would like to note the following.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
First of all,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
the control of marketing activities

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
is certainly not a panacea.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
There are many situations

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
when the control

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
can only harm the company,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
namely, when the control is not carried out correctly.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Let's look at several situations

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
when the control

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
can be carried out with some mistakes.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
First,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
there is a common situation

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
when the control becomes

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
not a means of achieving

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
a certain result,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
when the company

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
carries out the control

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
only for the sake of

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
the process of the control.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And often in this situation

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
the ordinary employees suffer,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
who are under constant control.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
They do not see why

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
this control is carried out

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
and it really does not give anything to the company.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The second situation is related to the fact

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
that managers, as a result of large-scale

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
control measures and evaluation of activities,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
are simply overwhelmed

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
with information about the results,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
about the controlled indicators,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
and they simply do not have time

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
to figure out all the indicators

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
they receive

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and in fact do not use them.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
That is, reports

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
on the assessment of efficiency

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
simply fall on the shelf

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
and this does not give anything to the company.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Such situations must also be avoided.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And the third situation

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
when the control can only harm the company

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
occurs when the control

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
is used

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
for other purposes.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
For example,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
in some companies

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
the control of the results of marketing activities

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
is carried out

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
exclusively to harm

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
its employees in one way or another

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
according to the results of this control.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And often in such situations

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
the results are bad.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
More precisely, they are almost always bad

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
because the company sets

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
inevitably unattainable goals,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
inevitably overestimated.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It turns out that this control

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
is used by the company's top managers

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
to achieve other goals

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
that have nothing to do

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
with the efficiency of marketing.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I would like to wish you

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
to avoid these mistakes

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
in the implementation of the control

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
of marketing activities.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I would like to wish you

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
to really use the assessment

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
of the efficiency of marketing

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
in your companies.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I would like to believe

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
that all the formulas we have studied

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
will come in handy for you

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
in the implementation of the control

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
and assessment of marketing

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
in your company.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Good luck in acquiring new knowledge

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
and thank you for your attention.
