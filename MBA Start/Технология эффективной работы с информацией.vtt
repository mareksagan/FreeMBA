00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You are stuck in the sea of unnecessary information.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
Huge flows of information prevent you from making effective management decisions.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Then our course, Information Technology for You,

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
we focus on nuances of effective work with information,

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
which will allow you to make the right decisions quickly, efficiently and in time.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm Elena Burikova, a teacher of the Moscow Business School.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
So, today's topic is the technology of effective work with information.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Slide number two.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
In order to consider this program, we must clarify the importance of information for the manager,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
discuss who the consumers of information are,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
formulate an idea of the types of information,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
and consider the information problems and ways of their solution.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Slide number three.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Why did the topic of the technology of work with information arise?

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Because information processes are now greatly affecting the human community.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Humanity has felt a huge influence of information processes on the history of its development.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
And the most important thing is that the information is becoming more and more.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
And we cannot even predict the consequences of this,

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
that this information is becoming more and more.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
How does it all affect a person?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Slide number four.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
We will now deal with the concept of information.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
In fact, it is so familiar to us, we use this term so often,

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
that we often do not think about what it means.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
The term information comes from the Latin word,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
which means exposition, exposition and awareness.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
What is information in general?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
There are several definitions in the literature.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
In particular, information is information about objects, events, facts, processes and phenomena of the world around us.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
That is, it is information.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
The next definition.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
The next definition is already taken from the course of computer science.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Slide number six.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
In order to give a scientific definition of what information is,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
we need to introduce three more concepts.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
The object, the environment and the interaction.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
The object is something whole that exists in space and time and is finished.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
That is, the object is something holistic.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
The environment is a multitude of other potential objects

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
that interest us in terms of their influence on the state of the selected object that we are considering.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And the interaction is a process of mutual change of these objects over time,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
when they influence each other.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Slide number seven.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
In nature there are two functional types of interaction.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
This is the exchange of matter and energy.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
These are fundamental types.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Why?

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
Because all other interactions are based on the exchange of matter or energy.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And here is the question, of course, the law of conservation of work.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
That is, the energy that is exchanged by objects does not disappear anywhere.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
When objects interact, a certain limited environment arises.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
And in this environment, neither matter nor energy is lost.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
If one object gave the matter and energy, then the other one changed, because it accepted.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
And any interaction between objects, in the process of which one acquires,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
and the other loses some substance, is called an informational interaction.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And this most transmitted substance is called information.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
This is such a scientific definition of information from the science of informatics.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Two of the most common properties of information follow from this definition.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Information cannot exist outside the interaction of objects.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
And information is not lost by any of the objects in the interaction process.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Slide number 9.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
A number of terms that we will use in our course.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Information generalization.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
This is the transformation of information from a small multitude of simple private events into information of a higher level.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
In which these private events are included as elements.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Information exchange is carried out between people, objects, living nature, and technical devices.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And information processes are the processes of transmission, storage, processing and search of information.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
So, based on this definition, information can be coordinated with our senses.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
It can be visual, auditory, tactile, perceptual and kinesthetic.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
This is when our movements, we move, and information is transmitted to the brain about how we move.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
This is a general classification of information.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
But we are interested in business information.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Business information is classified in the following ways.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
This is verbal, non-verbal information.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
Mimics, gestures, poses, distances are related to non-verbal.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
Business information in this classification is all verbal.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Therefore, we will talk about business information only.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Slide number 10.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So, what is business information?

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Business information is information about objects, events, facts, processes, and phenomena.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Which relates to the sphere of economic activity.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
And is used to make decisions in the business system.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
It is very important why we need this information.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
We need information only for one thing.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
In order to make decisions correctly.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
So that the company can work effectively and achieve its goals.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
What is business information?

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Business information is professional knowledge that entrepreneurs and employees have.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Technological knowledge of the specialist.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Assumptions with a certain degree of probability about the subjects of interest.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
And about the position that the company and its competitors occupy in the market and in the world.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
All the information that relates to this area is business.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Slide number 12.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I will just comment on this and remind you.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
That there are several types of resources in the organization.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
These are information, time, financial, material, human and power.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
And it is not in vain that information resources are put on the forefront.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Because they are really now moving forward.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And who owns information, he owns the world.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
In order to be a leader, you must produce some new information.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
You must be able to use the information that already exists.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Because only when you know what already exists, you can come up with something new.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
And market leaders, they just lead in information.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
What do they lead in?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Slide number 13.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Information today has become an economic resource and a commodity of primary necessity.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
We have come to such a state that when information has become a commodity,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
and a commodity of primary necessity, it is bought and sold.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And who buys the most effective information,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
he can make the most effective decisions and, accordingly, be more effective.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Accordingly, all this is poured out into the financial component.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
And it is all given to us by choice.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
That is, having bought the necessary and effective information,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
we thereby make investments in order to get the profit

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
exactly in the size we would like.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
The most relevant information provision, in increasing degree,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
will determine the effectiveness of the use of all the production potential.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
So, we have already said about what an important place information takes.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And what does it take in terms of the company's profit?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And that is why we have such a term as competitive information advantage.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
What is it?

08:42.000 --> 08:51.000
In that, who manages to build a professional team with knowledge,

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
information of our employees is our competitive advantage.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And the more qualified your employees are,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
the better they know, the better they know how to work with information,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
the more effectively your company works.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This is the first.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
The second competitive advantage, which can be,

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
it can be knowledge of geopolitical, foreign economic information,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
which affects the success of your business.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I will give such an example, that is completely real.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
The company that traded with the mineral water from Georgia,

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
in fact, after the event of such a foreign economic,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
as a break in relations between Russia and Georgia,

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
this foreign economic event influenced the fact that the company

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
practically ceased to exist.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
In principle, if the company's managers knew the information

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
that such a break could happen,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
they could take some measures, rebuild their business,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
expand the assortment line,

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
well, take some more actions to save the business.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
And the lack of such information led to the fact that

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
a tangible share of the business was lost.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
And there is another competitive advantage,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
this is the ability to better, faster than others,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
to understand, find, understand, evaluate,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
rework and put into practice this publicly available information.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
That is, we can, in principle, get additional profit

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
for better use of information.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Slide number 15.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Business information can be classified into the primary,

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
which we receive during the so-called field research marketing,

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
and the secondary is the data that we receive from internal and external sources

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
for the purposes of different research marketing.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
That is, first we conduct research,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
we get information, and all the rest of the information we get for,

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
well, again, it doesn't matter what we do it for,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
what we work with information for,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
this is the acceptance of effective management decisions.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
We have another term that, so to speak,

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
has emerged recently in connection with the increased volume of information

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
that, so to speak, is boiling in the world community,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
it is spinning, boiling, boiling over.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Information flows.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Indeed, when the information has already gained a large enough volume,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
it has already begun to pour out on us.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Information flows are the means of transmitting information

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
that ensure the existence of the social system,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
enterprises, institutions,

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
and within which the processes of transmission are moving.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
This is information for the communication,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
for the ensuring of communication of all links in the social system.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
But if we take the corporate one,

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
then this is the ensuring of coordinated interaction of all the companies' units.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Slide number 17.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
So, the result of the developed economic, legal, and organizational relations

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
that are formed within the company and the company with other companies,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
with other structures,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
is the informational support of organizations.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
This is also a very important concept,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
which, the more accurate, more effective the informational support of organizations,

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
I did not say more, but it should be enough,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
necessary and enough,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
that is, not much, not little, but exactly as much as necessary.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
This is the informational support of organizations.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Then the company can really act effectively.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Slide number 17.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
So, the informational support of organizations includes

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
informational resources of the company,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
information service,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
and the means of orientation in the market structure of business information.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Slide number 19.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
Informational support is a combination of all the resources that provide the solution of the task.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
This is monitoring, collection, processing of information, analysis,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
moderation, forecasting, and so on.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
That is, everything that we, all the resources, all the methods that we use,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
in the aggregate of all this, this is the informational support.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Slide number 20.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Here are also statistical data,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
normative and reference information,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
all kinds of classification,

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
technical and economic information.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
And the informational support is also a process of satisfying the needs of specific users in the information.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
That is, if we take it in general,

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
the informational support is a complex of measures for the creation and functioning of the information system.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Here, in the informational support, there is business documentation,

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
its system of design, storage, search, encoding.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
All this process, on the basis of which the managers make decisions,

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
which, as a result, turn into some ready-made documents.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
And the informational support has two functions.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
On the one hand, it is an economic resource of activity,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
and on the other hand, it is the result of the functioning of the market,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
business information at different levels of management.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
That is, both the resource and the result.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
On the one hand, the resource, on the other hand, the result.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
What is the role of the informational support?

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
So, we have more or less figured out all these terms,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
informational flows, informational support of the organization.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Let's deal with the tasks that the information performs.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
The information helps us to navigate in space,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
make decisions, perform various tasks,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
enjoy interesting and fascinating information,

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
maintain a cooperative relationship between partners, users, clients,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
produce high-quality informational products

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
that meet the needs of users,

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
and effectively integrate our information into the world community.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
Or, on the contrary, to use the world experience in our own activities.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
If we define who is a user, a consumer of information,

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
then we can refer to the legal references,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
everything is clearly described there.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
There is such a definition that a user of information is a subject

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
who refers to the information system for obtaining some necessary information.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
In principle, he can not only refer to the information system, but also to the intermediary.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
We can select the types of users.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
In fact, they are clearly distinguished.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
The user of information is, let's say,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
we can take different levels, the global level.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
The information is used by the global community,

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
it can be used at the level of internal political issues,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
it can be used at the level of the corporation,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
and it can be used by a physical person.

16:47.000 --> 16:58.000
In general, it is divided into legal and private users.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
In any case, these gradations can be classified.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
When we talk about information exchange,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
we have four basic elements.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
The first is the sender, who collects and generates this information and transmits it.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
The second is the message, this is the information coded with the help of some symbols.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
The information transmission channels are the means used for its transmission.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And the receiver is the person for whom all this information is intended,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
who receives it and then interprets it.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
And here the stages of the process of information transmission are highlighted.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
The first process is the birth of an idea,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
how this information appears to me,

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
maybe I have a new idea that I want to convey,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
or some message that I need to convey.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Then the second stage is the process of the transfer of information.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
In general, the word is a very common method of encoding.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
But if we take some technical means,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
there are signs and symbols, and so on.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
There are certain laws by which information is coded,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
and it is transmitted in this way.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
That is, it is coded for each communication channel.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Then the choice of communication channel, transmission.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Then there is decoding,

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
that is, when the receiver receives this information and begins to interpret it.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And the last stage is feedback.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Here you can see in more detail, slide number 28.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
The feedback is a process of decoding.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
The receiver receives the information,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
and then the receiver interprets it.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Here you can see in more detail, slide number 28.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
The receiver must imagine exactly

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
why he wants to convey this information,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
in what form.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Encoding is the transformation of an idea into a message.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
That is, the third stage is the transfer of information.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
This is the most important thing here,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
the choice of the channel.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
As I said, each channel has its own coding rules.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
Therefore, the encoding will depend on which channel we are going to transmit this information.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Decoding is exactly what the receiver received,

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
and he must decode all these symbols in his thoughts.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
That is, he should, in theory, receive the information that we sent him.

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
And the more accurate, the more primary information coincides with the information received,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
the more efficiently the communication channel was chosen,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
the more efficiently the encoding was carried out.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
And, accordingly, the last stage is feedback.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Because, as this information is lost while it is transmitted through communication channels,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
our language is very multidimensional,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
and the same word can have many meanings.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Therefore, it is very important how the receiver perceived this information,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
how much of what he had in his mind

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
corresponds to what was sent to him initially.

20:38.000 --> 20:46.000
What are the sources of information?

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
The sources of information that I will list now are, of course, only business information.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And, of course, they are not all.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
These are some of the main sources of information that we are quite common.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Because, again, if we return to the first definition of information that we have analyzed,

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
that we have five senses, and, accordingly, we receive all this information with these senses,

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
then, of course, we are constantly in this information field,

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
and we continuously receive this information, filter it, analyze it,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
starting from the information of what is happening to us inside,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
ending with some lunar and solar eclipses,

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
which we think we do not feel in any way,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
but in fact, it also affects us.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
But if we cut off all possible other channels and take only business information,

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
then, accordingly, the most common sources of information are our media,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
newspapers, magazines, books, radio, television.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
We also get a lot of information from communication with other people,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
so these are conferences, trainings, exhibitions, various professional communities.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
In fact, there are just an infinite number of sources of information,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
it is simply impossible to list them all.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
In fact, it is surprising how much information is happening in things.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Sometimes a word that is said by chance,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
gives you a push to update.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
By the way, information, if we analyze it this way,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
can also be divided into conscious and unconscious.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
We have what we perceive as relevant and not relevant,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
not updated information.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
What we perceive, what we use all the time, actively,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
is information at the level of consciousness.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
And we also have a huge layer of information that is in the unconscious.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
It is there, it is stored there.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Everything that we have ever heard, read somewhere, learned something,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
it is always there.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
But it is in such an unupdated state.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And there is literally one word that caught you,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
and suddenly you have a huge layer of information.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
Maybe it's the smell, you have another layer of information.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
Therefore, in this regard, it is simply impossible to list the sources of information,

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
because almost all, I don't even know how it is,

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
but there are really a huge number of sources of information.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
We have already talked about business.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Naturally, we cannot forget about the Internet.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Where can we go without it?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
The 34th slide.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
Naturally, now the Internet has become the most powerful resource for obtaining information.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
What can you find there?

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
What information is contained there?

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And the resources are completely limitless,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
and the question is how to use it effectively.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
And the sources of business information on the Internet are rating agencies,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
websites of various investment companies,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
websites of companies, market analysts, electronic libraries,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
websites of universities, websites of state agencies,

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
Internet shops, websites of business literature publishers,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
websites of periodic publications.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
And the most interesting source of information is spam.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
We cannot stand it at all, we do not like it, we clean it all the time.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
In fact, it is such an unstructured, but sometimes very important information.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
Sometimes you get some things as spam that you would never look for yourself.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
But here it came and suddenly it became relevant to you.

24:39.000 --> 24:47.000
So, those who use spam are basically guided by it.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
The 35th slide.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
We have clearly highlighted three categories.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
State organizations, commercial structures and individuals.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
These are the categories that consumers use information.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Slide number 36.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
So, if we analyze the types of information,

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
we will go from the most general to the most private.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
The most important information is the global one,

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
which is the property of all people in this world.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
But, of course, it is quite dosed for each person.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Next, the internal political information.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
This is information that concerns the life of our country.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
Here we have a huge number of news that are constantly reported to us on the radio and TV.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
There is also market information.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
This is information that concerns the market in which a particular company interacts.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
For example, the black metal market.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
If a company deals in metals.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Or the household appliances market.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
If a company deals in household appliances, and so on.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
This is a specialized market where the company is an active subject.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Next, corporate information.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
This is information within the company.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
This is internal information for the company.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
And the colloquial information.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It can be called personal.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
This is the unofficial information.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
It is the information that is used to spread rumors and gossip.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
These are the types that are important.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
You can also add personal information that each of us has about himself.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
But we will not talk about personal information, because it is not business.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
But colloquial information is business.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Why? Because it affects the efficiency of the company.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Therefore, we will consider it.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Inside the corporate information streams.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
They can be horizontal.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
This is the colloquial information that we talked about.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
And we will return to it.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
And vertical.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Which can be descending from the management to the employees.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And ascending from the employees to the management.

27:23.000 --> 27:30.000
What is the difference between colloquial and horizontal information?

27:30.000 --> 27:39.000
The corporate information streams are more effective in the course of communication.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Therefore, we will not touch them today.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
And we will touch the colloquial information.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
Because this is the information that is horizontal.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
It must exist in any company.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Whether we want it or not.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
And on the other hand, it can play a big role in the efficiency of the company.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
What is this information?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
This is information about all kinds of incidents.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
About all kinds of misuse, violations, disciplinary actions.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Stealing in extreme manifestations.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
About some personal serious problems of employees.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Which prevent them from effectively performing their work.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
About some unethical actions.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
About conflicts, intrigues.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
About the level of information from employees.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
This is also very important information.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Because the question is.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
If a person does not have official information.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
Then he will definitely fill this gap with some unofficial information.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Moreover, this unofficial information will be emotionally offensive.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
And will grow like a snowflake.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Therefore, nature does not tolerate emptiness.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Everything that concerns information is also applicable to this law.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Where there is no official information, a colloquial one appears.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
About the presence of informal leaders.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Whose goals are in line with the company's goals.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
About the dissatisfaction of the staff.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
If the dissatisfaction is still small.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
We can work with him.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Take psychological measures.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
But if we do not collect this information.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Then this process may be irreversible.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
In the sense that we cannot guide them.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And about the true attitude of the employees.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
To one or another phenomenon in the company.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
All this information needs to be collected.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But generally speaking.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
This is the responsibility zone of the staff management.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
They must collect this information.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Analyze, sift it.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
And issue ready-made recommendations.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
Because if...

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
For example, keep your hand on your pulse.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
If there are some displeasures.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
It is always easier to lead the process.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
And to lead it in the right direction.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Than to deal with the consequences.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
With conflicts, with some incidents.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
With some violations.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
The tasks that solve the collection of such information.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Slide number 39.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
These are the tasks that are solved by the method of collecting colloquial information.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
This is a reduction of risks of adverse situations.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
This is a forecast of the behavior of the employees in the team.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
This is monitoring of some resistance.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
To the changes that are made.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
This is loyalty management.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
This is preventing conflicts.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
This is a reduction of risks of intentional damage.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
It is also very important here that this is the destruction of the circle of failure.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
Because it often undermines the efficiency of the organization.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
Preventing all kinds of criminal agreements.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
With clients, with partners.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
In order to obtain personal benefits.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Accordingly, this is a declaration of openness of the company itself.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
This is the creation and promotion of legends.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Which we need to create a corporate spirit.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
These are the tasks we solve.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Slide number 40.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
When we collect this information, we must clearly maintain the principle of receiving feedback.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
This is necessarily anonymity.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
If we collect information, we collect it in principle.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
We do not need authors.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Who said that?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
It is important for us to collect this array and analyze it.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
It is not important for us to punish for this information.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
For example, Petya, Vasya or someone else.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And in order for you to be given real feedback.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
You need to clearly maintain the principle of anonymity.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Only those people need to pass on the received information.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Who need it for decisions.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
And strictly adhere to the principle of confidentiality of information.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Information can be collected only in live communication.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The survey is conducted, of course.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
But again, the percentage of truthfulness of this information.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
When we do it by survey.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It is always questioned.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But if we communicate.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Then here, of course, you can already get more reliable information.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Employees who collect this information.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
They must have a good level of professionalism.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
In order to be able to talk to a person.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
And you really get reliable information from him.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Not the one you want.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
And the last thing.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
That there must be a competent processing of the information.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
And, accordingly, to evaluate its objectivity competently.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Slide number 41.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Now we move on to the types of information.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
This classification by type is very conditional.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
But in order not to get confused with you.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
I introduce different classifications of information.

33:12.000 --> 33:19.000
And so we have to introduce such a term as a type of information.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
It can be divided, again, by the level of importance for the organization.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Purposefully distributed information.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
This is the information that any organization distributes about itself.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
With the help of PR, marketing, advertising.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
This is the information that we purposefully let into the world.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And what we want it to know.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
The next information is generally accessible.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
This is the information that...

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
By the way, purposefully distributed is all the information that our company contains on the Internet.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
That is, all kinds of sites.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
The next level of information is generally accessible.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
This is the information that we, on the one hand, seem to adhere to it.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
And we don't want to spread it purposefully.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
But we know for sure that people who are interested in our company know it for sure.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
For example, any company knows a lot about its competitors.

34:34.000 --> 34:46.000
This is the information that is distributed on the market among your competitors, partners, clients, and so on.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
This is the information that we would like to hide, on the one hand.

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
But it still seeps into those people who are interested in its collection.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
This is the generally accessible information.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And, accordingly, there is also confidential information.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
This information is mutually acute.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
On the one hand, it is an effective weapon.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
On the other hand, it is our weak spot.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
When we receive some information, we arm ourselves.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
And when someone receives some information about us, he weakens our position.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
Because this is our weak spot, our confidential information.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
This is the information that we will carefully hide.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
The information that we will take care of.

35:39.000 --> 35:47.000
This is a very expensive task to keep confidential information.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
What kind of information can be confidential?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Slide 42.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
We will talk only about the confidential information.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.000
Because everything is clear about the generally accessible and purposeful information.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
But let's talk about the confidential information in more detail.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
What kind of information is confidential?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
This is all commercial information.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
This is all production information.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
Some know-how that allows you to earn money.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
Which allows you to trade in the market or in some segment of the market.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Or in some product in a separate one.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
And organizational and management information.

36:28.000 --> 36:35.000
Confidential information can be divided into three large blocks.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
Commercial information is the most production information.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It is clear that this is know-how of production.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
Organizational and management information is also very clear.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
This is all that concerns our business processes, our organization.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Therefore, let's talk about commercial information.

36:53.000 --> 37:00.000
But here I want to make a philosophical digression.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Very often this happens in companies.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I have encountered this more than once.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
And it always makes me smile.

37:09.000 --> 37:19.000
When a company starts to present a large amount of information as confidential information,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
you have no right to…

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
And it is especially funny when you call someone and ask,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
what is the name of the head of the department?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And he says, this is confidential information.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But this is actually very funny.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
Because then you open the website and everything is told there.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
This is always a mismatch.

37:39.000 --> 37:46.000
When you tell your employees that all the information they receive at work is confidential,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and they, God forbid, say something to someone,

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
and they also sign a document that they have no right to disseminate this information.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And when we open the company's website, everything is written there.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
Everything, starting from the employees and owners of this company,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
ending with the company's turnover and the planned turnover for the next year.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
So, there are two questions here.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Either the information you have on the website is not reliable,

38:13.000 --> 38:21.000
and then it is clear why it exists there.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
Or, in general, there should be a ratio.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
All the information on the website is already purposefully distributed.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
And making it confidential is at least funny.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
And at most, it is stupid.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
Especially when the employees receive signatures.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
It is clear that the confidential information should be preserved.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
This is not yours, but a weak point of any company.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
But we must clearly approach what kind of information is confidential.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Because we will hide it.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
We will spend money and resources on it.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
Therefore, it makes sense to clearly determine for yourself what kind of information is confidential.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Let's figure it out.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
What kind of commercial information can be confidential?

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
In fact, not all of the listed information here will be confidential for each company.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Each company chooses for itself.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
You can choose some of the listed information,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
which will be really confidential for you.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
And you will need to keep it a secret.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
But this is knowledge and experience in the field of product and service implementation.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Our employees are the carriers of this information.

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
That's why we come back to the fact that there are no irreplaceable people,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
but each employee is valuable.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
Because when leaving, he takes away some of the information,

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
which is really confidential to some extent,

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
and in some cases is completely confidential.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Information and market conjecture, marketing research,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
analysis of competitiveness of products and services,

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
information about consumers, customers, intermediaries,

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
banking and all kinds of relations, loans, debts, and so on.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
This information is, of course, confidential.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Because it is clear that if a company has a lot of debts,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
the degree of trust for it will sharply decrease.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And so on.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
We need clients who trust us.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
Knowledge of the most profitable forms of using securities,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
all kinds of capital investments.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
It is also clear that this is confidential information.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Accounting financial reports, salary information.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
The salary information is also a subtle point.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
It was especially relevant several years ago,

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
when all our salaries were in envelopes.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
Companies tried to make sure that employees did not know each other's salaries.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
In fact, this is almost impossible, because there is always a leak.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
And we do not have the means to stop this leak.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Still, employees will know each other's salaries.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
One way or another.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Assumed volumes of commercial activity,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
materials of contracts,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
list of clients and business correspondence.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Prices, estimates, forms and types of payments.

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
It is clear that this information is very difficult to keep as confidential.

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
It is more likely to be publicly available.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
We also have one classification of information,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
which we can also introduce.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
I called it the information design.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
The information can be structured or systematized,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
and unstructured or unsystematized.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Let's see.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
I showed you some ways to structure information.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
There are many more.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
The main ones are diagrams, models, graphs, tables, slides, statistics,

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
technical characteristics, list of rights, analytical notes, expertise.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
This list can be continued.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Why?

42:25.000 --> 42:31.000
Because when we want to make a decision based on information,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
we must structure it.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It is clear.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Until we structure the information,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
we will not be able to work with it.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
It will become functional only when it is assigned, structured,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
and then it becomes a tool.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
But unstructured information.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
These are all kinds of texts, discussions, chats, news.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It can be continued.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
When we start to gather information,

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
it is unstructured information that requires reworking

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
and creating a structure.

43:09.000 --> 43:17.000
What is the process of creation of information?

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Since information is a formal knowledge,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
another definition,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I liked it,

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
the process of creation of information is

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
the transformation of a single unproven knowledge

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
into a manifested knowledge,

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
into something that we can somehow fix.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
And where do we fix this information?

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
Most often we fix any information in documents.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
A document is a legal document

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
that serves as a written proof of a phenomenon.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
Any object that fixes information,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
any knowledge,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
can be preserved.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
This is a very important function of a document,

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
that it is preserved and can be referred to again.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
Basically, information can be fixed

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
both verbally and inverbally,

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
with some icons, tables, symbols, and so on.

44:24.000 --> 44:32.000
It is clear that now all ideas are the carriers of this information,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
discs, cassettes,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
all kinds of things,

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
no matter how we write it down now.

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
All technical means are developing rapidly

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
precisely because there is a lot of information,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and we need carriers of information

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
that can be less and less in volume,

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
but more and more information is being recorded.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
In fact, this is the trend,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
the development of all technical means.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Less volume, more information.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I think that to some extent

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
all this will develop

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
and in the end we will get a pill

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
that will record all the information from the Internet.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
By the way, this is also a recent trend,

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
that in addition to the fact that we need more and more information

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
on a smaller carrier,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
we also need access to information.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
The faster, the more effective.

45:39.000 --> 45:45.000
These services will develop

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
and will be in high demand.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
To get information quickly and effectively,

45:51.000 --> 46:00.000
and to transfer it with the smallest physical volume.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Slide 48.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Forms of documents.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Documents can be designed as text,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
for example, books, magazines, manuscripts,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
as graphic and illustrative drawings,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
diagrams, plans, diagrams,

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
audiovisual recordings,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
movies, diapositives.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
I have already said that

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
technical means of recording information

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
are developing and will continue to develop.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
Let's move on to the information problems

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and ways of solving them.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Slide 49.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
So, we talked about interference.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
I said that at each stage of information transfer

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
we have a loss of credibility.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
We started with the fact that when we encode information,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
we lose a piece of it,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
because we need to cover the information

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
in some words, symbols or something else.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
And we don't always do it effectively,

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
that is, to the full extent.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
What we want to convey,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
we can convey to a certain extent of credibility.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Someone better, for example,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
uses the word cat, more vocabulary,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
those are more credible in transferring information.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
If a person does not have a very large vocabulary,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
or does not know some terms,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
naturally, he will do worse.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Next, there is a transfer of information

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
through communication channels.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Each communication channel has its own rules

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
by which we can encode this information.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And again, there is a moment

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
that if I know these rules well,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
I know well, I will lose less credibility of information.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
If I don't know the rules very well,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
I can lose this information at this stage.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Next, there is decoding of information.

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
Again, a person begins to decode information

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
by passing it through his own filters.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
And the filters start from the settings

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
and end with some purely physical effects on him.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
If, for example, he does it in a calm environment,

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
then he perceives the information more reliably.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
If his emotional level is higher,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
then it is also a filter.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
There are a lot of filters here,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
but they are mostly understood in the course of communication,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
effective communication.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
There is more information about filters.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
The thing is that there is a difference between noise and interference.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
It is present at every stage of information processing.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
Since we are talking about the topic of information processing technology,

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
we will be the addressees.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
We are the ones who receive information.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
How to make our work with information more effective?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Slide 50.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
So, we will not talk about the single information we receive

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
and its effectiveness.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
We can talk about information flows.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Why?

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
Because the big problem of modernity

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
is the huge amount of information.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
A huge amount of information is being thrown at us.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I want to make a lyrical digression.

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
We can classify information in this way.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
We can classify it in a negative and positive way.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
This is very clearly highlighted in modern society.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It becomes a big problem.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Why?

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
Because a person has a threshold of sensitivity.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Any of us has it.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
When too much negative information comes through this threshold,

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
we cannot cope with it psychologically.

49:51.000 --> 50:00.000
This negative information starts to affect us negatively.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
We get a lot of stress from it.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
In modern society, when there are big disadvantages,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
there are big advantages.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
And vice versa.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
When there are big advantages, there are always big limitations.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
I have already said that information is a powerful weapon.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
On the other hand, it is a weak point of any person.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
If there is a lot of information about me,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I do not know how to control it.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
How to control this process?

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
The same is true of the amount of information we receive from outside.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
On the one hand, this is a great benefit,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
because it allows us to navigate in time and space,

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
to make effective decisions,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
because we receive the right amount of information.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
On the other hand, information affects us.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
If we receive negative information,

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
it affects us in a destructive way.

50:54.000 --> 51:01.000
It drives us into stress.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
The amount of information that we receive is very stressful.

51:05.000 --> 51:14.000
The human brain has the ultimate ability to digest information.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
Psychologists recommend one thing.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
To protect yourself from negative information.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
Do not listen to the radio, do not watch TV,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
do not read the newspaper before lunch.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Do you remember the story of the dog's heart?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Do not read the Soviet newspapers before lunch.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
And there are no other newspapers.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
So, do not read the newspaper at all.

51:36.000 --> 51:45.000
Studies have shown that students in England

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
were affected by the amount of negative information

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
that we receive every day from the news.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
They really got sick from this information.

51:54.000 --> 52:00.000
Therefore, the importance of information is now very...

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
By the way, we do not notice this.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
The biggest drawback is that we do not notice it.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
For us, this huge flow of information,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
which we pass through ourselves all the time,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
is a norm.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
We work with it.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
We are forced to receive a lot of information

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
in order to make effective decisions.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
But we do not realize that this is a really stress-generating factor.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
And if there is an opportunity,

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
it is better to dose the flow of information

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
that comes to you from the outside

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and which you have to process.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
But this is a lyrical retreat.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
Unfortunately, we will not get rid of negative information at all.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
But we must understand that positive information

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
is much more important for us than negative.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
We must try to compensate for the negative with positive.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
So, let's get back to our business life,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
to our modern information flows.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
There are several phenomena of modern information flows.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
In particular, progress in the field of information production

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
leads to a decrease in the general level of information.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
And it generates new types of network services.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
What does this mean?

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
Look, there is a lot of information.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
The growth is rapid and sharp.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
But we have less information.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Why?

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Because our body is protected.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
We have more filters.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
We just let some information pass by our ears

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and do not react to it in any way.

53:44.000 --> 53:50.000
And by the way, at this moment we can miss some very important information.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
Such an disproportionate growth of unstructured information

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
leads to its poor structuring.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
What is unstructured information?

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
This is information that cannot be a tool.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
It cannot be.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It needs to be structured.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
It is necessary to spend a large amount of effort

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
to structure this unstructured information.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
A lot of parasite information appears.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
We do not need it at all.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
But we let it in and process it.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
And it is an obstacle for us.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Next.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
Disagreement with the formal information is a real necessity.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
But to choose what we really need from this sea of information

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
is also a separate job that requires resources.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
And there is also duplication of information.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
The same message is published in different places.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
But we need to open it and see.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I have already read it.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
It is also a waste of time and resources.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
This is the first phenomenon.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Slide number 51.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
The second phenomenon.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
New network services, sometimes with a thousand times less sources,

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
solve the problem of consumers much more effectively.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Why?

55:14.000 --> 55:23.000
Large network search systems have come to the conclusion

55:23.000 --> 55:30.000
that network integration of news is necessary.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
They have concluded agreements with the largest information agencies

55:34.000 --> 55:41.000
and began to provide news information to these agencies online.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
You do not need to buy newspapers.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
You can open the Internet and read all the news.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
But what happens here?

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
On the one hand, it seems to be a plus.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
And on the other hand, it turns out to be a one-sided coverage of news.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And here you need to choose all the time

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
between the reliability of the information,

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
its objectivity and its volume.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
It is proportional.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
The less we cover the sources, the more subjectivity increases.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The next phenomenon.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Slide number 52.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
The existing today mechanism of news integration

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
is effective only when there is an information service within the company.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
What is this phenomenon?

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
This is a phenomenon that there is a lot of information.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
In order to get reliable, verified,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
analytically structured information,

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
we need a service in the company that will do this.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
We need employees who will sit and

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
from this huge stream of information

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
to make the necessary decision for us.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Because here, again,

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
we have this ratio of volume of information

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
and level of reliability.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
When we talk about unstructured information,

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
if we reduce the volume,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
we will suffer from unreliability.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
Again, like any way out of any situation,

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
here the way out is only in the optimal combination of volume and reliability.

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
It makes sense not to read the sources nearby,

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
but to read the sources that take the opposite positions.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Then this picture may be more objective.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
The next phenomenon.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
The popular content analysis today does not have a definite interpretation.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
What does this mean for us?

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
The concept of content analysis came from psychology.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
And sociology still does not have a definite definition,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
it is not formalized.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
Therefore, everyone talks about their own content analysis.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
Someone in this concept invests completely different mechanisms, different methods.

58:13.000 --> 58:21.000
Accordingly, one content analysis will not be connected with another.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Every time we will have to invent a bicycle.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
Because there is still no single understanding of what a single mechanism is.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
So, what can we do?

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
What are the effective technologies of work

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
with a growing flow of unstructured text information?

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
When we talk about searching for information on the Internet

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
with large information arrays,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
we have two criteria.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
The first criterion is the size of the database,

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
the number of sites it attracted.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
And, accordingly, the larger the database,

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
the more sites the search engine knows.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And the more accurate the search.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
And the second criterion is the information of the given links.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
That is, not only to attract many sites,

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
but also the information contained in these links should be useful to you.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
So, what are the main criteria we should consider

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
when we search and sort documents from sites?

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
First, the number of searchable words in the text,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
the distance between these words in the text,

59:30.000 --> 59:35.000
the place in the text where these words are found in the title, in the text itself,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
the appearance of the font used,

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
and the number of links from the Internet to this document.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
These are the criteria that will help us sort documents.

59:53.000 --> 59:59.000
When we talk about who needs information in the company,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
it is difficult to select an employee

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
who would never use some external, unstructured information.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I think that every employee,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
well, we will not take such service staff as a cleaner,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
we take the manager's position and higher,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
then, of course, all these positions use unstructured information from the Internet

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
for their goals, for making their decisions,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
for analyzing the existing situation, and so on.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But here are some examples of such specialists.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
For security services, it is especially relevant

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
to analyze the reliability of new partners and the environment,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
monitoring the state of permanent partners and their projects,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
assessment and forecast of the company's development,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
risk assessment and forecast.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Here is a very important remark.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Why is it important for security services to be able to use all this unstructured information?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Because, as you know, about 30% of confidential and about 10% of very confidential,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
completely secret information is contained in open sources.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
As an example, we can cite the book by Viktor Suvorov,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
which described the peculiarities of Stalin's policy,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
based only on newspaper sources.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
He specifically wrote in the preface that he did not use any secret document,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
he used only the information that was written in Soviet newspapers.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And based on this, he made his conclusions.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Here you can argue about the legitimacy of these conclusions or not,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000
but the fact is that this book is a very good illustration,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000
a confirmation that completely secret information is also contained in open sources.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Therefore, it is very important for your security service to be able to work with information,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
to be able to predict, analyze, to identify the main thing

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and pay attention to the nuances that will help to predict events with the greatest probability.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Who else is it important for?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I will repeat that it is important for everyone to work with information.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Here is an example for the department of strategic planning and management.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is important to analyze the activities of the enterprise, macroeconomic analysis,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and the predicted state of the country.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It is very important here, because, as we did not want,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
but all internal political events, even external political events,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
they sometimes have a great impact on the life of the company,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and its survivability in certain conditions.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And since competent analysts who deal with strategic management,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
they must, based on the information they receive, build forecasts,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
this is their main function,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
then they must understand the tendencies of development in the geopolitical situation,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and how it can affect the life of a particular company.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Next, analysis of the market segment, monitoring of competitors is an important tool.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Expansion and diversification of business influence,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
development of optimal marketing and business strategies.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
This is the information, unstructured stream of information,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
which they receive from all sorts of sources, will allow them to solve such tasks.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So, now we have come to the topic of the main information problems

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
that are facing the heads of Russian enterprises today.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Of course, now there is such a stage in the development of our Russian business,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000
when the companies that have survived are forced to pay attention to themselves,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and are forced to establish their business processes.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And when we talk about business processes,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
there is also an effective work with information.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
What is a business process?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It is just the building of channels, effective transmission of information,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and, accordingly, obtaining and processing of external information.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
This is also very important, because such a stage has come,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
that companies have grown up, enlarged, and it is necessary to postpone all these processes.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Unpostponability and coordination of business processes

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
greatly affects the efficiency of management.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Now, in companies, in many companies,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
these business processes are formed spontaneously,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
unconsciously and uncontrollably.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And now, for many companies, the moment has come

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
when all this needs to be organized, structured,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
so that the management can really manage the information flows

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
both inside and outside the company.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Therefore, the lack of coordination and coordination of business processes

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
are big informational problems for enterprises.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
The second problem is the inability to obtain timely,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
sufficiently argumented information to make a management decision.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
This problem has been and will be.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Because, of course, we have three criteria.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The first is timeliness, quality and completeness.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
This also applies to information.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
We need to get quality information, that is, reliable.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
The quality of information is determined by reliability.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
We need volume.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Remember, I said that the volume of information should be sufficient.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
There should be neither more nor less information,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
but exactly enough.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And, accordingly, timeliness.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
That is, the information is needed at the moment when it is needed,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
not a minute later.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Because you need to make the appropriate decision.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And therefore, this problem is actually being fought over.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
How to organize this whole process,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
all these information flows,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
so that they are really of the right quality,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
in the right volume and at the right time.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The next problem is the lack or insufficient effectiveness

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
of horizontal connections between units,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
subsidiary structures and branches.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
This is also understandable.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
This is also a problem when we have,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
as soon as we have these information flows

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
between units, branches, subsidiary structures,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
the coordination of their work is immediately violated,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and, accordingly, the effectiveness of making and implementing

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
management decisions.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Fourth.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The lack of a single monitoring system of the enterprise's activities.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This is a problem for many enterprises.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Even when there is a marketing department,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
it seems to monitor the enterprise's activities.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
But here it is very important to have a single system

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and to have very well-developed criteria.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
But for many enterprises this is a problem.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And the ineffectiveness of using the received information,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
the mass of this information that is accumulated in all companies.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The difficulty of access to archives, for example,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
is also a big problem for many enterprises,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
when there is no way to quickly, effectively and quickly

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
get the necessary information about past actions.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
This is also a big problem for many enterprises.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Slide 60.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
The lack of reliability and compliance with business processes

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and the related management problems.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Competition has grown on one side,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
there are not enough coercive personnel on the other side,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
and the company solved its problems as they were.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
As business developed, they solved it as best they could,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
without paying attention to the correctness of business processes.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And now it is time to use the information resource as it should be.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And this is very often the reorganization of the company's business.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
For many companies this is a stumbling block

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and a narrow place that slows down the further development of the business.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The inability to get sufficient argumentative information

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
for making financial decisions.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
It is a very difficult task to solve without using any information systems.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But if this is introduced,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
full control over all business processes in the company,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
over all information processes in the company,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
then this will also play a role in increasing efficiency.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But what is important here?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The lack of horizontal connections between subsidiaries, subsidiary companies and branches.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It is very important that the information does not lose its reliability.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Because when information from different sources or from one source

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
comes to the other, excluding each other,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
it is very difficult to navigate in this flow.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
The information should be well-established here.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The channel of information should be very well established.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Both direct information and feedback.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And the less reliability is lost here,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
the more effective the whole company will work.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The lack of a single system of constant monitoring.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
What is here?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The object of monitoring should be such moments as finances,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
our financial flow should be constantly monitored,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
where the money comes from,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
what resources and who is in charge.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Further, the system of purchases and sales, production,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
the results of the activities of individual employees or branches.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Those companies that control these processes,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
they have their advantages.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
First, budgeting is more competently arranged,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
production volumes are regulated,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
there is no overproduction,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
warehouses are more effectively used, and so on.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
The system of constant monitoring is also one of the resources

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
for increasing the efficiency of the enterprise.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Inefficiency is used on accumulated information.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
This is often found in situations

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000
when information comes either not in time or not reliably.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And very often there is also that in companies,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
that there is no single client base.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Now there are fewer and fewer such companies.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But it is very important when we have an archive of our relations with clients.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And we can track the whole history of relations.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
When we do not have such information,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
it also affects the efficiency of the business.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
What methods do we have to somehow deal with

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
this huge volume of unstructured information?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Slide number 65 is the content analysis method.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
This is exactly the method that allows us

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
to work most effectively with our information flows,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and unstructured information.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I have already said that when we talked about the phenomenon

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
of modern states,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I said that the content analysis method is not yet formalized,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
not yet defined, so it has a lot of definitions.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
On the one hand, this is a method of objective,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
qualitative systematic study of the content of the means of communication.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
On the other hand, this is a systematic numerical processing,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
assessment and interpretation of the form and content of the information source.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
On the third hand, this is a qualitative number of methods of working with documents

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that are characterized by the effectiveness of conclusions and the strictness of the procedure.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
And the next thing is that this is a research technique

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
for obtaining results by analyzing the content of the text,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and the state and properties of social reality.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That is, there are a lot of definitions.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
But in any case, the content analysis method

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
consists of finding certain substantive concepts in the text,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
which are the units of analysis,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and identifying the frequency of meeting

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
in accordance with the content of the entire document.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
That is, we look for how many times a particular word is found in this text

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and compare it with the content of the entire document.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The content analysis method can be quantitative and qualitative.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
The quantity of content analysis is the frequency of appearance in documents

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
of certain characteristics of content.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Three stages of this content analysis are highlighted.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
First, the units of analysis are highlighted

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and translated into the type acceptable for processing.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Of course, now it's all done electronically.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That is, it is very important for us to highlight the criteria for the units of analysis.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
What will we have, on what basis will we analyze the document.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Next, the second stage is the calculation of the frequency of the units of analysis

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
using various mathematical devices

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
to identify the interconnection between them.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
What do we do?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Here we already apply mathematical formulas and process them mathematically.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Now it's all done on computers.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We process and get certain quantitative conclusions.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
The third stage is the interpretation of the results.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
That is, this is what we will work with.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So, the stages of qualitative content analysis.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
They are about the same as quantitative.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
We are not looking at statistical data, but at the content.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
The first stage is the combination of a large amount of text information

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
with the final number of integrated blocks of text units,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
which will be processed in the future.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That is, we also highlight this very unit of analysis.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Then we also look at the interconnection between these units in the text.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Then we form conclusions in communication, compare.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
This is also the third stage of the interpretation of information.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Now, in addition to content analysis, the next step,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
the next stage of content analysis is the content monitoring of information flows.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Here they try to combine both qualitative and quantitative.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It turns out that content monitoring is a substantive analysis of information flows

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
in order to obtain the necessary qualitative and quantitative segments,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
which are constantly produced over a certain and finite period of time.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Monitoring is clear.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
We do content analysis more than once, but we do it constantly.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
We monitor, compare with previous results

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and thus build some trends.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
What else can we see in the modern stage of our business development

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and information applied to business?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The situation of rapid growth in the pace of information production has caused a number of problems.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
The first problem is the disproportionate growth of information noise

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
due to the weak structure of information.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000
This has caused a lot of unnecessary information,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
a lot of interference.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
When we look for the right information,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
we are like a person who washes gold.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
We start to wash the empty rock

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and look for the grains of this gold information for ourselves.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
There is a lot of noise that we have to overcome.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The second difficulty is the emergence of parasitic information.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
The third difficulty is the lack of formal information

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
that is really in demand from consumers.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
There is information,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
we have typed the word that interests us,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and we get a lot of formal information,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
which is not formally useful.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And, accordingly, the duplication of information.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It is a reprint of the same information in different publications.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
In order to deal with this phenomenon,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.000
people who provide information streams

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
have invented thematic navigators.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
They allow you to move around related thematic categories,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and each of them can include a large number of documents

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
close to the content.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
The best of these navigators allows you to find a whole range of topics

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
that are relevant to the documents you are interested in,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and then move around the topics.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
That is, the navigators are not only looking for one topic,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
but they are looking for the words you have stated in different topics,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
in different thematic blocks.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That is, the machine thinks practically for a person.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
It thinks about what topics can be close,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
nearby, where we can also find the information we need.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So far, there are two categories of thematic navigators.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
The first category has a rigid structure.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And here the hierarchy of categories is used,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
which reflects the general system of existing knowledge of the reeds.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Here it is very rigid.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
We have introduced one word, a very rigid hierarchical structure,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
which gives us information.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
The second category of navigators is created specifically,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
it is very flexible, but at the same time it is very expensive,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
because it is created exclusively

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
for a certain subject area.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
This is number 73.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So, we talked about the ways

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
of detecting this information,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
unstructured,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
how we can, where we can find it,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
that is, how we can provide for ourselves

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
this incoming stream of information

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
in order to further structure it.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And the last topic we will discuss today

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
is how an analytical note is prepared.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It turns out that we found where to get this information,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
we provided ourselves with this stream,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and then, in the end, we need this information

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
not just to have it,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
we need it for purely practical purposes,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
so that we can use this information

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
to make decisions.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Therefore, as a rule,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
if we are really engaged in some kind of

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
systematization of information,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
in the search for some information we need,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
then all this is poured into an analytical note.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Otherwise, it is pointless.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
If we do not do this,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
if we do not record this information,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
our work that we have done,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
if we do not record it on paper in the form of documents,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
then this work turns out to be pointless.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
As a rule, such a search ends up with a certain review,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
for example, an analytical note.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
There are stages of work

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
that allow us to do this effectively.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
The first is the search.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
We must, conditionally speaking,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
collect this amount of information,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
which we will then systematize and structure.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I must say, to be honest,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
any topics, any training,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
they are prepared according to this scheme.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We do not get an analytical note,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
but we get some kind of training program.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But the scheme is the same,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
because it is very similar to

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
some scientific research.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
On the other hand,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
if we use an analytical device,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
any analytical note,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
in terms of structure, content and labor costs,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
is very similar to some scientific work.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
The only thing is that there is no practical part,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
because it is a theoretical information analysis.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So, what are the stages?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The first stage is the search.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Naturally, we first look for it,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
then we select it,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
then we analyze what we found and collected,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
then we systematize it,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
and then we get the structure,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
more or less logical structure,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and after that we prepare the reference.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
At the search stage, what do we do?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Our task is to correctly identify the sources of information.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
This is a very important point,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
where we will get the information.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Next, we select the invoice.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
What is an invoice?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
An invoice is a fact.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
What is very important here?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It is important that we rely on facts,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and facts are called the objective reality,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
which already exists,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
which cannot be refuted.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Why?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Because there is a assumption in opposition to facts.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
We have assumptions and facts.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
We assume that an event can occur in one way or another.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And the fact is already a real action,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
an event that has already happened.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Therefore, we can only rely on facts.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Assumptions require verification by facts.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Facts are divided into empirical,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
which are extracted directly from the experiment,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
into scientific,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
which are obtained by means of objective data,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
into departmental,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
which are composed of various institutions and institutions.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
There are also statistical facts.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
These are the ones that describe,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
or rather summarize,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
many, many, many different events that have already happened.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And, of course, from this category of facts,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
the most reliable are statistical facts.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Because they are...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Although, if we take into account what statistics we have,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
in theory, the most reliable should be statistical data.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Or empirical data, too.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Why? Because empirical data is something that is extracted directly from the experiment.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
But we should understand that any scientific facts,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
all of them have...

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
When someone exposes them,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
he still brings his subjective opinion,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
subjective perspective.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
He looks at these facts from his point of view,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and he exposes them from his position,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
based on his system of values.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It is clear that

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
we have a multifaceted phenomenon,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and we can describe the same phenomenon in a completely different way.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And from different points of view,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.000
and from different emotional components.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But here comes to mind the anecdote about the elephant.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
When three blind people were led to the elephant,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
one touched the leg,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
the other the tail,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
and when they started to discuss what an elephant is,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
one said that an elephant is a big pole,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
the third said that it is a small cord,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
and the fourth said that it is a...

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
well, a rump, right?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And they were all right on the one hand,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and wrong on the other,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
because an elephant is something more holistic.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
The same thing happens with our facts.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
In any case,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
we need to understand that

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
we need to make corrections to subjectivity

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
when we work with facts.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
In any case, facts are an objective reality for us.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
The next one is selection.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
When we talk about selection,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
we should keep the framework of our task.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The information we receive should correspond to the interests and levels of preparation of the user.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
What does it mean?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It means that each of us,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
due to our preparation,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
can perceive or not perceive a particular piece of information.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
In general, if a person has never been engaged in programming,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
then everything that concerns the computer,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
he will perceive at the same level.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And if he starts reporting something at the professional level,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
he will not understand anything

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and will not be able to make any decisions based on this information.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Therefore, when we say that

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
a certain category of consumers will read this analytical note,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
we should focus on how they will be able to understand it.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
It is very important, of course,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
when we talk about selection,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
to set priorities.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It is very important to select the main thing,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
what will really affect the decision-making.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And the facts are thrown out gradually.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Facts are filtered by a selective method.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
The unnecessary is thrown away, and the useful is left.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Only the information that contributes to the solution of the tasks is valuable.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Then the filtered material is grouped and systematized.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
This is where the selection stage ends.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
We come to the understanding of the material.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
The first thing we do is to make a draft version.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
We write, write, write, write,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
until we can do nothing, we do not question anything.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
We just put it out.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
We put out a stream of consciousness,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
so as not to interfere with our associative series.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Because this associative series can lead us to some original, non-standard solution.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Then the next stage is the preliminary version of the final document,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000
already with compliance with all the requirements

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
that are defined for such a type of document.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Then, at the stage of systematization of the original information,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
we must have a clearly formulated goal.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Why are we doing this at all?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
And to compare it with this goal.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
To compare all the illustrations, all the examples,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and use arguments.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Arguments can be based only on facts.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
We provide arguments and illustrations when we systematize our information.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
We provide arguments based on facts, which are already generally recognized.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And here it is very important not to overdo it with arguments.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
That is, to use them exactly to prove your idea.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Slide 78.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And then we develop a behavior algorithm.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Here we just draw up our document,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
because direct dependence on the adoption of a timely and qualitative solution

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
depends on the clarity and readability of our document.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
How the information is presented.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
The information must be presented in a business style.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000
A business style is a logical, linguistic structure.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It is an external, devoid of emotional, expressive color.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000
That is, the basis of a business style is a book-and-letter vocabulary,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
which is widely used in ready-made language formulas and terms.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Why?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Because the use of terms, when they are designed for a prepared reader,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
greatly reduces the time, because we know the terms in the formulation,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
and we can talk about everything in one language.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Next, after the document is compiled, we must edit it

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
so that it is really a ready-made document.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Since we put a signature under it, we must know what we sign for,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
we must first edit it.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
First, we read the text in one breath from A to Z

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
in order to understand the overall impression of the document.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Then we read and see how the linguistic and stylistic structure

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
corresponds to the business style.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Then we begin to shorten, eliminate general places, lengths,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
not very successful examples, unnecessary arguments.
