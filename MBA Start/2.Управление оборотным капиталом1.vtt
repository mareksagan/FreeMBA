00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
And we are moving to the next question, a very important question of our lecture, the question of managing turnover.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
If we have been talking about what is turnover capital of an enterprise,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
that is, we have defined it, indicating its importance for an enterprise,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
now comes the moment of how to manage this capital, how to manage it correctly,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
not to let it go to the dumps, so that the enterprise feels very good.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
And now we come to the second, but the most important question of our lecture.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
The practice says that it is possible to choose three types of various policies of managing turnover capital.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
Aggressive, conservative and moderate centrist policy.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Aggressive policy.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
An enterprise that has an aggressive policy of managing its capital is called a fat cat.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Why? What is aggressive policy?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Aggressive policy implies no restrictions in the growth of current assets.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
No! Current assets are growing, increasing, the enterprise feels amazing.

01:20.000 --> 01:32.000
The company has huge reserves, it never has a failure, it has no problems with deliveries,

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
it has all the reserves, any reserves.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Fat cat.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The other side of the coin.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Some of the reserves are dead, superfluous.

01:47.000 --> 01:56.000
Taking all the risks into account, the enterprise freezes a huge amount of its assets in reserves.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Naturally, the economic profitability of these assets is lower.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But the enterprise has no problems.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
As they say, if it doesn't hurt, the head will go.

02:09.000 --> 02:20.000
No problems with failures in the production, supply or implementation process.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Aggressive policy of managing capital is typical of passive policy.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
A sign of this policy is a significant pre-emphasis in the passive short-term loan.

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
The enterprise takes only short-term loans, uses them actively and returns them quickly.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
If short-term loans prevail among all passives, it means that the enterprise is taking aggressive policy.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
What does it give to the enterprise? Why does the enterprise use aggressive policy?

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
A short-term loan has its pros and cons.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
The short-term loan has a lower interest rate.

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
A short-term loan in a bank can be charged at a lower rate than a long-term loan.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
The second advantage of short-term loans is that there are forms of loans

03:22.000 --> 03:33.000
that can be obtained for a period of a month without a deposit.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
But this form of loan has its cons.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
A short-term loan must be returned very quickly.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
Therefore, only a short-term loan can be used by an enterprise

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
that quickly returns its profits to the enterprise.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
Only for such enterprises with a short cycle, such a policy of managing capital is possible.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
If an enterprise has a longer production cycle, it cannot use this policy.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
If an enterprise takes a short-term loan and invests it in the production process,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
it has no means to return it.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
At the same time, the use of such a policy gives the enterprise an additional higher level of financial leverage.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Note that if the enterprise has a low interest rate, its profitability is high.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
If the interest rate is lower than the profitability, the enterprise has a higher level of financial leverage

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
and can earn a higher margin.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Such a policy is chosen by large enterprises, which have a lot of money.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
And most importantly, such a policy is chosen by enterprises that cannot be allowed to fail.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
They cannot lose their partners, they cannot stop production.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
But imagine a metallurgical plant.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
What does it mean to have a shortage of supplies and, as a result, to stop the Martenovskaya furnace?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Domina furnace.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
If you stop the domina furnace, a goat is formed there,

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
which is very difficult to extract, it is a waste of time, money, and so on.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
There is a production that cannot be stopped under any circumstances.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
There should be a surplus of supplies, it should be insured in all cases.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Here is the policy of a fat cat.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
There is a diametrically opposite policy of asset management.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Conservative policy.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
Conservative policy is diametrically opposite in the sense that it is used only by enterprises that have very little turnover.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
So little that they tremble for every penny.

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
And they are forced to spend their money only on the most necessary assets.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
They calculate up to every penny, they spend it very rationally.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Yes, because of this, they have a very high profitability of assets.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
They have a very rational use of money.

06:43.000 --> 06:51.000
But the opposite side, because they have very few assets, they can have a break.

06:54.000 --> 07:04.000
Therefore, conservative policy can be used only by the poor, when there is simply not enough money and every penny is on the account.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Or with a high degree of business.

07:07.000 --> 07:18.000
If you have clearly specified the needs in the supply and production, and the uncertainty is reduced to zero or its minimum value,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
then the amount of supplies can be reduced to the minimum value.

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
Because you know exactly when and how much you need, and this is determined by the course of the production process.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Therefore, in these two cases, conservative policy is used.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
A sign of conservative policy is a low interest rate of short-term loans in the total amount of passives.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
That is, you pay very little to the bank, you take a loan.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
While the sign of the policy of a fat cat, aggressive policy, is a high interest rate of short-term loans.

07:58.000 --> 08:08.000
In conservative policy, all assets are financed by permanent passives.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Own money, long-term loans and loans.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Because short-term loans are used very little.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
And, accordingly, the effect of the financial lever is quite low.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
And the third group of businessmen, enterprises that use policy, is moderate policy or centrists.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
They do not belong to the fat cats or do not work poorly.

08:37.000 --> 08:47.000
They do not have excess assets or are not in a state when there are no funds at all.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
They are within the moderate middle.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
Probably, this is an optimal size that avoids shortcomings inherent in the extreme.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
But at the same time, it does not give the advantages that these extremes have.

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
Those who pursue centrist policy, their risk of unpaid ability is at a certain average size.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So acceptable, convenient to them.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
No one makes any claims to them.

09:17.000 --> 09:28.000
But at the same time, they do not have excess money, thanks to which these risks can be reduced to zero.

09:28.000 --> 09:38.000
A sign of moderate centrist policy is the lack or very low rate of short-term loans in the total amount of passives.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Only long-term loans prevail there.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
There are practically no short-term loans.

09:46.000 --> 09:59.000
If we combine all the signs listed in one single table, we will get a matrix of the choice of policy, operative management of current assets and passives.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Please look at the slide that is now in front of you.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
You see the matrix in which the policy of management of current assets and the policy of management of current passives are combined.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
There are three types of management that we have just discussed.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Aggressive, moderate and conservative.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
The intersection of these types of management gives us the financial policy that is applied at the enterprise.

10:29.000 --> 10:42.000
From this slide you can see that aggressive policy in relation to passives is not combined with conservative policy in relation to assets.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
It is impossible, there is no such enterprise that could use these two policies.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
The aggressive policy of assets, of fat cats, is not combined with conservative policy of passives.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
All other combinations are possible.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Combination of two aggressive policies gives an aggressive state of the enterprise on the market.

11:07.000 --> 11:18.000
The enterprise uses only short-term loans and with the help of these loans it buys huge amounts of reserves.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
It has no problems.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
This is aggressive policy.

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
On the contrary, the conservative policy is applied on both sides of the asset and the passive.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
The enterprise saves every penny and looks at their expenses very scrupulously.

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
At the same time it does not use short-term loans, but only long-term loans.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
This is the conservative policy of assets and passives.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
All other combinations give us moderate policy.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
Moderate policy in both assets and passives.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
If you ask what is the best form of policy for the enterprise,

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
I will tell you that there is no such form that would be ideal, that you should strive for.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
The form is determined by the state in which the enterprise is already.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
If the enterprise has a huge amount of money, as they say, the chickens do not bite,

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
then for it is more convenient to use aggressive policy.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
Of course, such an enterprise is able to take care of its reputation on the market.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
It cannot afford any failures.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Therefore, it leads an aggressive policy.

12:54.000 --> 13:03.000
For its reliability on the market, it has to pay more, use more funds invested in assets.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
On the contrary, when the enterprise has no money at all, it has no other policy than the conservative one.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Life itself makes it work in the conditions of conservative policy.

13:15.000 --> 13:23.000
And if the enterprise is in a normal state, in which the vast majority of enterprises are,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
it leads a moderate policy.

13:26.000 --> 13:37.000
It uses short-term money, but it does not spend it left and right.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
It rationally invests it in reserves, and there is no surplus in these reserves.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
This is how the vast majority of enterprises work.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
If you want to work as a vast majority of enterprises, which is a normal state for a business,

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
then you have to choose a moderate policy of operational management of current assets and passives.

14:03.000 --> 14:13.000
Next, we will talk about how the management of elements of current assets is going on.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
One of the most important elements of current assets, as we have discussed today, is reserves.

14:21.000 --> 14:32.000
Reserves are assets that are intended by the enterprise to function normally within its business cycle,

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
to ensure a normal, rhythmic state of the enterprise.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
As you remember, the enterprise's production cycle consists of three parts.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
The first part is the purchase of raw materials, and then there are the reserves for raw materials.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
The second part is the production process, and then there is the unfinished production.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
And some of the raw materials are in the form of unfinished production.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
And the third part is the production process, and then there are the reserves for the finished products.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And the enterprise needs each of these forms.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
It should only choose the optimal combination of these forms, and distribute its reserves among them.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
And the financial stability of the enterprise depends on how it distributes these reserves.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
We have already discussed that the reserves are influenced not only by the production structure,

15:42.000 --> 15:52.000
but also by the seasonality, and the purpose of the production.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Sometimes the products need to be produced at a specific date,

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
and the reserves need to be prepared for this date.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
We have already said that the reserves should be of the optimal size.

16:11.000 --> 16:21.000
What if, on the contrary, the reserves are not of the optimal size?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
What will the enterprise get then?

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
What negative aspects will be characteristic for the enterprise?

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
We should know what is negative, and what we should not allow the enterprise to do,

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
which indicates the inoptimal size of the reserves.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
If the reserve size is higher than required, what does this indicate?

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
First of all, if the reserve size is increasing,

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
this should tell us about the increase in the volume of production.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
The larger the volume of production, the larger the reserve size.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Of course, in order to produce more products,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
we need to buy more raw materials,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
we need to have more products in unfinished production,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
and, accordingly, we need to have more products in unfulfilled production.

17:10.000 --> 17:19.000
Therefore, the size of the reserves is always compared with the volume of production.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
If the volume of production is increasing,

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
the size of the reserves does not play a negative role.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
If the volume of production is increasing by 2 times,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
the size of the reserves could also increase by 2 times.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
This is a normal state of the enterprise.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
But if the size of the reserves is increasing by 2 times,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and the volume of production is increasing by only 10%,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
this is not a normal state.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
We need to look closely at why this happened.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Of course, if before that there were insufficient reserves,

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
this may indicate the transition to the optimal regime.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
But if before that we had an optimal reserve regime,

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
then the increase in reserves is faster than the increase in the volume of production

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
indicates that there is an abnormal, excessive increase in the reserves

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
and, accordingly, their freezing.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
The increase in the number of reserves is also used by the business to protect it from inflation.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
If inflation is growing at a very high rate,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
then the business is protected from it.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
We, as physical persons,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
were protected from inflation at high rates by the fact that

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
we were transferring money from a weak currency to a stronger currency,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
for example, dollars or euros,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
and the currency that has less inflation

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
thus preserved its money.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
Legal entities do not have the possibility to freely transfer money from one currency to another,

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
so they use another form of saving money in the conditions of inflation.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
They increase their reserves.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
The thing is that the reserves that have been acquired have not increased in price.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
They have been bought, and they are available, and they can be used at any time.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
At the same time, if they are not bought,

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
then due to inflation and the increase in prices,

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
after some time, the same reserves will cost more.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Therefore, in the conditions of inflation,

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
free money was used to buy reserves.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
They are still needed, they will be used in production.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
So, it is more profitable to store them in reserves than to depreciate them.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Another thing is that, again, it can be compared,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
because money is not necessarily stored in the form of reserves,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
it can be stored in another form, for example, in bank deposits.

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
It can only be compared that it is economically more profitable to invest in a bank for interest,

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
or to protect from inflation,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
which will give more benefit,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
then the mechanism is more profitable to use.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Usually, usually,

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
it is more profitable to protect from inflation than to use it as a deposit.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
Therefore, enterprises increase the volume of reserves,

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
preferring to increase the investment of money in deposits.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
About the ineffectiveness of the use of reserves,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
it is also evidenced by freezing of reserves,

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
excessive freezing of reserves in the form of unfulfilled production,

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
or in the form of reserves in the stock of raw materials.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
If there is an excessive amount of reserves,

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
it leads to the fact that the enterprise is not effectively using its money.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Therefore, excessive increase of reserves is harmful.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
The opposite situation is when we have a shortage of reserves at the enterprise.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
This is also not good.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
If the enterprise is short of reserves,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
then the enterprise starts to break down in production,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
the rhythm of production is disrupted.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
This is also bad,

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
because the enterprise is in a frenzy, it stops.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
My favorite example is again with this car steering wheel.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
There are no wheels, and the whole car was stopped.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
A small detail, from which the entire conveyer of the car was stopped.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Everything is needed.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
The enterprise should work rhythmically, without interruptions.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Therefore, there should be a sufficient amount of reserves.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Another thing, perhaps another,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
a shortage of reserves leads to the fact that the enterprise is underloaded

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
and starts to produce less than it is able to produce.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
The volume of production decreases,

22:23.000 --> 22:32.000
the enterprise receives less income than it can produce.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
If the enterprise does not work to its maximum,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
its production cost increases.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
The fact is that the enterprise has all the main means of amortization.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
If the enterprise reduces the volume of production,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
then the unit of production through amortization

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
has to produce more and more resources.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
As a result, the cost of production increases.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Remember, we once said that it is much more profitable

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
for the enterprise to produce more pencils than one.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Because one pencil amortizes the entire enterprise.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
And the cost of a pencil is so huge that it comes out as gold.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And when a lot of pencils are produced at the enterprise,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
then the cost of a pencil is small.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
Because all amortization is due to a huge amount of produced products.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Therefore, it is not profitable for the enterprise

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
to reduce the volume of produced products.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Because then the cost of production increases.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
The cost of production increases.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
It receives less profit than the production on the market.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
All this together leads to a deterioration of the financial state of the enterprise.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
And the task of every financial director

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
is not to allow the deterioration of the financial situation at the enterprise.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
Therefore, the amount of reserves should be optimal.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
And how to calculate the financial amount of reserves needed for the enterprise?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Here is the formula in front of you.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Look carefully at the screen.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
And you will see how the amount of financial resources

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
allocated to the reserves is calculated.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
You see that this amount is equal to the production

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
volume of the reserves per day per reserve storage standard.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
This is the amount of money that should be spent on reserves

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
if you were not credited.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
Your partners in the market did not provide you with a return,

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
or rather, in the term of the reserve in the form of a commodity credit.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
But since we live in a real market,

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
where it is customary to provide reserves in installments,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
we must subtract the amount of reserves needed

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
from the amount that the commodity credit provides us for a certain time.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
Therefore, you see in this formula a minus to the creditorial debt.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
The amount of financing is calculated according to each reserve,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
according to each type of reserve that is required.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
And it is determined what amount of funds should be invested in these reserves.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
What is the optimal amount of reserves that should be invested?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
This is the task of optimization.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It is very interesting, and I will gladly tell you about it.

25:56.000 --> 26:06.000
The thing is that if we bring a huge amount of reserves,

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
then our transport costs become minimal.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
Of course, we loaded a huge amount of transport resources

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
and delivered a large amount of reserves.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
But the larger the amount of reserves that we bring,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
the larger the warehouse that is needed for its storage.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
And by saving on transport costs, we get huge costs for storage.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
We need to build a huge warehouse,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
we need a lot of workers who will serve it,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
we need to pay additional costs for storage.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Thus, we see that huge reserves lead to an increase in costs

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
for storing these reserves.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
But there is a reverse situation.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
If we want to have minimal costs for storage,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
not having a warehouse at all,

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
or having a small warehouse with small costs for its service,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
then we should often bring our reserves and update them.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
But if we bring them often,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
in other words, we will update the reserves every day,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
and there will be a supply every day,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
then our costs for transportation will increase.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
And despite the fact that the costs for storage will be small,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
the costs for transportation will be large.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
For an enterprise, the cost is the amount of costs

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
for both storage and transportation.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
And the enterprise should minimize this amount.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
This problem is solved mathematically,

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
and we get the amount of reserves

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
with minimal total costs.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
The Wilson model is presented in the form of a formula on the slide,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
which you see now.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
The optimal size of the batch that needs to be brought

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
in order to minimize the total costs

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
is determined in this way.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
In this formula, you see the necessary volume of goods purchased

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
and the ratio of goods delivered to goods stored.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
The value calculated in this way

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
is the value of the optimal size of the batch delivered.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
If an enterprise, knowing this,

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
purchases reserves with such volumes,

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
then it will incur the lowest costs

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
for purchasing these reserves.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Let's make an example that would consolidate

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
our theoretical idea about purchasing raw materials.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Let's say we have a yearly demand for raw materials

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
of 1 million rubles.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
The current delivery costs are 12 thousand rubles,

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
and the current storage costs are 6 thousand rubles.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
What is the optimal size of the batch delivered?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We substitute the Wilson formula,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
which we have just discussed,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
and we find that the optimal form for one time

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
is to deliver raw materials for 63 thousand rubles.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
No more, no less.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Since we need a yearly demand of 1 million,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
we can calculate how many times a year

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
we should deliver our raw materials.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
1 million divided by 63 thousand

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
is 16 times.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
That is, we should deliver raw materials 16 times a year.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
No more, no less.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Because both more times and less times

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
lead to the fact that our costs for raw materials

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
will increase,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
and at 16 times we will have the lowest costs.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
In other words, every 22 days

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
we should receive a new batch of raw materials.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
At the same time, the costs for maintenance will be minimal.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
This is how this optimization task is solved.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
And every enterprise that is engaged in the production process

30:30.000 --> 30:37.000
is able to calculate how often and what batch of supplies

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
it needs to be updated

30:39.000 --> 30:47.000
in order to have the lowest costs for supplies.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
The next issue we will discuss here

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
is the issue of managing the debit debt.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
We have learned how to manage the debit debt.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
We should also learn how to manage the debit debt.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Remember, the debit debt is what is owed to your enterprise,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
but not yet received.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
This is the money you gave to other enterprises,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
and they use this money.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
But they must return it to you.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
The other issue is when and on what terms.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
We have already discussed that the debit debt

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
is a sign of the market,

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
of the modern market we are in.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
If an enterprise does not transfer

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
a part of the finished product as a commodity loan

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
to other enterprises,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
they will forget about it.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And the consumers will be transferred to competitors

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
who provide commodity loans.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Therefore, since we are within the market,

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
and it is impossible to live in a society and be free from society,

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
we must provide our commodity in the form of a commodity loan

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
just as other market participants do.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Therefore, the debit debt is a sign of the market,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
a sign of the market we are in.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
It exists in all enterprises

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
that are connected with production and trade.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Another thing is that the debit debt must be of the optimal size.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
Again, the excessive size of the debit debt is bad,

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
just as the absence of the debit debt is also a negative point.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
We must understand that when an enterprise provides a debit debt,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
it distracts its own funds,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
and transfers them to other enterprises,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
and cannot use them in its own business.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
But on the other hand, it is forced to do so,

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
because otherwise it will not be able to buy a commodity at all.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Several factors affect the level of the debit debt.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
The first is the assessment of the buyers by their reliability.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Before providing a commodity loan to a buyer,

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
any enterprise assesses the reliability of the buyer as a business partner.

33:19.000 --> 33:27.000
If the buyer is reliable and has bought your product many times,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
and has paid for it in time,

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
then such an enterprise can be provided with a commodity loan

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
and receive a debit debt.

33:40.000 --> 33:49.000
Since you are sure that you will be paid the money as agreed upon in the agreed time,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
and the business process will not be disrupted.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
But if you do not know this partner,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
if he has appeared on the market for the first time,

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
and if he is not sure that he will work well on the market,

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
then you can refuse to provide this partner with a commodity loan.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.000
You can say that he should first earn his reputation with his own funds,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
show that he is a reliable business partner,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
and then ask you for a commodity loan.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
In this case, you will do absolutely right from the business point of view,

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
because all your competitors will do the same with this business partner.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
You will not lose here.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
No one will lend to a unreliable business partner.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
If you remember the beginning of the 90s,

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
when capitalism was just born in our country,

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
and our enterprises bought goods abroad,

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
and brought them to the country to implement them here,

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
then all our trade organizations spoke in one voice

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
about the unequal attitude to us,

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
and to other foreign partners.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.000
Foreign enterprises provided commodity loans to other foreign trade companies,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
but not to our own.

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
Our enterprises were forced to buy on prepayment.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
First you pay, and then you get the goods.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Why? Because we were not reliable trade partners yet.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
We have just appeared on the market,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
no one knew us, no one trusted us,

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
no one believed in us.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
But the years decide.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Those enterprises that for many years

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
recommended themselves as reliable partners,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
gradually began to receive commodity loans.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
And today, Russian enterprises,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
large importers,

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
all of them use commodity loans.

36:14.000 --> 36:22.000
Just like we provide our customers with commodity loans.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Therefore, the customer's assessment of their reliability

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
is the most important point in the decision of whether to provide a commodity loan or not.
