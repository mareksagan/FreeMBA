00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, my name is Vladislava Drudko.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I am the Director of the Department of Program for Leadership and Personal Effectiveness,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
certified Master Trainer.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I have 20 years of experience in business training,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
10 years in the position of a top manager in large financial and insurance companies.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Today, as part of the program Organizational Behavior,

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
we will consider the concept of a group and a team and group dynamics,

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
as well as get acquainted with the stages of the development of the team and the distribution of roles in the team.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
Today there are a lot of disputes about what a group is and what a team is.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Many believe that these concepts are very interconnected,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
and the group is called a team, and the team is called a group.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Our task is to understand what is the difference between a group and a team.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
We often use these concepts as interconnected,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
but there is a significant difference between them.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
What are the similarities and differences of a team?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Is it always necessary to create a team at certain stages of the development of the entire company?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Or is it enough to just do a group interaction?

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's first define the concepts of a group and a team.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Please pay attention to the first slide and the concept of a group given by Shine and Bennis.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
A group is a number of people who interact with each other,

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
psychologically recognize each other and perceive themselves as a group.

01:48.000 --> 02:02.000
And a team is a group of people who share responsibility for the results of the organization's activities.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Please pay attention to the key word that distinguishes a group from a team.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
This is responsibility for the results of the organization's activities.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
You can see the main differences between a group and a team on the suggested table.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
You can notice that a group from a team is separated by the size limit,

02:29.000 --> 02:40.000
common goals, role distribution, transparent and understandable interaction between team members and teamwork.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Let's consider the concept of a group and a team using the example of a management company.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
A management company has a financial department headed by a financial inspector.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
This company has a relatively limited number of employees

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
who follow a common, understandable and acceptable goal.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
The tasks, roles and responsibilities are clearly distributed between them.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We call the financial department a team.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
Again, because these people are connected by a common goal, transparent communication and distributed roles.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
However, this financial department is part of a large management company,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
where there are many other departments.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
For example, the personnel department, the personnel department, the sales department, the selection department, and so on.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
The employees of each of these departments are not united by a common goal,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
and certain tasks are not distributed between them.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
They simply realize themselves as part of a whole, as part of a large organization.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
Therefore, we call the employees of different departments in one management company a group of people.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
If we go further and pay attention to the top managers,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
to the managers of these departments, who gather for weekly meetings,

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
plan their work, plan their work,

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
plan the activities of the whole organization, follow the common goal of the company.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
We call the top managers a group of top managers.

04:31.000 --> 04:42.000
Thus, you can learn for yourself once again that the group of top managers is distinguished by the key words.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
These are the following words, the following words are the following words,

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
the following words are the following words,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
What do teams need?

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
Teams are needed in those situations when a large number of work is needed.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
When this work is not possible for one person.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
Also, in the situation of uncertainty and changes, team work increases efficiency.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Because when the roles are distributed and people clearly understand the goals,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
the stress level is noticeably reduced.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
This means that interpersonal communication is more transparent, more understandable, and therefore more comfortable.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
Let's look at the example of a team and a group on two sports teams.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
On a baseball team and on a basketball team.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
If you remember the rules of the game in a baseball team,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
the members of the group are relatively independent of each other and never interact together.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Thus, it is a group of athletes.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
But in a basketball team, the rules are completely different.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
The members of the group constantly interact with each other on the field,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
run, defend, attack, score.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
When a new player comes out on the field, the team members must play with him.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Thus, basketball is a sports team.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
Let's now pay attention and consider the criteria for the effectiveness of the team's activities.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Please pay attention to the proposed slide.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
There are only five criteria for the effectiveness of the team's activities.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
You already know some of them.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
The task, planning and setting goals.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
If there are no clear and transparent goals in the team,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
if the work is not planned for the future,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
if the team members do not know what specific task they are performing,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
it reduces the effectiveness of the team's work.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
The roles in the team.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Each member of the team understands what role he plays.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
We will talk about the roles a little later.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
The process of the team's functioning.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Interpersonal relations.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Relations between teams.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So, the main criteria for the effectiveness of the team's activities.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You can see these criteria on the proposed slide.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
There are only five of them.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Let's briefly discuss each of them.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
The task, planning and setting goals.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
This is a very important point to create an effective team.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
I often go to other companies as a consultant.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
It is always interesting to ask a question to the employee.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Why do you come to work in this particular company?

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
70% of employees answer that they want to do anything,

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
but not what is related to their personal goal or business organization.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Anything is related to their close relationship with the company,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
good social status,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
the company has a good reputation in the market,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
a car is on loan, and so on.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
The goal for the employee, the goal and the task set

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
is the first step to increase his motivation to work in the group.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
It is believed that setting goals increases the efficiency of work by 16%

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
due to motivation.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I will give you a simple example.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
In my training, there are participants who learn the rules of setting goals and planning.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
I put a trash can in front of them and ask one participant to roll up as much paper as possible

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
and throw it into the trash can.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
The participant tries to crush the paper,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
throwing it into the trash can,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
not understanding what I want from him.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
When he finishes this work,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
and I notice the time before he starts throwing the paper,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
I ask the next participant to do the following work.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
In 5 minutes, after throwing the paper into the trash can,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
we counted the number of paper thrown, there were 15,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
we need to throw more than 15 papers.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Guess how the second participant behaved in the training,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
to whom I clearly outlined the time and the number.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
He got a drive.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
He began to rush to throw as many as possible 15 rolled papers.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
When he really did the exercise and threw more than 15 papers into the trash can in 5 minutes.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
When I stopped the exercise,

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
two participants who took part in this game were in different emotional states.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Which of them was more offended by me?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Of course, the first one. Why?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I asked him a question.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
You are now in a very uncomfortable state. Why?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
He did not answer.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Vlad, you did not set a clear goal in front of me.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
You did not tell me the number.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And I did not understand what you wanted from me.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
You see, a clearly outlined goal in time, space and quantity

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
will always motivate your employees to achieve something.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
Therefore, remember that one of the important criteria for effective work in a group

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
is setting goals, planning and assigning tasks.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So, the roles in the team.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
The roles in the team are the distribution of responsibility between the members of one team.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
Who, why, when, why, who is reported to, and who gives whom what tools or documents.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
The next criterion is the process of team functioning.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
At this stage, it is very important to discuss, talk to people, talk to subordinates,

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
meet with them as often as possible and give them feedback as much as possible

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and ask them what is going on.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
The process of team functioning determines the norms of behavior of employees in one team,

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
the type and style of decision-making, methods of motivation and punishment.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
As for how often you talk to your subordinates,

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
the last and probably the most recorded answer I heard from one of the managers of the sales department

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
was once a quarter.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
I asked him the next question, how effective is the sales in your department.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
I believe that the participant Slukavil said that it is very effective.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Although, a big question arises,

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
can a team be effective if it sees its manager once every three months?

12:11.000 --> 12:20.000
We are talking about people who wish and enjoy being in the company.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
We all grew up in a family, we all grew up in the environment of people,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
and therefore the models of human behavior are connected,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
no matter where he is in the organization or wherever he is,

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
to the need and need for socializing, communication, feedback and the ability to share your feelings.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
If you use this policy of meeting with your subordinates once a quarter,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
I will also have a question for you.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
And the last criterion is the relationship between teams.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
This is a very important criterion for the effectiveness of the work of one team.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Why?

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
Today in business, very often one team within a large corporation or company

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
greatly affects the effectiveness of the work of another team.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Let's take a simple example.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
The sales department has clear global plans for the interception of clients and competitors.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
Accordingly, to implement these plans, the sales department needs a certain number of good, cool sales.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
The sales department is traditionally addressed to the personnel department.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
The personnel department has many important tasks,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
because each department has its own specific plans.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
And you know that the shortage of personnel always exists with good personnel within any company.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
And so the sales department is addressed to the personnel department with an application

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
to select a certain number of sales managers with certain competencies.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Accordingly, the tasks of the sales department are different,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
because there are many other departments.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
It is very important how well people communicate with each other and how well they can agree.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
This can also be a part of the team.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
Usually, in companies that pay great attention to the increase in the effectiveness of the work of employees,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
when new projects are created,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
for example, the project that I just mentioned in the sales department

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
is a new project.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
Therefore, very often companies gather a team of employees of the personnel department

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
and employees of the sales department for the so-called team building.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And there they learn to live together.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
After they try new role models in training,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
build interpersonal relationships,

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
return to their usual life, it is much easier for them to agree.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Because in business there are not only formal policies and procedures,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
but also interpersonal communication.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
So, now we have considered the main criteria for the effectiveness of the team's activities.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I will give you one example,

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
which was once presented as an experiment at the University of London.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
The experiment was called an intergroup conference.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
What was done?

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
Employees were divided into two groups of participants and a consultant was assigned to them.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
The consultant was not a facilitator and a leader of this group,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
he just observed the work and the behavior of the participants

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
and expressed his critical and non-critical assessments to each participant.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What was happening in the group?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Since there was no established leader in the group,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
the goals and tasks were not clearly defined,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
why people were gathered here.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
The level of anxiety increased noticeably.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
And the behavior of people was accompanied by a very high degree of aggression,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
even hysterical laughter.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
People began to express unpleasant things to each other.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Then they tried to change the consultant.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And after the failed attempt to change the consultant,

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
as usually happens in a class where there is no good teacher,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
employees found a release goat in the group

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
and began to place all their aggression on this person.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Therefore, part of the team just self-eliminated.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Nobody wanted to be a release goat,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
so people just froze and did not express any emotions at all.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
The experiment ended there.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
As a result, people did everything they wanted,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
but did not study their own behavior.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I told this example to those above-mentioned criteria,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
which I just commented on.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
It is very important that if there are no clearly defined goals,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
roles, tasks, and roles of the leader,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
we will talk about this in a separate course today,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
interpersonal communication will never be built.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And if there are no goals in the team,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
and interpersonal communication is not built,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
it cannot be effective.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
So, dear, we will move on with you.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
We have already learned about the criteria for the effectiveness of the team's activities,

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
and we have analyzed each of them in detail at the example of the group conference.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Now we will get acquainted with what group dynamics is.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
The word dynamics itself is an antonym for the word static.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Let's turn to the slide and get acquainted with the definition.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
What is group dynamics?

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
Group dynamics is the designation, unlike the group statics,

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
of a set of dynamic processes that occur simultaneously in a group

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
for a certain period of time,

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
and which are the movement of the group from stage to stage,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
that is, its development.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, probably, it is not a secret for any of you that movement is life,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
and a person develops only by means of movement.

18:33.000 --> 18:41.000
Let's try to observe how the development of a group or a team occurs.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
We will consider this on the model of Tuckman,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
the most popular model in business,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
which is often used,

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
which outlined the four main stages of the development of a group,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
the development of a team.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Please pay attention to the proposed slide.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
You may notice that there is an uneven distribution of the graph,

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
and it moves not along the rising, but along the descending trajectory.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
So, the first stage of the development of a team is formation.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
What is formation of a team relative to those criteria

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
that we have just considered in detail?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
At the stage of formation of a team,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
people treat each other very carefully and carefully.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
People look at each other,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
make a conscious or unconscious choice

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
who they are with, why they are there,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
whom they trust in the team

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
— it is not a team yet, in a group —

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
whom they do not trust.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
What happens at the stage of formation of a group?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
There are no clearly defined goals,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
there are no clearly distributed roles,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
interpersonal communications are not built,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
despite the fact that there are no conflicts in the group,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
the group exists quite calmly,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
however, there are hidden, yet unexpressed conflicts

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
within each employee, within each individual.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
I repeat, people treat each other politely,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
but this is a signal for you, as for the leader,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
to think that politeness at the stage of formation of a team

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
is not a success,

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
it is a behavior, a natural behavior of a person

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
who is still making a conscious choice

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
who he is going with, what he is going for,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
and why he is doing it.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
So, at the stage of formation,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
there is a certain style of management.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
I think you, as a leader,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
should learn this style as a rigid and directive one.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
At this stage, the leader is a bright,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
pronounced leader.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
The style of management is directive,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
the tasks are clearly set, there is clear control.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
There is no place for delegating powers

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
and opportunities to interact,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
consult and ask.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
The leader positions himself as a leader

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
so that at the next stages of the development of the team

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
it is easier for him to manage,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
and the next stages will be more difficult.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
The task of the leader is to provide all the resources

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
for the comfortable functioning of the team.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Here you can recall the motivational model of MacGregor

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
or Herzberg, who said that until you satisfy

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
the basic hygiene needs of a person,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
they will feel anger.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
But if you satisfy these basic hygiene needs of a person,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
such as working conditions,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
decent salary, airy hygiene,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
and the ability to eat during lunch,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
if you satisfy these criteria of the employees,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
it does not mean that they will work better.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
They will simply lack the feeling of dissatisfaction

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
or, as I said, the feeling of anger.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
It is very important for you as a leader

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
not to meet once a quarter with your employees,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
as I told you in the previous example,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
but to make these meetings as often as possible.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
The smallest, simplest,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
the most inconspicuous achievements

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
must be supported and praised by the employees.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
The smallest, I emphasize,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
because at the last stages of the development of the team

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
these achievements will be more large-scale.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And for such small achievements,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
which you praise at the stage of formation,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
it will no longer be a motivation for the employees.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
So, after you go through the stage of formation,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
the storm stage comes.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
This is one of the most difficult periods

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
in the development of the team, in the dynamics of the group,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
when people begin to express their emotions openly.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
At this stage, there are a lot of conflicts in the group,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
aggressiveness is very high,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
people do not agree with their colleagues,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
people express confrontation

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
with any ideas.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
It is very important for you as a leader

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
to learn how to manage a conflict situation

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
and manage it in a way

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
that does not mean to prohibit expressing your opinion,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
to prohibit arguing or to prohibit being aggressive.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I mean aggressiveness in the permissible limits,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
when employees do not throw cups or phones at each other,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
but aggressiveness at the level of constructive emotions.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Your task at this stage,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
within the framework of managing the conflict,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
is, on the contrary,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
to support aggressive emotions

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
and to pull them out of people,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
to get them to express their disagreement

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
or their opinion openly and freely.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
This is the main key task of the leader

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
at the storm stage.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It is clear that we are approaching

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
a different style of management.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
If we said that at the stage of formation

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
you are direct and tough,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
you just say, set tasks and demand their execution,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
then at the stage of management,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
when conflicts arise,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
people begin to express their opinion openly.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Here your task is not just to set goals or tasks,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
but to explain to people why this is happening,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
why each of them needs it.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
As for the control function,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
if at the stage of formation

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
the control function is total,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
then at the storm stage the control function is step-by-step,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
that is, after a certain period of time.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
People should understand that you give them an opportunity

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
to express themselves within the framework of this group.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And I repeat,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
it is necessary to provoke an open explanation of the relationship.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
This is very useful,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
because if at this stage you forbid people

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
with policies, procedures, rules and norms of behavior

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
an open explanation of relations,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
it will definitely emerge at the next stage,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
and you simply will not be able to go from the third stage

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
to the fourth stage.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
You will have to return to the storm stage.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
We will look at this further.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
So, the storm stage is when people have agreed,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
when they understood and saw you not only as a tough leader,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
but also as a leader who advises,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
explains and agrees on priorities.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Your team comfortably moves to the next stage of its development,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
which we call normalization.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
What is the difference between this stage and the previous two?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I have already said that the main key moment

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
when people start to understand each other

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
and understand each other's needs

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
is when people start to calm down.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Negative emotions are replaced by positive ones.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
People begin to trust each other more.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
And now all the decisions they discuss and make

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
are not painted with such a dark stain of negativity

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
as it was at the storm stage.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
This is very important.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
And you, as a leader, must remember this.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
At this stage, norms and rules are formed.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
When people have calmed down,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
when they have worked out all their emotions,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
it is time for logic.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
People begin to develop standards of interaction,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
to develop norms and rules of life.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
They are distributed spontaneously.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
The roles of the team's interaction are distributed.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Please pay attention to the slide.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
With each subsequent slide,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
you will see a number of key words in red.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
At the stage of normalization,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
the style of your management,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
please note,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
you must provide solutions to the group.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
If at the directive stage you did not provide solutions,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
but pointed out harshly,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
at the storm stage you agreed on your decisions,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
now you provide solutions to the group.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
The group has calmed down.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
It can act outside of emotions.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
It can act constructively.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Therefore, at this stage,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
it is necessary to give more freedom to creativity.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
It is very important to praise not only for small successes.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
This does not motivate employees to achieve success.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
You need to praise for victories.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
And, of course, it is not easy to publicly announce this.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
As we said, not once a quarter at meetings,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
but as often as possible.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And it is necessary to celebrate.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
This is a very important moment for the formation of a team.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Celebrate victories.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
How can you celebrate them?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
It is a fantasy for your creativity as a manager.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
It is a very important moment for the motivation of your subordinates.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Let's go back to the McGregor model.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
If you satisfy simple hygiene factors,

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
the conditions of work, salary, airy room,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
and provide them with food,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
people will not feel high motivation to achieve success.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
They will come to work and consider it necessary to act

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
for the salary you pay them from 9 to 6.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
If we move to another topic,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
we will talk about the role of the manager.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
The manager is a person who is responsible

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
for the recognition of their merits,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
the ability to make independent decisions,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
and responsibility for the work.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
The stage of celebration of the victories of employees

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
is related to the recognition of merits

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
and achievements of employees.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Therefore, do not forget to do this.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
And, of course, do not forget to celebrate.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
And, of course, do not forget to celebrate.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Therefore, do not forget to do this.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
It is very important.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Do not close your office and do not leave it once a quarter.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I had one training participant

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
when we discussed which room,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
which space you would like to occupy

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
regarding your subordinates.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
It was also the department of sales.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
The head of the department of sales said

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
that you should have a quick exit and quick entry.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
That is, you wanted to leave,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
you quickly left, you quickly closed.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
A separate office.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Do not limit yourself within a separate office.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Be with people as a leader.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And thus you will not only provide

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
the opportunity for their development.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
You understand that by developing your subordinates,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
you will not only develop yourself,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
but also your subordinates.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
You planted the grass, covered it with a film

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
and left for three quarters.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
You quickly closed your office,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
quickly left, removed the film and looked.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Who grew, well done.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Who did not grow, threw it away.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
This is the wrong way.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
When all procedures are clearly written,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
all roles are distributed,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
interpersonal relations are built between people.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Please pay attention to the proposed slide.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Employees are proud not for themselves,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
but for their team.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
They express their respect and gratitude

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
to the members of their team.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
The key word here is high level.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
People are not afraid to bring their list of clients

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
to the CRM system.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
You know that CRM systems are very difficult

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
to implement in companies.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
The question is why this is happening.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
In the companies that I worked for,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
maybe I was not lucky,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
the CRM system is not fully implemented.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
The question is why it is not implemented.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
I am told by the managers of the sales departments

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
who work with clients,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
with large corporate and retail companies,

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
that managers do not bring their clients

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
to this base for a certain reason.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Why would I bring my client?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Someone will sell a parallel product,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
he will see this client and use my contact.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
And then go and prove where and why.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Let's talk about trust.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
If you have lived through all the stages correctly,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
and your team has reached the stage of action,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
the key word is that trust is formed

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
between employees

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
towards each other and towards you as a leader.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Therefore, the main tasks of your manager

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
at the stage of action

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
are the following.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
The following slide is the control of the result.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
If you remember,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
at the stage of formation it is total control,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
at the stage of storm it is step-by-step,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
at the stage of action it is control of the result.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
You trust your employees.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
You don't need to control the letters

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
they wrote in the slide,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
where they put a comma before they go to the presentation

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
You trust them.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Please note that the final decision,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
the elimination of the process

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
and participation as one of the players

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
is only at the stage of decision-making.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
That is, you fully delegate the functions

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
as a leader to your team.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
Again, because you trust them.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
So, dear listeners,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
we have just started the four stages of the development of the team.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
We call it the group dynamics.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Any team follows and develops

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
according to the proposed TACMAN scheme.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
This can be transferred not only to the business team,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
but also to personal life and personal relations.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Any relations

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
go through certain periods of their development.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Each period is very useful and very important.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
You don't need to worry

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
when conflicts arise in your team.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
You need to work with them.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
You don't need to worry when people in your team

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
self-isolate and remain silent.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
You need to work with it.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
When you gather a new team and new people

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
and your employees politely smile at each other,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
you shouldn't be proud that you are doing well.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
So, excessive leadership and insufficient leadership.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
These are two key problems

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
that a leader faces

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
when he tries to manage a team.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
There are consequences of excessive leadership

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
and consequences of insufficient leadership.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
So, dear listeners,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
the consequences of insufficient leadership

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
and the consequences of excessive leadership.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
I think each of you has a lot of experience

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
in your professional life.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Not only as a leader,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
but also as a member of the same team.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
What can happen to you

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
if your leader,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
having misused the management style

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
for the development of you and your team,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
uses the style of excessive leadership?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
What are your assumptions?

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
What about your initiatives?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
When you offer something,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
do you say, no, you should do it this way?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Of course, it falls down right away.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
What about your emotions and attitude towards your boss?

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Of course, you feel anger and resentment.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
You feel that you are not understood,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
that you are not listened to,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
and that you are not respected.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
But the main thing is that when you,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
or your boss, controls you excessively,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
you start to get used to him.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
You start to feel complete dependence on him as a leader.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
Let's check your assumptions

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
and your correct or incorrect answers.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
It is also very good.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
The main thing is that you work with it.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Pay attention to the following slide.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
The consequences of excessive leadership.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Complete dependence on the leaders.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Lack of initiative.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Lack of professional growth.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Anger and resentment towards the leader

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
who, as you think,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
is the leader,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
causes you all kinds of resentment and obstacles.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
What about the situation of insufficient leadership?

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
When the leader does not control the process to a lesser extent.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Do you remember I told you about the grass

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
that was sown, covered with a film,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
and then removed and looked at who had grown.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
What do you think can happen?

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Always remember an interesting example.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Probably, each of you was a student

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
and passed the exam at a respectable, smart professor.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
When you answer your question to the professor,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
he has two tactics.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
One is that he sits and actively,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
covering his eyes, supports your idea, your topic.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
You feel great.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
You understand that you are moving on the right path

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
and you are igniting.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
Or the professor who sits,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
is silent and looks at you.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
And you start to lose your confidence.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Are you speaking the right way?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Are you moving in the right direction?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Why is the professor silent now?

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
That's right, dear listeners.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
If you do not interact with your subordinates enough,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
if you do not exchange with them the essence of the work,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
if you do not give them feedback,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
if you do not give them critical feedback,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
they lose their confidence.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
They are afraid to take the next steps in their work

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
because they do not know if they have taken the right step.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
The confidence of the employees in their work is greatly lost.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Of course, the work is not always done as you would like.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
You sowed, you left, you came back.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
I said that you should do it this way.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
The work will not always be done as you want.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Because you have a completely different understanding

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
of what a well-done work is.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Do you remember Einstein's theory of relativity?

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
What is one minute?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Sitting in a hot pan for one minute is terribly long.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Standing with your beloved person in the evening by the fountain is very little.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
The same is true here.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
You have a completely different understanding of what a well-done work is.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Therefore, people will probably try to do the work,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
but not as you would like.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
If, unlike the previous case,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
employees feel anger and resentment,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
suppressed aggression,

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
here they feel complete disappointment in their work.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Because they do everything wrong,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
they have a low self-esteem,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
but they do not feel that they are doing more,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
and that is good.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Remember the statistics of the Gallup Organization.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
They say that after studying a huge number of hundreds of thousands of people,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
they came to the conclusion that people come to business,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
but leave.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Guess who?

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Of course, the manager.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Before moving on to the next topic of the role in the team,

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
let's briefly consider the curve of change proposed by Adams and Hobson.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
The curve of change is a visual indicator

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
of how changes affect the psychology of the person,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
employee,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
or the psychology of the behavior of the entire team,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
of your entire subordinate team,

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
of each individual employee,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and, in general, of you as a manager.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
So, the first stage,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
pay attention to the slide,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
the first stage is called shock.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
When a person encounters

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
some catastrophic changes in his life,

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
he experiences such emotional constriction.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
They say that this way his body tries to prepare his mind

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
for further development of the event.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
But you can see from the graph that it is very tense,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
this dynamic.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
So, the shock stage is emotional constriction.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
You often hear in everyday life,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
when a person learns some incredible news,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
he says the following phrase,

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm in shock.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
This is exactly what we are talking about now,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
and this is exactly the true feeling that a person experiences

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
when he encounters catastrophic emotional events.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
When a person plays in the Olympic Games,

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
we also fall into a state of shock, constriction.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
However, this is only the beginning of the process of change

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
that occurs in a person,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
in a separate person,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
or in the whole team as a whole.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
The next stage is denial and anger.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
After a person has experienced a shock,

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
he enters into open aggression,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
he begins to blame himself, others,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
for not being able to foresee this earlier,

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
why we did not notice that you are to blame for this,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
I am to blame for this, the whole world is to blame for this,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
the coach is to blame for this.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
He begins to reveal all kinds of emotions that a person has.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
This is the stage of aggression.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
He is experienced exactly after the shock and denial stage.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
So, when a person is emotionally exhausted,

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
he goes to the next stage of change,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
to the stage of bargaining.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
When he begins to reason about what happened in the past,

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
what has already happened,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
he will never be able to return to this.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
The stage of bargaining is an opportunity to make the last attempt

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
to return to the previous initial events

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
that a person experienced before the stage of shock and denial.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
However, the stage of bargaining ends very quickly,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
it is an inevitable process,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
this is how changes go through,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
I have already told you about this,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
all people, each person, a group, a team, and whole nations.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
A person goes to the next stage of change,

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
this is depression.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
This is a clear understanding that what has happened

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
before the moment of depression

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
will never happen again.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
People are always reluctant to part with the past models of behavior,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
with the past way of life,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
and with the previous experience,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
this is how the human psyche is built.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
That is why one of the most difficult changes you see,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
it is at the lowest point of self-esteem of a person,

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
at the very minimum point,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
this is the most difficult process.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
This process can be experienced not only by a person,

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
but also by a team.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
When a team goes through a stage of change,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
you will know more about this in the next courses,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
when a team goes through a stage of change,

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
they go through depression in the most difficult way.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
This is the period when teams disintegrate.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
A very strong leader is needed here,

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
who can support, inspire people,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
and accept them in a depressed emotional state.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
If a person, a group or a team,

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
a nationality,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
lives through a stage of depression,

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
a logical emotional realization comes,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
that we will never return to the past,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
what has already happened,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
and we need to live on with the new thing,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
that life has brought us.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
This is the stage of acceptance of change.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
It is not necessarily accompanied by an emotional outburst,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
it can be a humility of a person,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
that this is a new stage of life,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
and I start to live in a new way.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
This curve of change is very effective

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
and lives in companies all the time.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Remember that the curve of change

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
is accompanied by constant stressful situations.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
Every time a person, a group or a team

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
experiences incredible stress emotions.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
I know that very proactive companies,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
that are preparing for rebranding or launching new products,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
spend 80% of their budget on training,

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
not a very good word,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
but they use it for training,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
for employees on managing stress,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
on stress management.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Because at every stage of change

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
people, teams and groups experience stress,

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
and stress needs to be managed effectively.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Then at the stage of depression,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
losses of human resources and financial companies

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
will be minimal.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Everything related to stress,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
you will learn about it in our next courses.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
How stress affects the development of a company,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
and how it affects the development of a company.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
So, within the framework of group dynamics,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
we will discuss the next sub-topic,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
which is called the roles in the team.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Before that, we have learned about the stages of development of a team.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
There are four of them.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
We have learned about the curve of change,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
which is inevitable at every stage of development of a team.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Now we will learn about the roles in the team,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
and how to effectively distribute and select these roles.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
It should be noted that the effectiveness of any company

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
depends on how effectively microgroups and microteams work.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
How to build them,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
and how to make them effective.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
This question was asked by Western specialists in the late 20th century.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
They studied the group dynamics,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
and studied the roles in the team,

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
which affect the effectiveness of the results.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
And here is the most interesting discovery,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
which is being used very actively in business today,

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
not just at the level of tests,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
but also recommendations,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
which belong to Belbin.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
This is a model of the roles in the team.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
What did Belbin do?

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
He studied a huge number of models of behavior and functioning of various teams,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
and found out that each person in the team plays two roles.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
One of them is functional,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
that is, it is associated with the direct position or the specific work of the team.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
The second role is less obvious,

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
but it turns out that it plays a bigger role in the team's effectiveness.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
As a result of the study, Belbin identified 8 roles in the team.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Now you see all the listed roles on the slide.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
Let's try to get to know each of these roles in more detail.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
Perhaps you will recognize yourself in one of them,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
perhaps you will recognize your subordinates, your colleagues in one of them.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Now we are listening to the material of this course,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
and we will think about which roles are present in your team.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Probably, some roles may be missing,

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
and at the end we will talk about whether it can be done.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
So, 8 roles in the team.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
One of them is the harmonizer of relations.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
The harmonizer of relations,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
the word itself, is a very important factor.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
All the names translated from English are very close in their lexical meaning

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
to what this person does in the team.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
The harmonizer of relations is a person who is tuned to interpersonal communication.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
He is a patron, he interacts, he always calms everyone down,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
he is very comfortable with him,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
he supports everyone, he is sociable,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
he is a person of the soul.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
However, in his weak spot, in critical and crisis situations,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
these people usually feel very uncomfortable,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
tense, and often cannot withstand long,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
critical and oppressive situations.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I thought that the motto of the harmonizer of relations

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
probably belongs to John the Baptist.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
When you feed the poor,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
you consider yourself a good person.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
The next type in the team is a specialist.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
The word itself says that this person

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
is highly professional and very independent.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
He is proud of his work,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
and it is clear that this role also has its less strong sides.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
He is not a team player.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
You probably met such people in the team.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
He is a specialist, he knows his job well,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
he is a very good communicator,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
he is a specialist, he knows his job well,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
he does not feel pleasure

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
from close interpersonal interaction.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
He is an introvert.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Probably, the words of Lev Tolstoy

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
will suit him best.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Knowledge is a tool, not a goal.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
A person is a process person,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
focused on the process of work.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
The next type in the team is a researcher.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
He is a producer, he is transferred in different situations.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
The essence does not change.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
He is a resource researcher, an extrovert enthusiast,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
who creates and supports a huge wide network of contacts

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
and very skillfully uses the ideas of other people.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
There is only one weak link,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
a weak spot of the resource researcher.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
You probably met such a person

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
in the team and even in the company.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
He quickly ignites, quickly unites everyone.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Then, by the end of the evening,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
his enthusiasm goes out.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
He quickly goes out of enthusiasm.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
What motto can be come up with for such a resource researcher?

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Probably, it will be appropriate to say the words of Friedrich Engels,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
which can be translated into the mouth of a resource researcher.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Ideas ignite each other,

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
like an electric spark.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
The next role in the team is an assessment controller.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
The word itself, the assessor, the controller,

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
the lexical meaning of this word combination

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
gives you a clear profile of this role.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
This is a serious critic.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
This is a person who is practically never motivated by anything.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
He is always ready to help in all situations,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
in all matters.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
In all situations, in all matters that arise in the team,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
in the group, in the company,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
he always has a critical feedback.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
This is a person, as a rule, who has a very high intellect.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
It is clear that if the intellect was not high,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
the person would be a critic,

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
he would be just an aggressive person.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
And when a person has a high intellect and, at the same time,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
he criticizes, it is more appropriate to call him

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
a critical controller.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Probably, there were such people in the team,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
and not only in the team.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
What can be a choice for an assessor controller?

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Probably, measure with a micrometer, mark with chalk,

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
chop with an ax.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Do everything carefully.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
The next role in the team is a quality guarantor.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
I pay attention to the lexical meaning of the word.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
A person who performs his work very well.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
I emphasize, his work.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
It will be a person who is an introvert,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
whose energy is directed inside him.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
He is very attentive and detailed to the smallest details.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
He always completes the task.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
He can be assigned any task,

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
and you can forget about it,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
because he will always do it.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
He always delegates the tasks assigned to him to other people.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Why?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Because he always doubts the effectiveness

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
of the work of other people compared to himself.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
He is not a team player,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
but at the same time he performs the assigned task

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
very efficiently and efficiently.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
What can be said about the quality guarantor?

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
Either don't take it, or finish it.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
The word coordinator speaks for itself.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
It is a person who delegates authority very effectively.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
He knows how to motivate and support other people.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
He is very confident.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
As a rule, each person has his own strengths and weaknesses.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
We will talk about it in the next course.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
People who can use, delegate,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
and encourage other people,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
their personal intellectual abilities

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
are not so high compared to an assessor or a specialist.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
It is his less powerful side.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Now you can think about

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
how to assign a role of a coordinator to a task more effectively.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
An analytical, report,

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
or a project.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Or just to connect people in one team.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
The answer is clear.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
The motto of a coordinator can be quite simple.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
A friend of his praise, you praise yourself.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
The next role in the team is an activator.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
He is a driver.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
He has a high level of energy.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
The meaning of life and work

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
is a constant overcoming of difficulties.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Where there are difficulties,

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
there is an activator.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
It is a life elixir for him.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
As with any role, an activator has his less powerful sides.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
He is a very energetic person, an extrovert.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
He is very easy to be criticized,

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
to be aggressive.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
He is very emotional

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
and often conflicts with his colleagues.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
This is his less powerful side.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
And the motto of such an activator

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
can be the words of success.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
It is an ability not to lose enthusiasm,

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
to move from one failure to another.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
The last role in the team is an idea generator.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
This is a person who is able to offer

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
original, non-standard creative ideas.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
This is his strong side.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
This is a feature and an advantage of this role.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
However, he is also quite individual,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
quite serious

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
and neglects the basic principles

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
of creativity.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
If a person is creative,

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
then all the routine work,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
all the standards,

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
all the procedures and rules

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
will be critical for him.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
There should be no boundaries in creativity.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
You can think about the stage of the development of the team.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
We talked about formation, storm,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
formation.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
The idea generator will be the most effective.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
By the way, you can think about each role in the team.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
It should be noted,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
according to Belbin and as practice shows,

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
that one person,

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
one employee in the team

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
can play several similar roles.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
It is clear that an activator and a specialist

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
are completely opposite roles.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
They cannot combine in one person.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
We talked about similar roles,

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
coordinator and activator.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
It can combine in one person.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
According to Belbin,

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
the more accurately you select

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
your team members

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
according to the above roles,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
the more effective the team will work.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Let's consider the absence

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
or excess of certain roles in the company.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
What does it affect?

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
How can it be eliminated?

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
First, look at the matrix.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Each role, which we have just described,

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
is oriented either to the task

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
to a greater extent

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
or to the team creation,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
or to the relationship.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
According to this matrix,

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
four roles, which are oriented to the task,

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
such as specialist, controller,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
guarantee of quality, generator of ideas,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
work with tasks and are more individual.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
And, accordingly, harmonizer, coordinator,

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
activator and resource finder

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
are more oriented to the relationship.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
If specialists, controllers,

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
guarantee of quality and generators of ideas

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
are selected in your team,

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
where can your team go?

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Of course, it will be ineffective

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
for one simple reason.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
It will have a poorly built interpersonal relationship.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
People will close each other only in their work.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Moreover, work can get stuck

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
not on strategic, but on tactical tasks.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
Competitors will overtake you quickly.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
Even if you have a generator of ideas,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
there will be no person in your team

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
who can build these ideas,

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
promote, convey and build relationships

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
between the three previous types.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
Or let's take another extreme.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
When you have selected a team

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
and have a good interpersonal relationship,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
it often happens when the leader

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
is quite communicative,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
he often selects people

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
who are very similar to him.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Thus, a team of harmonizers,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
activators, relations builders is selected.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
A very strong emphasis is placed

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
on interpersonal communication.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
A long time ago,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
a great phrase was said

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
that good relationships

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
don't always lead to positive business results.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Thus, a team with a good relationship

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
with the help of these roles

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
will be ineffective only because

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
people will talk and communicate nicely.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
There will be no one to work.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I will give you three examples.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Each of them has a certain

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
skew in the selection of roles.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The first example is Shmel.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
The company exists on the market

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
for about 12 years.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I'm talking about a virtual name,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
but also about a virtual business direction.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
All three examples I'm going to give

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
are from real life situations

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and real business.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I've worked with them as a consultant

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
in the reorganization of the organization

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and formation of an effective team.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Shmel has been selling telecommunications

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
for 12 years.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The main problem of this company

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
is the obviously built-up

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
competition between the team members.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
People compete with each other,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
not with their competitors.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
At the same time, there is an irresponsible

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
attitude to work and obvious gaps

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
in the organization and planning.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
When the diagnosis was made,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
the investigators were used,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
including Belbin.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
One of the most simple and effective

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
in processing the results

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
is Belbin's role in the team.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
One of the test methods was used

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
by Belbin's investigator.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
If you close the right half of the slide,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you will probably say without me

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
what roles were missing in this team

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and how we replaced them.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A person who can control

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and execute the work

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
from the beginning to the end

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
is a professional.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It is a critic, an assessment controller

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
who can give assessments

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
based on his experience.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I told you that a person with high intelligence

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
should be able to give assessments

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
based on the situation.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
As soon as the team was filled with these roles,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
it became more effective.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The competitors were surprised

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
what happened.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
The next company is Doctor.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It is a company that produces unique pharmaceuticals.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
What is the problem of this company?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The company has been in the market for 25 years.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The main problem is

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
the establishment of interpersonal communication

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
that provides for the interaction of the departments.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Unique pharmaceuticals

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
are in the only implementation in Russia.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
There are good partnership relations

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
with Europe and Asia.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
People produce their own pharmaceuticals.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
There are no competitors in the Russian market.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The main problem is the absence of certain roles.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Very complex interpersonal communication.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
As soon as the team was filled with the necessary people,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
the coordinator, harmonizer and activizer were added.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
The team became more effective.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
What is more effective?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
The idea generator

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
who calmed down without interpersonal communication

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
began to generate more ideas.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
The ideas became more vivid,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
more advanced

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and more effective.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
The interpersonal communication

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
was built differently.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The third company is

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
IT solutions development

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and their sales to partners.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The company has been in the market for 10 years.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
The main problem is

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
the duplication of functions.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
IT specialists work there.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
The functions are duplicated

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and are often focused on non-urgent

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and non-important tasks

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and not on strategic ones.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
When the company was measured,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
the diagnosis was made

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
that there were not enough creative people

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
who could extract resources

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and generate creative ideas.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
After some time,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
the company did not immediately bring two people

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and broke all sales records.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Remember the curve of change I showed you?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
When new people and new roles join the team,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
the team experiences this stage of change.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The team must be ready

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
to face the fact that

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
people who have lived in the same way

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
for a long time

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and when at least one new person joins the team

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and if he plays another role,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
all the team members experience this stage of change.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
The efforts of you as a leader

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and a manager

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
should be tripled.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
However, I think that at every stage

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
the efforts of a leader are the same.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Dear listeners,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
let's sum up the roles in the team.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
You have just listened to a short excursion

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
about 8 roles in the team.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I remind you that you can use

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
the existing surveyors.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You can share them with your team members

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and they are easily processed.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Thanks to them you can see the profiles of your people.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The surveyor marks the leading and secondary role

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
of each player of the team.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
According to the managers of the teams

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I work with for a long time,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
the surveyors are needed for the first and second iterations.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Then a person gains experience,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
and without using the surveyors

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
he or she intuitively starts to calculate people

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
by their roles in the team.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Even during the selection of the personnel

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
when they conduct interviews with their candidates

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
they understand that at this stage

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
the harmonization of relations is missing.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Therefore, during the selection

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
when the team is looking for specialists

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
they pay attention to the qualities

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
that are characteristic of harmonization of relations.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I repeat, even without the existing surveyors.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I remind you that they are available on the market

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and you can use them.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The last part is the feedback.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
If we go back a few steps

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
to the beginning of the course

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
when we talked about insufficient and excessive leadership

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I noticed that your attention was focused

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
on the fact that you need to communicate with your subordinates

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
constantly.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
The problem is that we don't always know

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
how to give the right feedback.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
We have a mentality of communication

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
of the post-Soviet space.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
When a person or a subordinate makes a mistake

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
or acts in the wrong direction

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
we usually express our indignation and comments to him.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He or she listens carefully

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and says that he or she will not repeat this mistake again.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I consider it a mistake

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and he or she may not consider it a mistake

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
because he or she tried.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The probability of a mistake is high.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
A person will feel emotional tension

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and emotional fear

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
because he or she is afraid

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
to make the next mistake

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
because you will call him or her again

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and report to him or her.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
There are more modern methods of feedback

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
when communication is not about me talking to you

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
but about the interaction of two sides.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The feedback is not about me expressing my comments.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The feedback is about your opinion

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and how we can fix it together

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
in order not to repeat the mistake.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
In order to effectively give feedback

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
and interact with subordinates

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
in the process of group dynamics

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
when people are at different stages

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
of change curve

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
when people feel stress

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
when they make mistakes

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
there are three basic rules.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You can see them on the slide.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The first one is to give the employee

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
an opportunity to realize his or her behavior.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
In other words

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I call my subordinate

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Fedya Ivanov

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
who is three days late

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
in order to avoid

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
repeating the mistake.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
A person who feels emotional tension

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
will continue to be late.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
There is another type of feedback.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I report that for three days

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I don't see you at your workplace.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You are late.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I want to understand what is going on.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Tell me about it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
You need to give the person an opportunity

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
to tell what is going on.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The subordinate tells you

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
that he takes his child to kindergarten in the morning.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
He can't bring it earlier

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
because the kindergarten is still closed.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
He is late for work.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
The next step is

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
to analyze the consequences of his behavior

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
together with the subordinate.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
How critical they are

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
to the business processes of my unit.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
If they are very critical

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and we analyze it together with the subordinate

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
we move to the third step

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
and agree on the consequences.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The second step is

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
to show the consequences of the behavior.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
In our case, the subordinate is late three times in a row.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I think that in my unit

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
it critically affects the business processes

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
because I have clear formal procedures.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
No employee is ever late

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
because everyone is fined for being late.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I have a right to fire an employee

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
after three official notes.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
It is critical for the person

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and for the business processes

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
because I lose a specialist.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I explain the consequences

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
of his behavior.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
We move to the third step

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
when we agree on how we will act.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I allow him to come to work at 10 am

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and he will leave at 7 pm.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Or we look for other opportunities

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and compromises.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Remember that considering the roles in the team

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
everyone perceives the opposite critical relationship

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
in a different way.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It is important to remember it.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We will talk about personalities

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and psychological states.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
This course will help you to understand

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
each person's psychological state.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
However, if we focus on the roles in the team

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
there are four doses of feedback.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
The first dose is a glass.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
People who perceive feedback critically

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
are not ready to perceive it in large pieces

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
because they close their eyes

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
and they worry about it.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
They lose self-esteem.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
The next dose is a type of people

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
who can catch not more than three points

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
of critical comments.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The previous one was just a little.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
This type of people has not more than three points

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
of feedback.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
These three points should be related

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
to each topic or three points to one topic.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
There are variations.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
However, you should not give more than three critical comments

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
to a person in a glass.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
The consequences will be the same.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
A person will close himself

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and feel a strong internal pressure.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
He will not have a trust relationship with you.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
This is important in the team.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The next dose is a barrel.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
People who can perceive feedback

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
are people with adequate self-esteem

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
who want to develop

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
and even demand it.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
They say they want to improve

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and they want to know everything.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
When you give them a large amount of feedback

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
it does not strain them

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
because feedback helps them to develop.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
It is believed that this category of employees

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
who get a barrel dose

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
with adequate self-esteem

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and the most progressive category of employees

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
is the easiest to develop.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
The last dose is a barrel.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
These are employees who can get a large amount of feedback

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and a crazy amount of feedback.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
They can say anything they want

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
and do anything they want.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You probably have such a category of employees.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
They will listen to you carefully

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and will not be offended.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
They will agree with you

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
and will not even try to correct their behavior.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
We say in Russian that it is like peas in a pod.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You say what you want

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and you will not be offended.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
You will not even try to blame the person

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
for doing something wrong.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
He will take everything as a peasant's barrel

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
and it will be impossible to observe

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the result of his work and changes.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
To give the right feedback to the right people

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
you should get acquainted with this topic

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
in the personality and psychological block.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Today we are talking about group dynamics.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Please, analyze and think about it.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
You can open your notebook.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You have a task there.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You have to give the person

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
the type of feedback

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
and the role in front of you.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Let's summarize

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
what you have learned in the course

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
about group dynamics,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
the development of the team and the role in the team.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
To build an effective team

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I listed for you 6 main points

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
with which you, as a leader

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
who builds an effective team

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
should work

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and I emphasize, constantly.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
1. Create a team role profile.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I told you how to create a team role profile.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
There are surveyors for this.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You can attract training specialists

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
who will offer you these surveyors

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
and show you how to use them,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
how to fill in, how to process

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and how to use them in the future.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
You won't need the help of external consultants.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You can do it yourself with the help of surveyors.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Your development is constant.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
When you don't use surveyors,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
you will remain professionals.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So, the team role profile.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
As soon as you have created a team role profile,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
please, analyze the missing roles

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
regarding the tasks.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
For example, the role of a doctor,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
a wire and a bumblebee.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
The missing roles in the team

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and how they affect the effectiveness of the work.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Look at the roles you lack at this stage.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
If you have monotonous repetitive tasks

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
in your department,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
the activizers and drivers

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
are not the most critical role.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
You need specialists and professionals

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
who will do it from the beginning to the end

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
in a consistent and consistent way.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The next step is

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
to decide how to replace the missing roles.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Remember what Belbin said

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
and it proves the experience

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and the practice

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that the more diverse the role profile of your team,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
the more effective the team works.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
At the same time,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
one person can perform several roles.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
If you have a critical situation

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and no one of the team members

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
can replace the missing role,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
then you need to find such a person.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It is necessary to find him

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
not because of his professional competence

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
but because of his role.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
It is necessary to find such a person

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
to perform the emotional role.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
It is important

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
to evaluate the development of your team

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
at every stage.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I want to tell you

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
that there are many approaches

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
to this in the consulting and training business.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
There are many surveyors

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and tests that help the manager

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
to determine the stage of the team development.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
The team fills the surveyor

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
in a cross-filling.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
As a result, you see

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
the stage of your team.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
We have discussed four stages.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Each stage has four management styles

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
that you need to apply.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
As soon as you identify the stage of your team development,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
you change your leadership style

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
regarding this stage.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
The sixth and the last point

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
of the algorithm

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
is to change the management style

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
depending on the stage of the team development.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
It is very important.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
We have discussed four leadership styles.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It is very important to remember them.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I hope that you have learned

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
about the group dynamics,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
the stages of the team development,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
the roles and the distribution of roles in the team.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I hope that you will find it useful

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
to work with a team

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
and to develop the team.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Your daily work will be useful for you.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It will improve the efficiency of your team

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
and will lead your company

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
to a higher competitive level.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Good bye!
