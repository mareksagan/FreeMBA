00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
One day, Hadja Nasreddin was sitting in a teahouse, drinking tea.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
A teahouse owner approached him and asked him,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Hadja, take this horse home.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
To which he replied, I don't know where her house is.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
You just lead her on the road, she will find her own house.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
The teahouse owner said.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
So Hadja did.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
He led the horse on the road, and when she was ordering,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
he made her return to the road.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Finally, the horse turned into the yard, and Hadja turned after her.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
The owner came out, and when he turned to Hadja, he said,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Sir, how did you know that this was my horse?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
To which Hadja replied, I didn't know that this was your horse.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I was just drawing her attention to the road.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
So I wanted to show you that marketing is a science that shows

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
which road successful businessmen are walking on,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
which road to profit is.

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
What is marketing?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
A little about the history of marketing.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Marketing is a fairly new science.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
The term marketing first appeared in the 19th and 20th centuries.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
In the United States, it was considered as a method

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
and organization of sales operations.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Since the 1930s, marketing has become an integrated function

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
of business activity.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
This was due to the problems that the American economy faced.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
You probably remember that in 1929, a crisis broke out in America,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
which was later called the Great Depression.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
It was the Americans who first noticed that they had learned

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
to produce so many goods, but these goods were of no use to society.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Barges were being sown in the Atlantic Ocean.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
This depression helped many businessmen to understand

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
that it is important to produce not what you can,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
but what you need.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Since the 1930s, marketing has become an integrated function

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
that unites the whole business, finance, production, management.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Since the 1960s, marketing has spread to the non-commercial organizations

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
and services.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
This is a completely new direction that is very popular in Europe,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
but has not yet captured the Russian market.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Since the 1990s, marketing has been viewed

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
from the perspective of the so-called ethical or socially responsible business.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
The first problem that marketers face is the variety of definitions.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
In scientific literature, some scientists believe that there are 2,500,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
some say that there are 5,000, and some say that there are 1,000 definitions.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Therefore, it would be very important for me to understand

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
what marketing looks like in general.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
There are four levels of marketing at the enterprise.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
The first is marketing of products, the second is marketing of the company,

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
the third is marketing of the managers, and the fourth is self-marketing.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
In English, it is called marketing yourself.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
In addition, we have to understand the context of our business.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Depending on where we work, we are more interested in industrial marketing,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
the famous B2B, marketing of consumer goods,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
the so-called B2C marketing, marketing of services,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
marketing of public and charitable organizations, or international marketing.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Recently, a lot of other marketing has appeared, which are related to technology.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
You probably heard that there is creative marketing,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
provocative marketing, classical, competitive, strategic, tactical,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
programmable, and, finally, socially responsible.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Probably some of you know the famous Kottler triad,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
which claims that, among other things,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
in a company, especially a small and medium-sized business,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
we should take care not only of classical marketing,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
but also of internal marketing and marketing of relations.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
And finally, there is another aspect of marketing

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
that interests Russian entrepreneurs today.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
This is marketing of attracting customers and maintaining customers.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Of all this set of marketing, I want to focus on one,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
which I called strategic marketing.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Unfortunately, in Russia, it pays too little attention to it,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
rather referring to the fact that there is no time,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
or wishing to get a quick profit.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
Strategic marketing is, in fact, what determines the structure of our course.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
This is the ability to segment the market,

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
choose target audiences, and position your products and companies.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
A small preamble before we start.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
In one of the kiosks of the Academy of People's Economy,

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
I bought a pen from a Japanese company called Zebra.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
This pen is no different from anything,

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
except that it smells like vanilla.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
And when a person writes a letter, he hears this smell.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
The second pen, which this company produces,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
is also very unusual.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
You can write with different colors at the same time.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
But the most interesting for me was the pen from a Japanese company called Kakuya,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
which opens in a very peculiar way.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Most of my students can never open it,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
because they are used to opening it in two ways.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Either this way, or that way.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
In fact, it opens when it breaks in the middle.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
This is what determines the success of a company in many cases.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
What happened here?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Japanese companies realized that they need to segment the market,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
look for new niches,

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
and not just sell products and try to play with the price or advertising.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
So, look at this slide.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
The first three definitions are very important for strategic marketing.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
The first is segmentation.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
In Russian, these two terms are used,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
although in English they literally mean segmentation.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
But Russian-language publications are more inclined to segmentation.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
This is the division of the market into small groups,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
each of which requires a separate marketing approach or a separate product.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
We will devote a certain part of our lesson to this topic.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
The next step is the selection of target segments,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
the selection of the target audience,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
the evaluation of the attractiveness of each segment,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
and the selection of one or more segments for the acquisition.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
And finally, the last fundamental principle is positioning.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
So, segmentation.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
The famous Kottler definition.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
The selection of a group of consumers clearly defined within the market,

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
who differ in their needs, characteristics, or behavior,

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
for the service of which certain goods or marketing complexes may be required.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I think this definition is very important to understand.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
If you see different consumers in the market,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
you should understand that they should be offered a different pen,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
or they should be processed differently to make a purchase,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
namely, to use the famous 4P in a different way.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And in order to explain to you what the importance of market segmentation is,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I would like to tell you a little about the background.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
When the restructuring processes began in Russia,

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
most companies that were engaged in business were inclined to so-called mass marketing.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
What does this mean?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
There were three segments on the market.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
One, two, and three.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
People are rich, poor, middle class,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
but the company offered the same product.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
An example of this is, for example, the famous hand-in-hand newspaper,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
which is still being produced.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
It offered advertising services, for example, real estate,

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
household electronics, cars, construction materials, and much more.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
Unfortunately, or fortunately, the market has become very dynamic,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
competition has emerged in the market,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
and many companies have realized that each segment needs its own product.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
This is how the basis of differentiated marketing appears.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
What does this mean?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
The company thinks that there are different segments,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
and they need to create their own products.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is how a lot of advertising publications appeared,

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
which advertise computers, real estate, food products, cars.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
And from hand-in-hand, the newspaper begins to experience huge problems.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
But, oddly enough, for small businesses,

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
today, they often have to limit themselves to the third level of marketing,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
which is called concentrated marketing.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
What does this mean?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I understand that I cannot serve all markets,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I cannot serve large enterprises and small ones,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I cannot serve, for example, the gas or oil industry,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
and I have to focus on one segment.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
This kind of marketing is called concentrated marketing.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
In conclusion, I can only say that concentrated marketing and differentiated marketing

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
are what gives the opportunity to survive in a company.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Massive marketing sooner or later leads to bankruptcy.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
In order to show you what segmenting gives to companies,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I would like to give an example of Johnny Walker,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
the famous whiskey, which is produced in Scotland.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Until 1980, despite its centuries-old history,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Johnny Walker was produced in one form,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Johnny Walker Red Label.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
It cost 9 pounds per liter in Great Britain.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
Despite its marketing activity, the company could not increase its sales,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
because this market is very competitive.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Since 1980, the company realized that it needed to switch from undifferentiated mass marketing

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
to differentiated marketing.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
This is how new brands are created.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Johnny Walker Red Label remains as the leading product,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
and then Black Label, Swing, Blue and Honor appear.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Please note that their prices are significantly different.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
For example, the last type of whiskey is sold at a price of 129 pounds per liter.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
The company did not increase its sales in decaliters,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
but it significantly increased profits.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
What did this show?

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
It showed that the company created that there are different consumers on the market

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
who need different products.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
For example, for daily consumption, I can buy Red Label,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
but if I go to visit, I am probably ashamed to buy a cheap bottle of whiskey.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I will most likely buy Black Label,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
but if I go to my boss for his anniversary,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
maybe I will want to buy Honor.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
The advantage of segmentation can be reflected in the example shown on this slide.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Many airlines began to create differentiated marketing,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
creating economy, business and first class tickets in their salons.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Please note that mass marketing,

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
when the company loads the plane at the standard price of the economy class,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
for example, at the price of 250 pounds,

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
it receives only 5,200 pounds of profit.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
And a company that creates differentiation within the framework of one plane,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
creating economy, business and first class,

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
receives a profit of more than 37,000 pounds on one flight.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
Thus, we come to the key element of why market segmentation is necessary.

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
I have shown you several examples that confirm that segmentation is a very important tool for increasing sales.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
But in reality, segmentation plays several more roles.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
The first one affects the image of the company,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
it shows the prospects of the company's growth,

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
and of course, it allows to concentrate resources more deeply,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
or to concentrate resources on the most attractive segments.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
The problem of segmentation is always the most difficult,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
because it is not an intellectual exercise.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Mr. Kotler, who is so popular in Russia,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
divides the market into consumer goods and industrial goods,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
suggesting that each market has its own approach to segmentation.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
If you work in the consumer goods market,

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
you may need geographical, demographic, psychological and behavioral variables for segmentation.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The industrial goods market is more complex.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Look, here are very important factors, such as demographic,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
for example, the system of organization of purchases and individual characteristics of customers.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
This is the most complex market.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Nevertheless, there is a certain rule on how to segment the market.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
My question is, first, decide what market you work in,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
and then answer the question,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
if there is a certain group of customers,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
who are different in their behavior,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
that is, they demonstrate behavioral homogeneity when purchasing your product.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Let it be called a qualitative study,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
to understand whether there are among your consumers,

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
consumers who react equally to your marketing,

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
or who make the same demands when making a purchase.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Let's move on to a small practical exercise.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Suggest your own way of segmenting the market of retail consumers.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
When I ask this question at many seminars,

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
people try to find the answer and suggest segmenting the market,

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
segmenting consumers by income, gender, age.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
In fact, this is not a very simple question.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Therefore, in order to return to it,

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I would like to show you that there is no algorithm in segmenting,

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
by which any person can make one thing and move on to another,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
and complete this process effectively.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
This is the first step.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Pay attention to the fact that I always consider in my programs

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
the segmentation of one of the very famous English companies,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
Crystal Clear, which produces lead crystals.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
This brand is considered prestigious,

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
and its products are highly valued and are mostly purchased as gifts.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
As a rule, in order to show the diversity of segmentation,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
these two examples are very clear.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
The first example

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Now look at the answer to the first question.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Look at how retail networks segment their consumers.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Oddly enough, two factors are very important for them.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
How often do people go to the store and how much do they buy?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Based on this, there are four main segments

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
that are important for retail networks.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Frequently and frequently buying.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
These are regular customers who come to the store

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
and on Saturdays usually buy large cartons of products for the whole week.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Frequently but rarely buying.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
These are customers who live near the stores.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
They often come in, for example, grandmothers and students,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
but unfortunately they buy little.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Rarely but frequently buying.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
People who rarely go to this store,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and unfortunately, they buy a lot,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
buying the whole cart.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And finally, the segment that is called rare and rare,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
buying or not buying at all.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
In relation to each segment,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
the company must build its own policy

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
and choose a means of engaging them in sales.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Now look at the answer to how the famous English company Crystal Clear

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
makes its segmentation.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It segments by product.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Regular gifts for various anniversaries,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
retirement, birthday, romantic dates,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
public holidays and festivals.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
The second segment is wedding gifts,

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
when young couples start buying expensive dishes for their home.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Gifts such as money, business gifts,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and presentations to stimulate sales,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
and special gifts such as prizes at sports competitions.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
This segmentation allows the company to understand

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
that if for the first three segments it is important to work with retail networks,

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
then for the last two segments direct sales are important.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
I would like to show you the segmentation of the Nokia mobile phone market.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Each of us is a buyer of Nokia,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
and when we approach the mobile phone stand,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
we are not aware of it,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
but we are a segmentation tool for the manufacturers.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Look, Nokia highlights four groups of consumers.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Buyers are oriented to style,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
buyers are oriented to image,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
businessmen and buyers are oriented to practicality.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
In each case, the company offers its own product,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
realizing that it does not leave a niche for competitors,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
in which it can work and earn money.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
At the same time, pay attention to this slide

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
and tell me what kind of buyers you are in terms of Nokia segmentation.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Segmentation in Impel.com.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
It seems to me that this is the most difficult topic,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
how mobile operators today seek to segment the market.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I put a question mark,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
because I understand that segmentation cannot be perfect.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
Nevertheless, I was convinced by the classes with different groups of listeners

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
that most of them, one way or another, pursue the following goals,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
and, accordingly, can relate to one or another group of segments.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Students are people who speak little and pay little.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
The second group is young families.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
They speak a lot, but they do not have enough money,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
and therefore they pay little.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
Entrepreneurs are people who speak a lot, but they do not have enough money,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and they pay a lot.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
The peculiarity of segmentation is that when a marketer starts this procedure,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
he must understand the following.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
It is important not only to highlight the variable segmentation,

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
but also to name the market segments beautifully.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
This is the culture of marketing.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
It is, of course, different from the financial culture or the culture of management of staff.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
Therefore, a very important element is how we name our groups of consumers.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
In the United States of America, there is a very famous magazine called Sport Illustrated.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
If we look at the Russian Internet,

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
we will notice that almost all the photos of athletes are borrowed from this magazine.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
If we look at the segmentation of the magazine market,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
we will see a lot of ideas.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
Nevertheless, this option shows how unsystematic segmentation can be.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
This is the corporate segmentation of this famous magazine.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Those who want to have fun,

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
this is the first segment that Sport Illustrated would like to offer.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Those who want to satisfy their magazine with articles,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
those who need facts about sports,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
they are offered reviews, statistics, biographies,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
and collections of sports related items.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
This magazine publishes various stories and tells about sports items.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Finally, those who need advice.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
Please note that there are several criteria for segmentation.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
It is very difficult to say why certain items were chosen.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
The consequence of such segmentation is the policy of this magazine.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
Look, Sport Illustrated, in addition to publishing a magazine with relevant articles for its readers,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
also publishes specialized publications, materials, books, video recordings, children's publications,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
and finally organizes trips to sports events.

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
I wanted to show that market segmentation often pushes companies to expand their services,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
understanding what their clients ask for.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Now about this slide.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
80% of people who come to seminars on marketing in Russia

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
are people who represent the so-called B2B sector.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Business to business.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
These are people who work in companies and, thanks to direct sales or direct work with clients,

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
sell, for example, metal, machines, accessories, and much more.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
They often ask how to segment their consumers,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and what to do when price competition increases.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
I always return to this situation by showing this slide.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
The most important thing if you want to get rid of competition and make money

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
in conditions of increasing competition is the correct segmentation.

22:04.000 --> 22:15.000
Almost 60% of companies working in the B2B sector in Europe segment the market as follows.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Those who are focused on price, those who are focused on service,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
and those who are focused on long-term relations.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
This means that such a policy should exist in Russian companies as well.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Surely, there are buyers in your company who value price very much.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
If you offer a price higher than the competitors, they will most likely turn to the latter.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Therefore, you should understand that if you think that this segment is important to you,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
and you want to sell it,

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
you should offer a low price and a minimal set of services and functions.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
The second segment is those who are focused on service.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
These are buyers who are ready to overpay if you provide delivery,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
training, payment time, or something else.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And finally, the third segment, which is very important, at least in Europe,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
is those who are focused on long-term relations.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
As a rule, large companies, for example, factories that produce cars, household appliances,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
are interested in their suppliers being reliable.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
In this regard, their price may be of greater interest to a lesser extent.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
How ready are you to produce the first reliable, the second high-quality product,

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
and how stable are you ready to deliver this product, for example, to the conveyor, exactly on time?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Look at this slide.

23:45.000 --> 23:52.000
I think it is very important for describing the segmentation in the B2B sector.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
This is a study by McKinsey, a steel consumer.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
How do they choose their suppliers?

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
Please note that McKinsey also refers to the fact that there are 30 types of segments in this industry,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
clients who are focused on price, services, and long-term relations.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
If we take the criteria of the assessment of 1 unimportant, 4 important, 4-point system,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
you will notice that each segment sets its own requirements.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
Each segment of the buyer offers its own requirements for the supplier.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
For example, the lowest price, you see, is of interest to the first segment,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
this is a segment that is focused on price.

24:36.000 --> 24:45.000
Companies with so-called interest in services are more interested in other aspects than price

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
and are ready to pay at a higher price.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Please note that for those who buy at a low price,

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
and in Russia this is a mass of small and medium-sized enterprises,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
for example, buying the same metal,

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
are interested in instant response, timely delivery.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Companies that are primarily interested in services,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
instant response is very important for them,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
that the product is in stock, timely delivery,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
and client-orientedness during the conclusion of the deal.

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
The next slide shows that there are several more criteria for buyers in the B2B sector.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
For example, the short delivery time, how long the product should be delivered.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
I have noticed that companies that are focused on services would like to receive it on time.

25:40.000 --> 25:47.000
And to a lesser extent, these companies are interested in technical support

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
or, for example, loyalty to the industry,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
that is, the commitment of the manufacturer to this industry.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Please note the following factors.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Companies that are interested in long-term relations,

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
are generally interested in developing their supplier.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
Therefore, it is important for them how much the supplier is interested in research,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
in private scientific investments in them,

26:13.000 --> 26:25.000
whether they are ready to support their supplier with various kinds of technical consultations.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
And for them, of course, loyalty to this supplier is very important,

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
namely, how long do you, as a supplier, expect to work in this industry,

26:38.000 --> 26:46.000
or are you ready to leave this industry at any given moment and find a better application for your finances.

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
I would like you to ask the following question based on the results of my short lecture.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
Can you describe the products for each segment?

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
What does it mean?

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
The materials, the workbook that is offered to our CD allows you to do the following.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
First, try to choose market segments.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Second, you should evaluate market segments.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
You will see a system of criteria that is offered within the framework of my course.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
But the third aspect is very important when you do, for example, segmentation exercises.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
You should say what the product should look like, the product for this segment.

27:34.000 --> 27:43.000
This means that you cannot sell one product to pursue the goal of mass marketing.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
The product for each segment means not only the basic product,

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
but also the whole service that provides a timely supply to the client.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
Please, think about how you design your product.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
A little hint.

28:01.000 --> 28:09.000
I would like you to understand that a segment focused on price will never buy a product if the price is high.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
So, offer this product to it, but remove this product from all the loads that are possible.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Make it basic.

28:18.000 --> 28:27.000
For segments focused on quality, service and long-term relationship, there should be other products.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
It is very difficult to imagine for a company that sells metal,

28:32.000 --> 28:40.000
which does not even see the difference between the fact that there are buyers from one and the other segments.

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
The segmentation of the market is a very important element.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
The segmentation that Mr. Kotler offers is more famous in Russia.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
He segments consumers by classes.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
For example, the upper class, the middle class, the lower class.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
In addition, each class has its subgroups.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I would like to say that Mr. Kotler is very diverse.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
For example, here I am bringing the so-called segmentation of the upper class,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
which was developed by English marketologists.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
Please, note that in this segmentation there is also a division of income for people,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
in accordance with where they live.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
Nevertheless, for me it is also very important how marketologists call these segments.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
The traditional American approach of the upper, middle or lower class

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
is broken down into very creative names of segments.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
The people who succeed, in England, they are 19.8%,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
the people who expand, they are a little more than 11%,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
the people who grow, the people who are stable, who strive and who make their way.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
I always ask my students,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
where do you see yourself in this segmentation?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
The segmentation of the upper class is very creative,

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
because it allows to understand that each of the groups consumes different products,

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
reads different newspapers, visits different places of rest.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
The final task of this course.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
When I say that you are doing market segmentation,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I would like you to realize the following.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Market segmentation is not some kind of intellectual exercise

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
that allows you to understand that there are rich and poor clients,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
there are large and small enterprises.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Segmentation is a tool that shows the company,

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
in fact, the shareholder often, how we can increase sales.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
Therefore, I say that the key task of this topic is the following.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Segment your consumers as you like.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
For this, read a textbook or think about how it looks in real life.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
Next, formulate the goals for each segment in the context of increasing sales.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
What does this mean?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
What do you want to get from this segment?

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
Increase sales, or save current sales, or, on the contrary, reduce sales.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
And third, you must determine the key factor of impact on this segment.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
What does this mean?

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
How can marketing influence this segment to achieve the goal?

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
To tell the truth, when I talk about this approach to segmentation,

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
I mean that every company should have its own marketing policy.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
Once I had to face an unusual situation in Russia.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
One of the listeners of my seminar came to the seminar and said

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
that her new general director demanded a marketing policy from her.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
She asked me what a marketing policy is.

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
Looking into her eyes, I said that a marketing policy is this slide.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Because your director would like to understand

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
if there are any differences in the buyers of your products

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
and how the company affects each of these buyers.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
If you don't have this task, consider that you don't have a marketing policy.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Rather, you have a domestic policy,

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
related to various types of shares and manipulations of the assortment or price.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
But you don't have a marketing policy.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
The most interesting, I think, from the point of view of analysis,

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
choice of target segments, is the model that was proposed by the British Deep Simkin.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
It is called ABC method.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
This method is very unusual for Russians,

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
because it shows the following system of assessments.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Any company has sales volumes in a given segment.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Sales volumes can be high, medium or low.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
The company receives a margin from the sale of its products in the segment.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
It can be low, medium or high.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
If you look at this slide,

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
the ideal marketing happens when you choose segments in such a way

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
that the maximum sales come to the segment that brings the highest margin.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
And the minimum sales come to the segment that brings the minimum margin.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
This is called ABC method.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Look, ABC method in the performance of Deep Simkin

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
is a little different from the traditional one.

33:45.000 --> 33:51.000
So, the task of marketing is to choose segments that bring the maximum margin

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
and provide the maximum sales in this segment.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
Then, to find a segment that brings the average margin and provides the average sales.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
And finally, the segment that brings us the minimum margin

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
should take up a very small share of our sales.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Unfortunately, when we discuss this model at seminars,

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
I pay attention to the fact that business in Russian companies is built the opposite way.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It's a kind of mirror.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
As a rule, the volume of sales for products that bring the minimum margin is the maximum.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
And where the products are sold with a high margin, there is almost a minimum sale.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Imagine this situation in this way.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm asked, how can it be otherwise?

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
I remember a very funny story that a student told me.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
At one of my courses, she said,

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
buying expensive and selling cheap is the easiest thing.

34:52.000 --> 35:01.000
But learning to sell expensive and buy cheap is the art of business.
