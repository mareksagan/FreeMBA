00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, dear colleagues. My name is Olga Nikolaevna Zabira.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I have been a director of the staff for more than 11 years.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
I have been working as a staff member since 1989.

00:15.000 --> 00:26.000
I actually came to the business right after it was announced that private enterprises could be created in November 1988.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
I can say that I have been working in the private sector since the very beginning.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
Everything we are going to discuss today is very close to me and is very important for my practice.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
The topic of our conversation today is the person in the organization and the function of motivation.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
We will only start the function of motivation with you.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
The topic of motivation is only the basis, because it is an endless topic that can be discussed a lot.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
It is a topic that is of great interest and attention of listeners and managers.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
It is a topic that is constantly discussed in any organization.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
So, let's start with our first topic â€“ the person in the organization.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
The person in the organization and the organizational environment.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What is it?

01:21.000 --> 01:32.000
You know very well that any of us, wherever we are, is in the organizational environment.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
We will talk about this environment today.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
People work in any organization, and, of course, the communication between people in the company is very important.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
This communication is carried out through the structure, through the corporate culture that exists,

01:51.000 --> 02:01.000
whether the company is aware of it or not, and it also greatly affects the style of management, the style of management.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
The establishment of interaction between people in the organization, mutual expectations.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
The person in the organization, what the person expects from the organization, and what the organization expects from us, from those who came to work there.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
The gap between the requirements for a person who occupies a certain place or position and its potential, in fact, efficiency.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
We come to the organization and count on something.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
The organization, when hiring us, naturally expects some of our strong sides.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Do they match or not?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Carefully selecting personnel.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
This is, of course, also a very important issue, and it directly flows from the previous one.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Our expectations.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Did it match or not?

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Am I a person from the organization? Is this my company or not?

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Hiring, mentorship, guidance, putting in place a position.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
These are important things for any employee who has just joined the company.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Group values we will consider with you.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
The influence of informal groups, role distribution.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
And, finally, the topic of infinite motivation.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
But we start with the topic of the person in the organization.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
The person and the organizational environment.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
What is an organization?

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
It is a group of people for achieving a goal.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
What are the characteristics of an organization?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Any organization has goals.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
What types of organizations exist?

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Let's start with the fact that we are already born, we get into a certain organization, which is called a maternity home.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Then there is a kindergarten, a school, a pioneer organization, an institute, a university.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
For example, let's take the Moscow State University.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
This is an old, well-known organization with its own rules, with its own culture, world fame.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Such organizations as, for example, a football team.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes, this is also an organization with its own structure and with its own culture.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
Naturally, with its members, with its various groups, formal or informal leaders.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Any organization has a structure and a culture.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
The structure of the organization can be completely different,

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
because it depends on what kind of activity the secret company is conducting.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
And, of course, the existence of connections between the members of the organization

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
and certain rules that exist in the organization is different from one organization from another.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
Constant interaction with the environment are the external factors that affect any organization.

04:54.000 --> 05:03.000
Also, the presence and use of resources, that is, motivation, internal motivation in every existing organization.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
The organizational structure. What is it?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Let's think, remember.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
Each of you works in some company, in an organization that has its own unique structure.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
Although, we can say that, in principle, all organizations are built exactly the same.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
There is a management or general manager or company owner.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
There are managers of the first, second, third level.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
There are employees who perform certain functions.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
There are departments, sub-departments.

05:40.000 --> 05:50.000
But the organizational structure in any company determines the compatibility between various functions.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Not positions, but functions.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Performed by employees of a particular organization.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The principle of division of labor.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Who, what and how.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
The organization is divided into three main types.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
The first type is a functional organization.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
This is the production, sale or sale, finance, procurement, marketing and other functions.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Product type.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
This is the production of any products.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
For example, the production of pipes, the production of side products for the population.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
For example, kettles, pans, beds.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Anything that can be used to produce pipes.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And the matrix organization.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
Recently, such organizations are becoming more and more fashionable, popular and necessary.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Mostly, this fashion was introduced by IT companies.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Because it is there that there are experts of functional departments.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Which are fixed behind one or several product units.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Any structure implies hierarchy.

07:01.000 --> 07:10.000
I think you all know that in any company hierarchy exists.

07:10.000 --> 07:19.000
And there are managers of the higher rank, the middle rank, supervisors, various services, various staff of other functions.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Hierarchy can be completely different.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
This is the size between the higher and the lower rank.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
For many it seems that the greater the distance between the higher and the lower rank, the steeper the higher rank.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Because they become unimaginable and unattainable.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
I can say that in 200 years of the existence of capitalism in the West, they have passed all stages.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
From very deep structures to quite small structures at their levels.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
We catch up with them with seven-mile steps.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
And we must pay tribute to the wisdom of our leaders.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
That they were not fond of the great depth of structures.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Since the business was allowed private since 1988.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And it was active since 1889.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Companies were created very small.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
There was a manager, an owner, trusted persons of the second level and employees.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
There were three levels.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Only three.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
If we consider the example of a Western company, for example, very famous as General Motors.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
In the 80s, the hierarchy of this company was 22 levels.

08:47.000 --> 08:56.000
That is, from the board of directors to the most ordinary worker, who stood on the conveyor and mounted the machines.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
There were 22 levels of hierarchy.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
From the point of view of the staff and from the point of view of career growth, this is great.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
There is a huge, high road that can overcome any American dream.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
But it turned out that this is not so great for the economy and business of the company.

09:18.000 --> 09:27.000
So, in 1980, General Motors decided that 22 levels is too much.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Too much for management, too much for the budget.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Because the higher the management, the higher the salary.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Therefore, it was decided to remove the extra levels.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
A colossal analytical work was carried out.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
And in the end, they came to hierarchy 6.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
That is, from the highest level, this is the board of directors, to the lowest, there were only 6 levels.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It is clear that the career ladder sharply decreased.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
And it turns out that it takes much more time to go from one level to another.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
From this point of view, of course, there is a big inconvenience.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.000
But from the point of view of management, from the point of view of business, from the point of view of the correct investment of money,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
it was a very correct and wise decision.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
In a way, they were pioneers in restructuring and reorganization of the company.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Now I will show you a small example.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
It is taken from the existing IT company, the Western one, not ours.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
Here, in general, in the table, please look from the left side,

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
where the name of the head and the company number, you will see all those parameters,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
according to which a special calculation is carried out.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Let's take, for example, Yevgeny Tischenko.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
He is the owner or general director of the company, level 1.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
There are 128 people under him.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Yes, a small number, but let's consider the company with such a number.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
In total, the level of managers in the organization is 6.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
What does it mean?

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
It means that there are 19 managers in the company.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
If we divide 128 by 19, we will come to the number 6.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
In total, it turns out that the hierarchy level is 6.

11:35.000 --> 11:46.000
Companies use various types of reviews to understand whether they calculated the level of their hierarchy correctly or not.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
In the West, it is called the Organizational Health Index.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Look how interesting it sounds.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
Health, that is, healthy management, correct, competent, faithful.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
There are various types of reviews for calculating such indexes.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
Each company hires consultants and they make surveyors according to this company.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
These surveyors are used once a year.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
It is desirable that one and the same surveyor be used three years in a row.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
It is carried out by all companies in the world that belong to this corporation.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
The management index of some entity and companies at the global level is calculated.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
What else can we see in this table?

12:42.000 --> 12:52.000
For example, this organizational index shows how much the staff trusts them.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
This is a very important point.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
I don't think that our business is ready for this today.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Although I know that many advanced companies are more and more inclined to such reviews.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Because they are really interesting.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Are the managers properly equipped?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Do the right people manage the company?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Do the staff trust them?

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Because it is trust that builds efficiency.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
The efficiency of people, their dedication, their involvement, their work.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
Many companies in the West have their own different parameters.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
The company that is presented here, I will not name its name,

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
but they believed that if the index is below 74,

13:37.000 --> 13:46.000
it is worth considering whether the person is standing at the helm of the whole company or a department.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
They took such things so seriously.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
And this is part of the corporate culture of the company.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
We will talk about corporate culture now.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And we will talk very seriously.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Because when you are chosen,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
and you choose the company in which you would like to work,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
the company of your dream, the employer of your dream,

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
the question is why you want to work in a particular company,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
most people will answer,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I like it because it has an image.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Why is it such a good positive image?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Because people are comfortable there.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
Because the culture of relationships in the company is built in such a way

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
that a person wants to work, be effective, be the best,

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
help the company, succeed together with yourself.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Naturally, the company depends on the people it hires,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
and we depend on the companies we go to work for.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Therefore, when choosing a company,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
the employer's work must be very careful,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and during the interview, you are asked questions,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
but you must also ask about the company and ask deep questions,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
including about corporate culture.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
So, what is corporate culture?

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
It is a system of values and methods of solving problems

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
that lead an organization to success.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
It is a system of values and methods of solutions

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
that form in employees

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
and employees,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
the consciousness of belonging to a certain culture.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
How much are banks different in their culture from these companies,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
from pharmaceutical companies

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
or from such large manufacturers as Pepsi or Coca-Cola?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Everything is absolutely different.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
How much are the companies of oil and gas mining industries different?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
There is absolutely their own culture,

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
which has been created consciously or unconsciously for years and decades,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
but it exists in these companies.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Every successful company forms,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
not unconsciously, but consciously,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
influences the culture that exists in the company,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
improves it,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
and sets some standards.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
The slide does not show a mother and a child by chance.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Corporate culture is the child of any company.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
So, every successful company forms its own,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
unique corporate culture.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Any bank differs from another bank

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
by its unique corporate culture.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
In some bank you will be very comfortable,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and you will want to work there forever,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
until retirement, and as long as possible.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And in some bank, for example,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
you will be ready to leave even without waiting for the end of the probation period.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Because probation period is not only for an employee,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
it is also for a company.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
We choose, and we are chosen.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
So, corporate culture is the environment

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
in which any person, any of us,

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
gets into the organization in which he or she joins.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
What types of corporate cultures,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
or models, as they are called,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
exist in the relations between individuals?

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Before I talk about this topic,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I will say that today in Russia

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
there are no types of corporate culture

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
that are inherent in our Russian companies.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
If we remember that capitalism is 200 years old,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
and in our country it started, roughly speaking,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
in the 90s,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
and the construction of companies,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
structuring continues,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and this is, of course, very important,

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
because the base that was created

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
for decades, centuries in the West,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
we take it over,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
we digest it,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and we create something of our own.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
We look at all the best that is in the West,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
we discard everything that is not suitable for us,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
we absorb everything that we can use for ourselves,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
use for our business,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
for its efficiency.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
So, in order to know what we need for our efficiency,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
we will look at what the West has come to,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
what they have developed,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
and how applicable it is to them.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
Such co-founders of the issue

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
of developing types of corporate culture,

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
such as Charles Handy, Jan Harms, or Harrison,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
are very famous in the West.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Charles Handy is a very old man,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
of advanced years,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
his books are bestsellers on this topic,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
and they are written in a very informal,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
very funny way,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
about the most serious things.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Corporate culture.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
What types of corporate culture exist?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Today, in Russia,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
the types of corporate culture are not yet defined,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
purely our, Russian,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
because our business started, roughly speaking,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
17 years ago,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
since the 90s.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Therefore, everything I will talk about now

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
is the Western experience.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
The experience of 200 years of development of capitalism in the West.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
We had a short break for 80 years,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
we have now returned to the path we were walking on.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
We are catching up,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
using all the best that they have developed.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
All the mistakes that were made,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
we leave them,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
trying not to make our own very serious,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
but, in any case, to move forward.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
So, in order to move forward,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
you need to understand what you need to start from.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
What types of corporate culture exist?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
The main developers of corporate culture

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
as a concept,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
as a culture itself,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
as an influence on the life of an organization,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
are Harrison, Handy and Harms.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Charles Handy is the most famous of them.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
He is the founder and HR,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Human Resources,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
HR,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
that is, the serious work with the staff

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
that takes place in companies.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Today, more and more of this is being implemented in Russian companies.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
He was also the founder of the corporate culture theory,

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
which he took from practical examples,

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
from those companies that existed on the market

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
and which he analyzed.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
So, there are four types of corporate culture.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
What are they?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
The first one is the role culture.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
A single center of power and control,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
a coordination council,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
or a board of directors,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
or a collegium, or a board of directors,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
as you like to call it.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
There are a lot of different options.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Such a management system is combined

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
with sufficient freedom in places.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
A corporate center manages divisions or branches

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
not through operational interference,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
but through the creation of common rules and standards.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
RAUS, Gazprom, large network banks,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
large manufacturing companies,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
where production is distributed in different regions,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Western structures such as Microsoft,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Hewlett-Packard,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
such as Coca-Cola and Samsung,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
and many others.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
These are the largest corporations

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
that through rules and standards

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
manage branches, divisions,

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
and many other names of subsidiary enterprises.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
The main management mechanisms of the center

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
are strategy,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
yes, it is not given away,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
to develop in places,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and budgeting.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
What is bad about it?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Lack of flexibility.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
If you feel that something needs to be changed quickly,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
then there will be more profit and efficiency,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
it is extremely difficult to do this in a short time.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Because the rules and standards that exist

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
include paper,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
how much time is needed

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
to bring one or another decision to life.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
This company needs a very stable market,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
very stable conditions,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and naturally,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
they have little creativity.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
But in such large companies

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
it is very dangerous to be creative,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
because this creativity

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
can lead to great financial losses.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
What are the success criteria

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
for such companies?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What are the criteria for success?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What are the criteria for success?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
What are the criteria for success

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
for such companies?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It is a well-established functional work.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Screws,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
functions,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
that is, people, functions.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Communication.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Communication is only written.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Moreover, this communication is written

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and saves in many situations.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
If you have a written permission or refusal,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
for you it is an indulgence,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
it is protection in any checks

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
of the center, in any audits.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
What are the main functions of the leaders?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
They monitor the implementation

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
of the rules and regulations,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
that is, the rules and standards

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
adopted in this company

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
of the role culture.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
They manage the processes of people

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and really

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
these people

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
are given to show themselves.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
These companies are hierarchical.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
We have considered

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
an example about General Motors.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
There are 22 companies

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and 6 companies.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
In these companies the depth is not 6.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
It may not be 22,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
but it may be 18,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
15, 12,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
but not less.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
This is a really large hierarchy.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Again, plus there is

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
a great career growth

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
and it is absolutely understandable

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
to any person.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The next type of culture is

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
the culture of tasks or the culture of achievements.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
The center of power is based

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
on the competence of knowledge.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
These are not large corporations,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
although today,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
for example,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
if we take a corporation like Microsoft,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
it was created

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
as a culture of tasks

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and achievements.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
It is based on the competence

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
of the company owner

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and on his knowledge

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
of a certain product.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
It is a rapidly changing

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
organization.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Indeed, it is changing rapidly,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
adapting to the changing market.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
This is a high flexibility

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and a large energy consumption,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
enthusiasm.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It is good to have

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
such enthusiasm,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
but not for long.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
People get tired quickly.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
As a rule, in such companies people work

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
for a maximum of 3-5 years.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It is almost impossible to keep up with the pace.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
But the experience that people acquire

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
working in such companies

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
with the culture of tasks and achievements

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
is simply amazing.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
These are people who leave such companies

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and say,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I am not afraid of anything in this life.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
After that, I can work

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
in any company with any culture.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I am not afraid of anything.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The criteria of success of this culture

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
is the performance of super-tasks.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
You see, super.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It is not just functional

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
tracking, it is a super-task.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I have to do what I can't

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
and I am sure that it will not work.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It will work. Do it. Go ahead.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Communication, again, is only written.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Leaders.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Leaders are gurus, professionals.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
They unite

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
the same enthusiasts,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
the same fans of their work

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and are

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
ideological inspirers.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Who works in such companies?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
These are people who

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
are very professional

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
in a specific area.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Because they need to

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
perform specific tasks

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
and achieve certain results.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Very tough structure,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
very tough company,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
a lot of enthusiasm,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
a lot of energy.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
It is rare to be able to last longer than 5 years.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
But on the other hand,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I will repeat once again,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
a colossal experience.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The culture of personality, of a person, of support.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It sounds good if we compare it to the previous one.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
The previous one was almost a juice press.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You were squeezed out of yourself and you are free.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And here is such a good company.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
The center of power, skills

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
and potential of individual workers.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It is difficult to manage such an organization

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
because

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
such individual workers,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
who are professionals,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
who are

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
truly unique employees

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
in their knowledge, in their skills,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
they do not recognize any power over themselves.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
They simply do not submit to anyone.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
The criteria of success

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
is the realization of the potential of employees.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
That is, I came to realize.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Communication is more verbal than written.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Leaders see the potential,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
direct,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
develop the worker correctly.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Everything depends on his skills,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
achievements

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and colossal self-development,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
self-improvement.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
In principle, this is also an IT business.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Look how interesting the previous IT business company is.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And this IT business company.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You can also give examples

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
from other businesses.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
In this case,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
we will stop at the IT sector.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Two different cultures,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
two in one sector,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
in one area.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Why?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Small companies,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
which are created

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
with the owner-enthusiast,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
who has the same enthusiasts,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
colleagues,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
institutional allies,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
who have

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
colossal potential,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
internal capabilities,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
want to self-realize,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
earn money,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
close a project,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
implement something.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
They support each other.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Such enthusiasts create such companies

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
with the culture of a person's personality.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And most importantly,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
support, trust in each other.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And the last culture is the power.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The unified center of power and control.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
The owner,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
he can be the chairman of the board,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
he can be the general director.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
He does not recognize people who can replace him,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
does not pass the reins of the board.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
By the way, there are a lot of such companies in Russia now.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And I think

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
that such companies are heard by everyone

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
by the names of the owners,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
which we know.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Banks,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
which are associated with the owners,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
some gas companies,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
which are engaged in development,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
IT companies,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
some other types of business,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
which are associated with the owner.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Because he is a leader,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
he is an initiator, an inspirer,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and he is a strategist.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
All in one person.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
It's very hard.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
These people are young,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
they are 35 to 50 years old.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
They started from the moment of the market rise,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
somewhere 15, 17,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
maybe 10-12 years ago.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
They do not pass, do not delegate anything.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Companies can be

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
from 50 to 1,500 people.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And everything is concentrated in one hand.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Pros.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
High competitiveness in complex market conditions.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Cons.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Abuse of power for personal purposes.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But I will say that today

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
in Russia these cons are practically not visible.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Because these people

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
who are in power in their own company,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
they do not abuse this power.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Success criteria.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Only the result.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I do not care why not.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I care about the result.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Communication.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
In these companies,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
correspondence is considered

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
a bad tone.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
What are you writing to me?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Couldn't you come and say?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
A person has no time to read.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
He concentrated everything on himself.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Such people need to call, say.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Of course, there is a fear that he will simply forget

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
that he was called and said something.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Therefore, as a council,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
for any such conversation,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
you need to send a letter

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
according to our agreement.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
During such a telephone conversation,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I confirm,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
the managers establish absolute control

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
over their subordinates.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Loyalty.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Such companies have a very strong security system.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It is not only in Russia, but also in the West.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
The same polygraph

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that was actively discussed

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
is used in the West.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It is not considered a breach

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
if a person has passed the polygraph

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
before he was hired.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
For example, in a bank.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
The employee

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
depends on the attitude

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
of the manager.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Is it good or bad?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It depends on how you have

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
developed relations with your manager.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We have today,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
of course, much more,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
but four main types

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
of corporate culture.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
There are a lot of developments

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
in corporate culture in the West.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Therefore,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I will draw your attention

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
to a small

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
American model.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
If it was more

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
European,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
then it is American.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
There are also four types here.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Academy, club,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
baseball team.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
This is generally pure American.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And fortress.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Academy.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Who is hired

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
in such a company as an academy?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Candidates for the vacancy position

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
of managers are young employees

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
who undergo a very serious

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
professional selection.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
As a rule, testing and not one,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
with a very narrow specialization.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Pay attention once.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
American, because the narrow specialization

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
is inherent in Americans.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
They have lawyers

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
who know article 23, paragraph A.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
And paragraph B is, please,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the next door, another room.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It seems funny to us,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
because our education is very broad.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
We can really

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
give advice from different areas.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
We are theoretically more prepared.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But they have such an approach.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Right or not,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
it's hard to say.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Just such a culture.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Candidates who successfully

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
pass such exams are hired

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
as interns' managers.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And they have a special program.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Huge money is invested

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
in training such managers.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Of course, there is a danger

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
that some of them will leave.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The competitors will leave,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
other companies will leave.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It will be just thrown money.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
But the budget is so interesting

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
that more than 2% remains to work

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
in the company, because they are motivated

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
by a career, they are motivated by a salary.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The club itself

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
already feels closed,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
elitist,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
something where you would like to get.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The selection is based on experience,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
work and knowledge.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
If young, energetic, ambitious

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
are hired in the Academy,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I want, I can,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I was created for this,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
then here, behind your shoulders,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
there are such and such projects,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
you have such and such experience,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
you can pass it on to us.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
How much are employees ready

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
to sacrifice their interests

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
for the sake of the company,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
for the sake of the organization?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Unlike the Academy,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
here the preparation of wide-profile managers is carried out.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
There, remember, narrow specialization,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
here is a wide profile.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
The manager, for example,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
in the sales department can be transferred

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
to the managers, for example,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
in the marketing department, and vice versa.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And, for example,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
pharmaceutical companies are quite different.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Well, with a little digression,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
you need to have a medical education

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
to work in sales and marketing.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
There are nuances in any closed club.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And in order to get there,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
you need to have at least a proper diploma

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
in education.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
The fourth option is a baseball team.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Well, for the Russian version,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I don't know how to call it,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
football, it's hard to compare with our football,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
we are not very successful.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So far, there is no analogy,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
maybe you will come up with something.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
What people are selected

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
by such companies,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
focused on success?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It is very similar to the Academy.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Energetic, ambitious.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Age does not matter.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Wow, how great!

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Finally, people after 40-45

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
can send a bold resume

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
to such a company,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
where they do not write

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
that people under 30 are accepted,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
and above 30 do not send a resume.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The potential of the employee

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
is of particular importance.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And pay attention to the aggressiveness.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Probably such companies

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
are mostly engaged in sales.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It is the sellers

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
who should be absolutely aggressive,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
uncontrolled,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
emotional,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
because otherwise

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
it is impossible to sell anything.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The ability to take risks.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
As a rule, employees have very broad

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
powers and freedom of action.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
But they beat for violating

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
some things and not bringing

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
results is very painful.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
In such organizations,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
alas, there is a lot of liquidity,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
because it is a big sport.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And if you ran,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
you have to run to the end.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But did you calculate your breath

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
and your strength or not?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
This is your personal business.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
People from such companies

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
literally fall out,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
like in sports,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
unfortunately, often in the hospital.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Therefore, again, choosing a company

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
or analyzing

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
what company I work for today,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
be very careful.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Measure your capabilities

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
with the requirements that the company

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
presents to you, inviting you to work.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And the last strength sounds good.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
A large number of organizations

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
at one stage of their development

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
are in a state of stagnation.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
A very familiar word.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Such organizations do not develop,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
but try to survive.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
We came out of this period

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
of socialism, of stagnation,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
as we called it when we survived.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
But it turns out that there are

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
such companies in capitalism.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That is, it is quite likely that

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
in a few decades our Russian business

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
may grow to such companies

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
that will be similar

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
to the fortress.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Why do people attract such companies?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Because they are quiet and stable.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
This word to sit down,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
yes, you can sit down in them.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
On the contrary,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
these companies do not attract

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
aggressive people

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
who challenge fate.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And, in fact,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
it will be boring for them.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It is almost impossible

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
to create something new in this company.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
In the process of forming a corporate culture,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
such an organization

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
could develop

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
according to any of the above.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
An academy, a baseball team

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
or a club.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
But at one point something happened,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
or the company achieved its highest results,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
and it turns into a fortress.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Or so the situation happened

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
on the market,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
on the market

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
where one or another company played,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
according to internal and external factors,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
that this organization

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
stopped developing

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
and fell into a state of stagnation.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
A few more words

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
about corporate culture.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Actually,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
in some companies there is a culture,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
in some there is not.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I don't even know where I work,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
is there any culture or not.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Try to think.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
If you like the company you work for,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
think about

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
why you like it.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
People. What people?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I work because I like the people

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I work with.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Observe what people.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I like the attitude

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
of leadership to us,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
between people, between departments.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And what are the disadvantages?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
The general advantages.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The formed corporate culture

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
supports the commitment of employees

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
to the company's values.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
In a company with a strong corporate culture

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
employees are highly valued.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
And those employees who are ready

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to contribute

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
to the efficiency

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and development of the company.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
The corporate culture defines the rules of the game

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
in any situation in business.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Rules are written in any situation.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
If this is the case,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
then you should act this way.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
If not, then like this.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
The rules.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
The rules punish the violation of the rules.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Disadvantages.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Sometimes a strong corporate culture

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
can be an obstacle

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
and a necessary change.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We can't let the corporate culture

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
and standards.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
They should be changed.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And this is not a quick thing.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And, of course, different corporate cultures

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
can have a negative effect

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
on the merger.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It is very fashionable now.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You probably hear

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
that one company merges with another,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
absorption.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
But the fact that one company

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
was, for example, a company of power

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
or a role

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and merges with a company of a person

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and supports them

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
as if they were together

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
is almost like getting married.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It is very difficult.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You must calculate everything correctly.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
What else affects

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
the corporate culture?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
The natural style of management.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The head of any company

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
is the manager.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Managers are divided,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
like all of us, into men and women.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And there are

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
three main styles of management.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
If we break them down in more detail,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
there may be more of them,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
but the main three are

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
the direct,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
the authoritarian,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
the democratic

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
or the collegial,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and the liberal,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the anarchic, the nominal,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
the non-interfering,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
and the permissive.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Now let's see

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
what styles of management

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
women have.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You may have noticed

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
that women have

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
a liberal style,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
the anarchic, the nominal, the non-interfering.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Why?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
It is probably the mother's principle

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
that prevents a mother

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
from interfering in her child's affairs.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
No normal mother

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
will allow it,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
so women do not accept this style.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Look at how many women

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and only 25% of men

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
prefer the democratic style.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Why?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Women should consult

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
with their colleagues.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Men prefer

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
the authoritarian style.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Women only 30%.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
But I wonder

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
what women

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
are easier to work with?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
The authoritarian or the democratic?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Which is easier?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Which is more efficient?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The question is not empty.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
It is difficult

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
to make an analysis

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
of the Russian business,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
but if we observe the market

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and observe it

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
for another 10 years,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I think

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
we will have interesting conclusions.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
maybe we will meet

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
and share our impressions

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
on this topic.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
What styles?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Where are they effective?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Indeed,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
there is no person

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
who is purely authoritarian

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
or fully democratic.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
There are no such people.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
We all perform roles in the theatre.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Theatre is life, life is theatre.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
We play different roles.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
If the situation changes,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
we have a different role.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Today someone is Cinderella,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
tomorrow someone is a good fairy,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
the day after tomorrow Bob Yaga.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It is different.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I have changed.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Directive, authoritarian,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
in extreme conditions,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
you cannot survive otherwise.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The time limit, the management

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
should be centralized.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I decided,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I bear responsibility.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
By the way, the question of responsibility

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
is very important.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
People like to lead,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
but it is better not to bear responsibility.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Responsibility is an important element.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Democratic, standard,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
flexible conditions,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
when you can calculate,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
apply some algorithms,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
you can allow yourself

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
to fantasize about business.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And liberal.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
The liberal is ideal

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
during the merger and absorption.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
If the cultures do not coincide,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
one company

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
takes the non-interfering position.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Those who absorb them

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
most likely

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
behave authoritarily

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and those who are calm

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
sit and wait.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
It requires a lot of

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
nervous tension

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and the ability not to interfere

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and not to get out.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
A certain psychotype.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
It is important to remember

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
that, as a rule,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
in a pure form,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
none of the mentioned styles

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
is found.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
The head of the organization

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
usually has several management styles.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
External factors influence the style.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
The market,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
age of the company,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
the personality of the head,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
his education,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and the personality of the staff.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
By the way, the staff is usually selected by the head.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Therefore, look carefully

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
what your head is like,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
what styles he likes to use,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and whether he is suitable

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
for you as a head.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Or if you are the head,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
try to assess yourself

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and see how the organization is organized.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
You are a person,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
a leader or an employee

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and an organization

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
with its own corporate culture

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and different management styles.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
What else is important to remember?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
As a rule, in a pure form,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
none of the mentioned types

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
of corporate culture is found.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Not only styles, but also types.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
The organization usually has

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
not one, but several types.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Indeed, we begin to develop

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
the corporate culture as a support,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
as a task,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and in the end we can come to the type of power.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
For example,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
the corporate culture is again

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
provided by external factors,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
such as competition or new laws,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and internal factors,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
for example, the management's management,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
completely at the will of the company owner.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
What external factors,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
if we talk about it in more detail,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
exist?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
These are clients

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and service providers.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Any company,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
whatever it is,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
is created for clients.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Goods, market sales,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
you need to know the needs of those people

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
for whom you create a business

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and for whom we work.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Suppliers, of course,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
are the market resources,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
this is the price,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the availability and use of resources.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
The competition, which does not allow us

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
to sleep, rest, relax,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
limits freedom

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
for our organization.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
The game is on the same field,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
and on the same field there are so many players

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
that it becomes tight.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Why is there a merger and absorption?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because the larger the company,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
the easier it is to push

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
smaller ones out of the market.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Technology and technology,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
this is quite modern,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
but it creates a specific competitive struggle

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and at the same time

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
creates even more competition.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
The company creates more and more new products.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Let's take the IT sector,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
because new technologies are introduced there

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
the fastest.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Medicine, by the way, too.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And from one introduction to another

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
time is reduced.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
That is, more and more

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
technical progress is taking place.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
And, of course, the external factor

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
is the state.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Today we live by one law,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
tomorrow it was canceled,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
we live differently.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Maybe we need to re-register everything,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
license everything anew,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
certify.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
There is a lot of time,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
we are already starting to lose in business.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
These are the serious external factors.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
What else

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
affects a person

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
in an organization?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Naturally,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I was talking about resources,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
material and natural human resources.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And human resources

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
have the main distinguishing feature

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
is the presence of intelligence.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
The ability to constantly

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
improve.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And, of course,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
people come to the organization

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
consciously.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
These are very important things.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Motivation

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Slowly,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
we will touch

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
the topic of motivation.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Step by step, do not rush.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
We have considered

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
a person in an organization.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
That is,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
a person comes

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
to some organization

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
in which there is already

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
a corporate culture,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
there is already a certain

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
management style.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Under this corporate culture

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and style, people are selected,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
a strategy is built,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
a structure,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
a certain hierarchy,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and you get to

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
a certain hierarchy level.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
To sum up,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
we have an organization,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
we have an organizational structure and culture,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and external factors,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
which we have already talked about.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Now, one more factor.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
The use of human labor resources.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Motivation.
