00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, dear colleagues. My name is Olga Nikolaevna Zabira.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have been a director of the staff for more than 11 years.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I have been working as a staff member since 1989.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I actually came to the business right after it was announced that private enterprises could be created in November 1988.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I can say that I have been working in the private sector since the very beginning.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Everything we are going to discuss today is very close to me and is very important for my practice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The topic of our conversation today is the person in the organization and the function of motivation.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We will only start the function of motivation with you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The topic of motivation is only the basis, because it is an endless topic that can be discussed a lot.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It is a topic that is of great interest and attention of listeners and managers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It is a topic that is constantly discussed in any organization.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, let's start with our first topic – the person in the organization.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The person in the organization and the organizational environment.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What is it?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You know very well that any of us, wherever we are, is in the organizational environment.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We will talk about this environment today.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
People work in any organization, and, of course, the communication between people in the company is very important.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This communication is carried out through the structure, through the corporate culture that exists,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000
whether the company is aware of it or not, and it also greatly affects the style of management, the style of management.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The establishment of interaction between people in the organization, mutual expectations.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The person in the organization, what the person expects from the organization, and what the organization expects from us, from those who came to work there.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The gap between the requirements for a person who occupies a certain place or position and its potential, in fact, efficiency.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We come to the organization and count on something.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The organization, when hiring us, naturally expects some of our strong sides.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Do they match or not?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Carefully selecting personnel.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is, of course, also a very important issue, and it directly flows from the previous one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Our expectations.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Did it match or not?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Am I a person from the organization? Is this my company or not?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Hiring, mentorship, guidance, putting in place a position.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
These are important things for any employee who has just joined the company.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Group values we will consider with you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The influence of informal groups, role distribution.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And, finally, the topic of infinite motivation.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But we start with the topic of the person in the organization.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The person and the organizational environment.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
What is an organization?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It is a group of people for achieving a goal.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What are the characteristics of an organization?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Any organization has goals.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What types of organizations exist?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Let's start with the fact that we are already born, we get into a certain organization, which is called a maternity home.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Then there is a kindergarten, a school, a pioneer organization, an institute, a university.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
For example, let's take the Moscow State University.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is an old, well-known organization with its own rules, with its own culture, world fame.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Such organizations as, for example, a football team.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Yes, this is also an organization with its own structure and with its own culture.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Naturally, with its members, with its various groups, formal or informal leaders.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Any organization has a structure and a culture.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The structure of the organization can be completely different,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
because it depends on what kind of activity the secret company is conducting.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And, of course, the existence of connections between the members of the organization

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and certain rules that exist in the organization is different from one organization from another.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Constant interaction with the environment are the external factors that affect any organization.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Also, the presence and use of resources, that is, motivation, internal motivation in every existing organization.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The organizational structure. What is it?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Let's think, remember.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Each of you works in some company, in an organization that has its own unique structure.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Although, we can say that, in principle, all organizations are built exactly the same.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
There is a management or general manager or company owner.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
There are managers of the first, second, third level.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There are employees who perform certain functions.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There are departments, sub-departments.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But the organizational structure in any company determines the compatibility between various functions.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Not positions, but functions.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Performed by employees of a particular organization.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The principle of division of labor.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Who, what and how.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The organization is divided into three main types.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The first type is a functional organization.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This is the production, sale or sale, finance, procurement, marketing and other functions.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Product type.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
This is the production of any products.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
For example, the production of pipes, the production of side products for the population.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
For example, kettles, pans, beds.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Anything that can be used to produce pipes.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And the matrix organization.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Recently, such organizations are becoming more and more fashionable, popular and necessary.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Mostly, this fashion was introduced by IT companies.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Because it is there that there are experts of functional departments.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Which are fixed behind one or several product units.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Any structure implies hierarchy.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I think you all know that in any company hierarchy exists.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And there are managers of the higher rank, the middle rank, supervisors, various services, various staff of other functions.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Hierarchy can be completely different.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This is the size between the higher and the lower rank.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
For many it seems that the greater the distance between the higher and the lower rank, the steeper the higher rank.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Because they become unimaginable and unattainable.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I can say that in 200 years of the existence of capitalism in the West, they have passed all stages.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
From very deep structures to quite small structures at their levels.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We catch up with them with seven-mile steps.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And we must pay tribute to the wisdom of our leaders.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
That they were not fond of the great depth of structures.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Since the business was allowed private since 1988.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And it was active since 1889.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Companies were created very small.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
There was a manager, an owner, trusted persons of the second level and employees.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
There were three levels.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Only three.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
If we consider the example of a Western company, for example, very famous as General Motors.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In the 80s, the hierarchy of this company was 22 levels.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That is, from the board of directors to the most ordinary worker, who stood on the conveyor and mounted the machines.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
There were 22 levels of hierarchy.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
From the point of view of the staff and from the point of view of career growth, this is great.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
There is a huge, high road that can overcome any American dream.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But it turned out that this is not so great for the economy and business of the company.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, in 1980, General Motors decided that 22 levels is too much.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Too much for management, too much for the budget.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Because the higher the management, the higher the salary.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Therefore, it was decided to remove the extra levels.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
A colossal analytical work was carried out.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And in the end, they came to hierarchy 6.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
That is, from the highest level, this is the board of directors, to the lowest, there were only 6 levels.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It is clear that the career ladder sharply decreased.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And it turns out that it takes much more time to go from one level to another.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
From this point of view, of course, there is a big inconvenience.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But from the point of view of management, from the point of view of business, from the point of view of the correct investment of money,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
it was a very correct and wise decision.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
In a way, they were pioneers in restructuring and reorganization of the company.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Now I will show you a small example.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It is taken from the existing IT company, the Western one, not ours.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Here, in general, in the table, please look from the left side,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
where the name of the head and the company number, you will see all those parameters,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
according to which a special calculation is carried out.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Let's take, for example, Yevgeny Tischenko.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
He is the owner or general director of the company, level 1.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
There are 128 people under him.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Yes, a small number, but let's consider the company with such a number.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
In total, the level of managers in the organization is 6.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
What does it mean?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It means that there are 19 managers in the company.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
If we divide 128 by 19, we will come to the number 6.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
In total, it turns out that the hierarchy level is 6.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Companies use various types of reviews to understand whether they calculated the level of their hierarchy correctly or not.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In the West, it is called the Organizational Health Index.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Look how interesting it sounds.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Health, that is, healthy management, correct, competent, faithful.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
There are various types of reviews for calculating such indexes.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Each company hires consultants and they make surveyors according to this company.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
These surveyors are used once a year.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It is desirable that one and the same surveyor be used three years in a row.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
It is carried out by all companies in the world that belong to this corporation.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
The management index of some entity and companies at the global level is calculated.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
What else can we see in this table?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.000
For example, this organizational index shows how much the staff trusts them.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
This is a very important point.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I don't think that our business is ready for this today.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Although I know that many advanced companies are more and more inclined to such reviews.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Because they are really interesting.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Are the managers properly equipped?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Do the right people manage the company?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Do the staff trust them?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Because it is trust that builds efficiency.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
The efficiency of people, their dedication, their involvement, their work.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Many companies in the West have their own different parameters.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The company that is presented here, I will not name its name,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
but they believed that if the index is below 74,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:46.000
it is worth considering whether the person is standing at the helm of the whole company or a department.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
They took such things so seriously.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And this is part of the corporate culture of the company.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We will talk about corporate culture now.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And we will talk very seriously.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Because when you are chosen,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and you choose the company in which you would like to work,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the company of your dream, the employer of your dream,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the question is why you want to work in a particular company,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
most people will answer,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I like it because it has an image.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Why is it such a good positive image?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Because people are comfortable there.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Because the culture of relationships in the company is built in such a way

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that a person wants to work, be effective, be the best,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
help the company, succeed together with yourself.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Naturally, the company depends on the people it hires,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and we depend on the companies we go to work for.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Therefore, when choosing a company,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the employer's work must be very careful,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and during the interview, you are asked questions,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
but you must also ask about the company and ask deep questions,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
including about corporate culture.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, what is corporate culture?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It is a system of values and methods of solving problems

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that lead an organization to success.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
It is a system of values and methods of solutions

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that form in employees

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and employees,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the consciousness of belonging to a certain culture.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
How much are banks different in their culture from these companies,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
from pharmaceutical companies

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
or from such large manufacturers as Pepsi or Coca-Cola?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Everything is absolutely different.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
How much are the companies of oil and gas mining industries different?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There is absolutely their own culture,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
which has been created consciously or unconsciously for years and decades,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
but it exists in these companies.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Every successful company forms,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
not unconsciously, but consciously,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
influences the culture that exists in the company,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
improves it,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and sets some standards.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
The slide does not show a mother and a child by chance.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Corporate culture is the child of any company.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So, every successful company forms its own,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
unique corporate culture.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Any bank differs from another bank

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
by its unique corporate culture.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
In some bank you will be very comfortable,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and you will want to work there forever,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
until retirement, and as long as possible.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And in some bank, for example,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
you will be ready to leave even without waiting for the end of the probation period.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Because probation period is not only for an employee,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
it is also for a company.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We choose, and we are chosen.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So, corporate culture is the environment

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
in which any person, any of us,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
gets into the organization in which he or she joins.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
What types of corporate cultures,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
or models, as they are called,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
exist in the relations between individuals?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Before I talk about this topic,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I will say that today in Russia

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
there are no types of corporate culture

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
that are inherent in our Russian companies.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
If we remember that capitalism is 200 years old,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and in our country it started, roughly speaking,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
in the 90s,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and the construction of companies,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
structuring continues,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and this is, of course, very important,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
because the base that was created

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
for decades, centuries in the West,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
we take it over,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
we digest it,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and we create something of our own.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
We look at all the best that is in the West,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
we discard everything that is not suitable for us,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
we absorb everything that we can use for ourselves,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
use for our business,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
for its efficiency.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
So, in order to know what we need for our efficiency,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
we will look at what the West has come to,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
what they have developed,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and how applicable it is to them.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Such co-founders of the issue

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
of developing types of corporate culture,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
such as Charles Handy, Jan Harms, or Harrison,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
are very famous in the West.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Charles Handy is a very old man,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
of advanced years,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
his books are bestsellers on this topic,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and they are written in a very informal,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
very funny way,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
about the most serious things.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Corporate culture.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
What types of corporate culture exist?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Today, in Russia,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
the types of corporate culture are not yet defined,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
purely our, Russian,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
because our business started, roughly speaking,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
17 years ago,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
since the 90s.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Therefore, everything I will talk about now

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
is the Western experience.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
The experience of 200 years of development of capitalism in the West.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
We had a short break for 80 years,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
we have now returned to the path we were walking on.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
We are catching up,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
using all the best that they have developed.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
All the mistakes that were made,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
we leave them,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
trying not to make our own very serious,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
but, in any case, to move forward.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So, in order to move forward,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
you need to understand what you need to start from.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
What types of corporate culture exist?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
The main developers of corporate culture

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
as a concept,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
as a culture itself,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
as an influence on the life of an organization,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
are Harrison, Handy and Harms.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Charles Handy is the most famous of them.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
He is the founder and HR,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Human Resources,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
HR,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
that is, the serious work with the staff

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
that takes place in companies.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Today, more and more of this is being implemented in Russian companies.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
He was also the founder of the corporate culture theory,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
which he took from practical examples,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
from those companies that existed on the market

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and which he analyzed.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
So, there are four types of corporate culture.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
What are they?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
The first one is the role culture.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
A single center of power and control,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
a coordination council,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
or a board of directors,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
or a collegium, or a board of directors,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
as you like to call it.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
There are a lot of different options.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Such a management system is combined

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
with sufficient freedom in places.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
A corporate center manages divisions or branches

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
not through operational interference,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
but through the creation of common rules and standards.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
RAUS, Gazprom, large network banks,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
large manufacturing companies,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
where production is distributed in different regions,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Western structures such as Microsoft,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Hewlett-Packard,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
such as Coca-Cola and Samsung,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and many others.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
These are the largest corporations

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
that through rules and standards

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
manage branches, divisions,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and many other names of subsidiary enterprises.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
The main management mechanisms of the center

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
are strategy,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
yes, it is not given away,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
to develop in places,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
and budgeting.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
What is bad about it?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Lack of flexibility.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
If you feel that something needs to be changed quickly,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
then there will be more profit and efficiency,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
it is extremely difficult to do this in a short time.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Because the rules and standards that exist

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
include paper,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
how much time is needed

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
to bring one or another decision to life.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
This company needs a very stable market,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
very stable conditions,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and naturally,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
they have little creativity.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
But in such large companies

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it is very dangerous to be creative,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
because this creativity

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
can lead to great financial losses.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
What are the success criteria

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
for such companies?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It is a well-established functional work.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Screws,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
functions,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
that is, people, functions.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Communication.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Communication is only written.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Moreover, this communication is written

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
and saves in many situations.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
If you have a written permission or refusal,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
for you it is an indulgence,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
it is protection in any checks

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
of the center, in any audits.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
What are the main functions of the leaders?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
They monitor the implementation

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
of the rules and regulations,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
that is, the rules and standards

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
adopted in this company

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
of the role culture.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
They manage the processes of people

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and really

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
these people

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
are given to show themselves.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
These companies are hierarchical.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
We have considered

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
an example about General Motors.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
There are 22 companies

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
and 6 companies.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
In these companies the depth is not 6.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
It may not be 22,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
but it may be 18,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
15, 12,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
but not less.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
This is a really large hierarchy.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Again, plus there is

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
a great career growth

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
and it is absolutely understandable

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
to any person.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
The next type of culture is

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
the culture of tasks or the culture of achievements.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
The center of power is based

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
on the competence of knowledge.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
These are not large corporations,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
although today,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
for example,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
if we take a corporation like Microsoft,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
it was created

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
as a culture of tasks

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
and achievements.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
It is based on the competence

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
of the company owner

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
and on his knowledge

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
of a certain product.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
It is a rapidly changing

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
organization.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Indeed, it is changing rapidly,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
adapting to the changing market.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
This is a high flexibility

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and a large energy consumption,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
enthusiasm.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
It is good to have

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
such enthusiasm,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
but not for long.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
People get tired quickly.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
As a rule, in such companies people work

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
for a maximum of 3-5 years.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It is almost impossible to keep up with the pace.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
But the experience that people acquire

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
working in such companies

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
with the culture of tasks and achievements

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
is simply amazing.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
These are people who leave such companies

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
and say,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I am not afraid of anything in this life.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
After that, I can work

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
in any company with any culture.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I am not afraid of anything.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
The criteria of success of this culture

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
is the performance of super-tasks.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
You see, super.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
It is not just functional

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
tracking, it is a super-task.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I have to do what I can't

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and I am sure that it will not work.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
It will work. Do it. Go ahead.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Communication, again, is only written.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Leaders.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Leaders are gurus, professionals.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
They unite

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
the same enthusiasts,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
the same fans of their work

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
and are

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
ideological inspirers.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Who works in such companies?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
These are people who

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
are very professional

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
in a specific area.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Because they need to

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
perform specific tasks

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
and achieve certain results.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Very tough structure,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
very tough company,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
a lot of enthusiasm,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
a lot of energy.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
It is rare to be able to last longer than 5 years.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
But on the other hand,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I will repeat once again,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
a colossal experience.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
The culture of personality, of a person, of support.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It sounds good if we compare it to the previous one.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
The previous one was almost a juice press.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
You were squeezed out of yourself and you are free.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
And here is such a good company.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
The center of power, skills

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
and potential of individual workers.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
It is difficult to manage such an organization

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
because

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
such individual workers,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
who are professionals,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
who are

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
truly unique employees

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
in their knowledge, in their skills,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
they do not recognize any power over themselves.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
They simply do not submit to anyone.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
The criteria of success

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
is the realization of the potential of employees.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
That is, I came to realize.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Communication is more verbal than written.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Leaders see the potential,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
direct,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
develop the worker correctly.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Everything depends on his skills,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
achievements

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and colossal self-development,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
self-improvement.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
In principle, this is also an IT business.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Look how interesting the previous IT business company is.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
And this IT business company.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
You can also give examples

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
from other businesses.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
In this case,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
we will stop at the IT sector.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Two different cultures,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
two in one sector,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
in one area.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Why?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Small companies,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
which are created

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
with the owner-enthusiast,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
who has the same enthusiasts,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
colleagues,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
institutional allies,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
who have

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
colossal potential,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
internal capabilities,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
want to self-realize,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
earn money,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
close a project,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
implement something.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
They support each other.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Such enthusiasts create such companies

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
with the culture of a person's personality.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And most importantly,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
support, trust in each other.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And the last culture is the power.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
The unified center of power and control.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
The owner,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
he can be the chairman of the board,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
he can be the general director.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
He does not recognize people who can replace him,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
does not pass the reins of the board.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
By the way, there are a lot of such companies in Russia now.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And I think

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
that such companies are heard by everyone

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
by the names of the owners,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
which we know.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Banks,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
which are associated with the owners,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
some gas companies,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
which are engaged in development,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
IT companies,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
some other types of business,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
which are associated with the owner.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Because he is a leader,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
he is an initiator, an inspirer,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
and he is a strategist.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
All in one person.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
It's very hard.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
These people are young,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
they are 35 to 50 years old.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
They started from the moment of the market rise,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
somewhere 15, 17,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
maybe 10-12 years ago.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
They do not pass, do not delegate anything.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Companies can be

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
from 50 to 1,500 people.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
And everything is concentrated in one hand.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Pros.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
High competitiveness in complex market conditions.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Cons.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Abuse of power for personal purposes.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
But I will say that today

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
in Russia these cons are practically not visible.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Because these people

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
who are in power in their own company,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
they do not abuse this power.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Success criteria.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Only the result.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I do not care why not.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I care about the result.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Communication.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
In these companies,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
correspondence is considered

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
a bad tone.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
What are you writing to me?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Couldn't you come and say?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
A person has no time to read.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
He concentrated everything on himself.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Such people need to call, say.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Of course, there is a fear that he will simply forget

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
that he was called and said something.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Therefore, as a principle,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
for any such conversation,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
you need to send a letter

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
according to our agreement.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
During such a telephone conversation,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I confirm,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
the managers establish absolute control

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
over their subordinates.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Loyalty.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Such companies have a very strong security system.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It is not only in Russia, but also in the West.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
The same polygraph

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
that was actively discussed

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
is used in the West.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
It is not considered a breach

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
if a person has passed the polygraph

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
before he was hired.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
For example, in a bank.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
The employee

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
depends on the attitude

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
of the manager.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Is it good or bad?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
It depends on how you have

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
developed relations with your manager.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
We have today,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
of course, much more,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
but four main types

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
of corporate culture.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
There are a lot of developments

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
in corporate culture in the West.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Therefore,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I will draw your attention

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
to a small

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
American model.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
If it was more

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
European,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
then it is American.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
There are also four types here.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Academy, club,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
baseball team.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
This is generally pure American.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
And fortress.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Academy.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Who is hired

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
in such a company as an academy?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Candidates for the vacancy position

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
of managers are young employees

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
who undergo a very serious

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
professional selection.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
As a rule, testing and not one,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
with a very narrow specialization.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Pay attention once.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
American, because the narrow specialization

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
is inherent in Americans.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
They have lawyers

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
who know article 23, paragraph A.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And paragraph B is, please,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
the next door, another room.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
It seems funny to us,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
because our education is very broad.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
We can really

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
give advice from different areas.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
We are theoretically more prepared.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
But they have such an approach.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Right or not,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
it's hard to say.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Just such a culture.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Candidates who successfully

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
pass such exams are hired

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
as intern managers.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And they have a special program.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Huge money is invested

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
in training such managers.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Of course, there is a danger

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
that some of them will leave.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
They will leave for competitors,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
for other companies.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It will be just waste of money.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
But the budget is so interesting

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
that more than 2% remains to work

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
in the company, because they are motivated

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
by a career, they are motivated by a salary.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
The club itself

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
already feels closed,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
elitist,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
something where you would like to get.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
The selection is based on experience,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
work and knowledge.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
If young, energetic, ambitious

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
are hired in the Academy,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
I want, I can,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
I was created for this,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
then here, behind your shoulders,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
there are such and such projects,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
you have such and such experience,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
you can pass it on to us.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
How much are employees ready

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
to sacrifice their interests

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
for the sake of the company,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
for the sake of the organization?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Unlike the Academy,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
here the preparation of wide-profile managers is carried out.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
There, remember, narrow specialization,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
here is a wide profile.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
The manager, for example,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
in the sales department can be transferred

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
to the managers, for example,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
in the marketing department, and vice versa.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And, for example,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
pharmaceutical companies are quite different.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Well, with a little digression,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
you need to have a medical education

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
to work in sales and marketing.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
There are nuances in any closed club.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And in order to get there,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
you need to have at least a proper diploma

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
in education.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
The fourth option is a baseball team.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Well, for the Russian version,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
I don't know how to call it,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
football, it's hard to compare with our football,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
we are not very successful.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So far, there is no analogy,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
maybe you will come up with something.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
What people are selected

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
by such companies,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
focused on success?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
It is very similar to the Academy.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Energetic, ambitious.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Age does not matter.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Wow, how great!

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Finally, people after 40-45

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
can send a bold resume

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
to such a company,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
where they do not write

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
that people under 30 are accepted,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
and above 30 do not send a resume.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
The potential of the employee

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
is of particular importance.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And pay attention to the aggressiveness.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Probably such companies

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
are mostly engaged in sales.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
It is the sellers

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
who should be absolutely aggressive,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
uncontrolled,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
emotional,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
because otherwise

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
it is impossible to sell anything.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
The ability to take risks.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
As a rule, employees have very broad

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
powers and freedom of action.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
But they beat for violating

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
some things and not bringing

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
results is very painful.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
In such organizations,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
alas, there is a lot of liquidity,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
because it is a big sport.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And if you ran,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
you have to run to the end.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
But did you calculate your breath

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and your strength or not?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
This is your personal business.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
People from such companies

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
literally fall out,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
like in sports,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
unfortunately, often in the hospital.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Therefore, again, choosing a company

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
or analyzing

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
what company I work for today,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
be very careful.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Measure your capabilities

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
with the requirements that the company

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
presents to you, inviting you to work.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And the last strength sounds good.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
A large number of organizations

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
at one stage of their development

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
are in a state of stagnation.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
A very familiar word.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Such organizations do not develop,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
but try to survive.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
We came out of this period

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
of socialism, of stagnation,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
as we called it when we survived.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
But it turns out that there are

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
such companies in capitalism.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
That is, it is quite likely that

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
in a few decades our Russian business

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
may grow to such companies

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
that will be similar

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
to the fortress.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Why are people attracted to such companies?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Because they are quiet and stable.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
This word to sit down,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
yes, you can sit down in them.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
On the contrary,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
these companies do not attract

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
aggressive people

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
who challenge fate.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And, in fact,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
it will be boring for them.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
It is almost impossible

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
to create something new in this company.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
In the process of forming a corporate culture,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
such an organization

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
could develop

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
according to any of the above.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
An academy, a baseball team

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
or a club.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
But at one point something happened,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
or the company achieved its highest results,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
and it turns into a fortress.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Or so the situation happened

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
on the market,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
on the market

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
where one or another company played,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
according to internal and external factors,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
that this organization

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
stopped developing

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
and fell into a state of stagnation.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
A few more words

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
about corporate culture.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Actually,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
in some companies there is a culture,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
in some there is not.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
I don't even know where I work,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
is there any culture or not.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Try to think.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
If you like the company you work for,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
think about

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
why you like it.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
People. What people?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
I work because I like the people

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I work with.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Observe what people.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I like the attitude

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
of leadership to us,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
between people, between departments.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And what are the disadvantages?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
The general advantages.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
The formed corporate culture

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
supports the commitment of employees

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
to the company's values.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
In a company with a strong corporate culture

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
employees are highly valued.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And those employees who are ready

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
to contribute

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
to the efficiency

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and development of the company.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
The corporate culture defines the rules of the game

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
in any situation in business.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Rules are written in any situation.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
If this is the case,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
then you should act this way.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
If not, then like this.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
The rules.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
The rules punish the violation of the rules.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Disadvantages.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Sometimes a strong corporate culture

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
can be an obstacle

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
to a necessary change.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
We can't leave the corporate culture

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
and standards.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
They should be changed.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And this is not a quick thing.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And, of course, different corporate cultures

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
can have a negative effect

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
on the merger.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
It is very fashionable now.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
You probably hear

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
that one company merges with another,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
absorption.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
But the fact that one company

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
was, for example, a company of power

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
or a role

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
and merges with a company of a person

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
and supports them

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
as if they were together

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
is almost like getting married.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
It is very difficult.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
You must calculate everything correctly.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
What else affects

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
the corporate culture?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
The natural style of management.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
The head of any company

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
is the manager.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Managers are divided,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
like all of us, into men and women.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And there are

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
three main styles of management.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
If we break them down in more detail,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
there may be more of them,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
but the main three are

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
the direct,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
the authoritarian,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
the democratic

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
or the collegial,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
and the liberal,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
the anarchic, the nominal,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
the non-interfering,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
and the permissive.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Now let's see

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
what styles of management

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
women have.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
You may have noticed

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
that women have

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
a liberal style,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
the anarchic, the nominal, the non-interfering.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Why?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
It is probably the mother's principle

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
that prevents a mother

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
from interfering in her child's affairs.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
No normal mother

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
will allow it,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
so women do not accept this style.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Look at how many women

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
and only 25% of men

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
prefer the democratic style.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Why?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Women should consult

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
with their colleagues.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Men prefer

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
the authoritarian style.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Women only 30%.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
But I wonder

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
what women

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
are easier to work with?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
The authoritarian or the democratic?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Which is easier?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Which is more efficient?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
The question is not empty.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
It is difficult

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
to make an analysis

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
of the Russian business,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
but if we observe the market

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
and observe it

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
for another 10 years,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I think

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
we will have interesting conclusions.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
So,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
maybe we will meet

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
and share our impressions

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
on this topic.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
What styles?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Where are they effective?

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Indeed,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
there is no person

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
who is purely authoritarian

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
or fully democratic.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
There are no such people.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
We all perform roles in the theatre.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Theatre is life, life is theatre.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
We play different roles.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
If the situation changes, we have a different role.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Today someone is Cinderella, tomorrow someone is a good fairy, the day after tomorrow is Baba Yaga.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
In different ways.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Because the market is changing, because business is changing, because colleagues are changing,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
management is changing, something else is changing, and I am changing.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Directive, authoritarian,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
in extreme conditions,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
you cannot survive otherwise.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
The time limit, the management

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
should be centralized.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
I decided,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I bear responsibility.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
By the way, the question of responsibility

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
is very important.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
People like to lead,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
but it is better not to bear responsibility.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Responsibility is an important element.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Democratic, standard,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
stable conditions,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
when you can calculate,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
apply some algorithms,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
you can allow yourself

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
to fantasize about business.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And liberal.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
The liberal is ideal

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
during the merger and absorption.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
If the cultures do not coincide,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
one company

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
takes the non-interfering position.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Those who absorb them

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
most likely

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
behave authoritarily

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
and those who are calm

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
sit and wait.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
It requires a lot of

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
nervous tension

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
and the ability not to interfere

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
and not to get out.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
A certain psychotype.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
It is important to remember

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
that, as a rule,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
in a pure form,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
none of the mentioned styles

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
is found.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
The head of the organization

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
usually has several management styles.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
External factors influence the style.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
The market,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
age of the company,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
the personality of the head,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
his education,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
and the personality of the staff.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
By the way, the staff is usually selected by the head.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Therefore, look carefully

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
what your head is like,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
what styles he likes to use,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
and whether he is suitable

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
for you as a head.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Or if you are the head,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
try to assess yourself

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
and see how the organization is organized.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
You are a person,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
a leader or an employee

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
and an organization

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
with its own corporate culture

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
and different management styles.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
What else is important to remember?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
As a rule, in a pure form,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
none of the mentioned types

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
of corporate culture is found.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Not only styles, but also types.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
The organization usually has

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
not one, but several types.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Indeed, we begin to develop

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
the corporate culture as a support,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
as a task,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
and in the end we can come to the type of power.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
For example,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
the corporate culture is again

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
provided by external factors,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
such as competition or new laws,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
and internal factors,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
for example, the management's management,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
completely at the will of the company owner.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
What external factors,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
if we talk about it in more detail,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
exist?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
These are clients

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
and service providers.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Any company,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
whatever it is,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
is created for clients.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Goods, market sales,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
you need to know the needs of those people

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
for whom you create a business

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
and for whom we work.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Suppliers, of course,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
are the market resources,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
this is the price,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
the availability and use of resources.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
The competition, which does not allow us

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
to sleep, rest, relax,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
limits freedom

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
for our organization.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
The game is on the same field,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
and on the same field there are so many players

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
that it becomes tight.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Why is there a merger and absorption?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Because the larger the company,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
the easier it is to push

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
smaller ones out of the market.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Technology and technology,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
this is quite modern,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
but it creates a specific competitive struggle

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
and at the same time

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
creates even more competition.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
The company creates more and more new products.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Let's take the IT sector,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
because new technologies are introduced there

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
the fastest.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Medicine, by the way, too.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And from one introduction to another

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
time is reduced.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
That is, more and more

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
technical progress is taking place.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And, of course, the external factor

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
is the state.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Today we live by one law,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
tomorrow it was canceled,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
we live differently.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Maybe we need to re-register everything,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
license everything anew,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
certify.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
There is a lot of time,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
we are already starting to lose in business.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
These are the serious external factors.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
What else

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
affects a person

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
in an organization?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Naturally,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I was talking about resources,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
material and natural human resources.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And human resources

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
have the main distinguishing feature

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
is the presence of intelligence.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
The ability to constantly

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
improve.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And, of course,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
people come to the organization

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
consciously.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
These are very important things.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Slowly, we will touch

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
the topic of motivation.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Step by step, do not rush.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
We have considered

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
a person in an organization.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
That is,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
a person comes

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
to some organization

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
in which there is already

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
a corporate culture,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
there is already a certain

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
management style.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Under this corporate culture

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
and style, people are selected,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
a strategy is built,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
a structure,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
a certain hierarchy,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
and you get to

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
a certain hierarchy level.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
To sum up,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
we have an organization,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
we have an organizational structure and culture,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
and external factors,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
which we have already talked about.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Now, one more factor.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
The use of human labor resources.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Motivation.
