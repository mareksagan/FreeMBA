00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
When we talk about motivation of human work in an organization,

00:05.400 --> 00:10.000
a very important value, among all the above points,

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
is the problem of building leadership in a company,

00:16.000 --> 00:20.400
the problem of management functions,

00:20.400 --> 00:23.800
what kind of relationship system exists,

00:23.800 --> 00:27.200
what kind of delegated authority system exists,

00:27.200 --> 00:30.600
what kind of management style exists,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.400
is it authoritarian,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.400
you will do what you were told,

00:35.400 --> 00:40.000
and everything else is out of work,

00:40.000 --> 00:41.800
is it democratic,

00:41.800 --> 00:44.400
these are the tasks that need to be solved,

00:44.400 --> 00:47.600
these are the deadlines that need to be solved.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.800
And then there is no strict control

00:51.800 --> 00:54.200
how you will do, what you will do.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.400
Please, show initiative,

00:57.400 --> 01:01.000
use your authority, use your opportunities,

01:01.000 --> 01:02.400
make a proposal,

01:02.400 --> 01:05.600
but you must fulfill the task.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.200
How will you implement it?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.200
These are your questions.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.600
I am sure in the professionalism and competence of my employees,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.400
I am sure that they will be able to cope with their task.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.600
And in this regard, I will not waste time

01:22.800 --> 01:27.000
to control every step of theirs.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.200
There are three main approaches to management of an organization

01:35.200 --> 01:38.400
closely related to the construction of a motivation system.

01:38.400 --> 01:44.800
You have already considered different approaches to management of an organization.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.400
Let's now consider these approaches from a motivational point of view.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.200
Because as far as the management system is concerned,

01:55.200 --> 01:56.800
the management system,

01:56.800 --> 01:59.400
the system of distribution of powers,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.400
the system of delegating powers,

02:01.400 --> 02:06.800
it largely determines those motivational methods,

02:06.800 --> 02:08.600
those motivational factors,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.600
those motivational approaches that are implemented in the company.

02:11.600 --> 02:16.000
The first, the most famous type of management

02:16.200 --> 02:20.600
is the so-called direct administration.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.200
It is known in literature,

02:24.200 --> 02:27.600
it is known in business practice as the X-theory.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.600
Direct administration implies the presence of orders,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.800
orders, rules, instructions,

02:36.800 --> 02:44.400
positions that determine all methods of your behavior.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.400
This is a strict administration.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.800
There are different types of regulations.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.000
There is labor discipline.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.200
There is a reward for non-interference in compliance with the rules,

02:57.200 --> 03:00.600
and fines and sanctions for their violation.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.000
Everything is clearly written.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.400
What is allowed, what is not allowed.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.800
Where, what can be done and.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
In this case,

03:13.000 --> 03:19.200
the employee's own motivation is practically absent.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.400
The employee works only based on material stimulation.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.200
Here is your workload.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.800
Here is your positional instruction.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
Here is the department's regulations.

03:31.800 --> 03:39.200
Here is the procedure of passing the documents that are there.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.800
And here are the tasks that you have to solve.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.800
It is precisely these methods that any initiative is punishable.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
In this regard, you want to get a salary,

03:50.400 --> 03:56.800
do what is necessary and do not come up with anything new.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.600
The X-theory, which, in fact,

03:59.600 --> 04:03.400
is rooted in some kind of motivation.

04:03.600 --> 04:11.600
It seems that it is not worth saying that such an approach

04:11.600 --> 04:19.600
with strict administration often limits,

04:19.600 --> 04:24.600
not only limits, but completely deprives the employee of his own activity.

04:24.600 --> 04:31.400
Much has been said about the shortcomings that this system carries,

04:31.400 --> 04:34.400
but, nevertheless, this is the simplest system.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.200
The simplest system from the point of view of the manager's control.

04:39.200 --> 04:45.000
I can always control whether you came to work on time or late for two minutes.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.600
Whether you left work on time or left ten minutes before the end of work.

04:50.600 --> 04:57.000
It does not matter that you are sitting for two or three hours after work.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.800
It is important that you are late or that you are late for a break.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.600
I will pay attention to this,

05:06.600 --> 05:12.400
because if an organization wants to achieve certain results,

05:12.400 --> 05:14.200
it should function like a clock.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.800
If it does not suit you, look for another organization.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.000
We will all find you a replacement.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.200
Of course, there are also advantages in such a system.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.600
It clearly states what to do and how to do it.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.800
If something does not work,

05:33.800 --> 05:41.600
it indicates that you do not meet the existing norms.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.200
The management will not refuse the norms.

05:44.200 --> 05:51.200
I will refuse the employee and find someone who will meet the requirements

05:51.200 --> 05:56.200
that I consider optimal in these conditions.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.800
Theory X.

05:57.800 --> 06:05.800
Perhaps this theory is relatively successful in conditions of social instability,

06:05.800 --> 06:08.800
in conditions of radical social transformations,

06:08.800 --> 06:12.400
when it is necessary to save business,

06:12.400 --> 06:20.200
when it is necessary to limit the possibility of penetration of alien elements into it,

06:20.200 --> 06:28.000
when there is a rigid system of state regulation or other forceful influence.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
In order to avoid these or those troubles,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.400
it is necessary to meet these or those formal requirements.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.000
This is the situation that we often face in Russia

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
and the situation that we will talk about later,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.600
when we will talk about Russian specifics.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.600
As for Theory X,

06:52.600 --> 06:56.600
perhaps at the initial stage of business formation,

06:56.600 --> 07:01.600
this approach has recommended itself.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.600
Again, I draw your attention to the fact that we are now considering the management methods

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
that did not exist at all.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
We are not engaged in theory now.

07:09.600 --> 07:14.600
You can read about theory in books and the literature that is offered to you.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
It is described in detail.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
We are considering what really works.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.600
Direct administration is really necessary within reasonable limits.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.600
After all, this is not just our whim.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.600
These are the requirements that we must meet,

07:32.600 --> 07:37.600
because we must get certain results according to the concluded contracts,

07:37.600 --> 07:40.600
according to what the suppliers expect from us.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.600
Direct administration is a system that provides predictability

07:46.600 --> 07:52.600
much better than two other systems that we will discuss now.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.600
It is clear what will be done, when it will be done,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.600
and what level of quality.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.600
This is written in standards, regulations, and quality systems.

08:02.600 --> 08:08.600
The next concept of management is the management of the system.

08:08.600 --> 08:14.600
The next concept of management is either direct management or motivational management.

08:14.600 --> 08:22.600
This is the Y-theory, which is aimed at building the system of motivation in the company.

08:22.600 --> 08:30.600
According to the Y-theory, this management consists of

08:30.600 --> 08:37.600
giving the opportunity to disclose the needs of the employees

08:37.600 --> 08:41.600
and direct these needs and individual motives

08:41.600 --> 08:46.600
to the direction of the work motivation

08:46.600 --> 08:51.600
in which the company is interested as the owner of a particular business.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.600
As for this theory,

08:55.600 --> 09:04.600
in this case, it is not about direct orders and orders of influence on a person,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.600
but about indirect influence.

09:07.600 --> 09:12.600
Indirect influence, for example, is in the same system of labor payment,

09:12.600 --> 09:13.600
which we talked about.

09:13.600 --> 09:18.600
There is a fixed part that you will get, and there is a variable part.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.600
What concerns this variable part, it depends on you.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.600
Naturally, any person wants to get more money,

09:27.600 --> 09:34.600
and therefore he will be motivated to increase the volume of sales,

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
to increase the number of clients.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
I do not force you to do this according to the regulation,

09:40.600 --> 09:45.600
that every week you have to find three new clients.

09:45.600 --> 09:51.600
You found four, it's your business, but you found two, you can't cope.

09:51.600 --> 09:57.600
In this case, it is indirect influence, indirect motivation,

09:57.600 --> 10:03.600
which directs the motivation schemes of employees,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.600
which contributes to improving their motivation,

10:07.600 --> 10:12.600
which modifies their needs

10:12.600 --> 10:17.600
in the right motivational direction, which the company is interested in.

10:18.600 --> 10:26.600
The main idea, from the point of view of the management of the organization,

10:26.600 --> 10:32.600
in the Y-theory, is to use the resources and abilities of each employee.

10:32.600 --> 10:38.600
Look, in the previous X-theory, everything was very simple.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.600
I am not interested in your capabilities.

10:42.600 --> 10:50.600
I will fire you and find the person who will comply with the rules.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.600
In the Y-theory, the situation is different.

10:52.600 --> 10:58.600
Each person is individual, and each person gets something good,

10:58.600 --> 11:01.600
but somewhere he has difficulties.

11:01.600 --> 11:05.600
But you can't divide a person into parts.

11:05.600 --> 11:10.600
You can be a good seller, but a useless manager.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.600
When we use the Y-theory in management,

11:14.600 --> 11:21.600
we try to use the motivations of each employee,

11:21.600 --> 11:28.600
develop them, and then form the working groups

11:28.600 --> 11:34.600
so that the shortcomings of some employees are compensated for by others.

11:34.600 --> 11:40.600
Interdependence, interdependence, collectivism, affiliation,

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
group unity.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.600
We work together on common goals, common tasks,

11:46.600 --> 11:50.600
and achieving these goals and tasks is our common task.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.600
Everyone contributes to achieving this goal.

11:56.600 --> 12:08.600
At the same time, serious attention is paid to training and improving the qualifications of employees.

12:08.600 --> 12:14.600
In this situation, we are talking about training and development of staff,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.600
about their evaluation and motivation.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.600
This is something that is practically absent from the point of view of the X-theory.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.600
Why should I, as a manager and administrator,

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
spend money on your training and development,

12:28.600 --> 12:34.600
when I'd rather make the staff department find me such an employee,

12:34.600 --> 12:41.600
such a candidate, who will already satisfy the strict requirements that are prescribed?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.600
The situation in the Y-theory is different.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.600
Of course, I am interested in the competence of my employee

12:48.600 --> 12:52.600
and I would like to make sure that the requirements that are prescribed to him are met.

12:52.600 --> 12:57.600
But in the Y-theory, I also develop this competence,

12:57.600 --> 13:00.600
invest in the employees' resources,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.600
and this is also what motivates me to work in the company.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.600
All that we talked about earlier,

13:06.600 --> 13:09.600
when we considered material and non-material stimulation.

13:09.600 --> 13:15.600
So, we have considered two theories, the X-theory and the Y-theory.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.600
These are traditional theories of management of an organization

13:19.600 --> 13:25.600
depending on the motivation that I want to organize as a manager of my company.

13:25.600 --> 13:34.600
And these are the theories that existed in business communication for a long time.

13:34.600 --> 13:39.600
However, the end of the last century was characterized by the fact

13:39.600 --> 13:45.600
that the role and significance of the manager began to take the first place.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.600
In fact, the X-theory and Y-theory are executive theories.

13:49.600 --> 13:56.600
In them, we considered how to organize the executive functions of employees,

13:56.600 --> 14:02.600
how they would work better in terms of performing their functional duties,

14:02.600 --> 14:07.600
what competencies they need to perform the tasks that are set before them,

14:07.600 --> 14:13.600
how these tasks can be changed when given any freedom of action,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
when it is limited.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.600
But who solves these issues?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.600
Who, in the end, chooses what style of management,

14:21.600 --> 14:24.600
and, therefore, what style of motivation will be in the company?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
The manager.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.600
Moreover, not necessarily the manager of the entire company.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.600
The direct manager, the direct senior manager,

14:32.600 --> 14:35.600
the head of the department, under whose subordination the manager is,

14:35.600 --> 14:41.600
he determines the style, the degree of motivation that the manager will have.

14:41.600 --> 14:48.600
Attention to the manager gradually took the first place,

14:48.600 --> 14:56.600
and the result of the analysis of this situation was the creation of the third theory of management of the organization,

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
the so-called Z-theory.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.600
But, again, we will consider this theory from the point of view of its role, place,

15:04.600 --> 15:09.600
and structure of the motivation behavior that exists in the organization.

15:09.600 --> 15:15.600
The Z-theory is based on the fact that, indeed,

15:15.600 --> 15:22.600
in order to create in the organization the appropriate labor motivation,

15:22.600 --> 15:25.600
the appropriate goals that the organization has,

15:25.600 --> 15:28.600
the tasks that the organization solves,

15:28.600 --> 15:32.600
it is necessary to pay attention to the managerial function.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.600
Any organization has a functional executive,

15:35.600 --> 15:39.600
the staff that works to solve specific tasks,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.600
and the managerial function,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.600
the organization of the methods of performing tasks,

15:45.600 --> 15:49.600
the organization of the structure of management of the staff,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.600
the organization of the structure of interaction,

15:52.600 --> 15:59.600
the organization with various external institutions, other companies.

15:59.600 --> 16:06.600
And this managerial function really becomes the key,

16:06.600 --> 16:10.600
because it is from the manager that depends to a large extent

16:10.600 --> 16:17.600
what style of motivation, what type of motivation will be implemented,

16:17.600 --> 16:23.600
and what results we will get in the end.

16:23.600 --> 16:30.600
As for the manager, the managerial function usually includes four main components.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.600
As described in any textbook on management,

16:34.600 --> 16:39.600
the manager must plan the organization's functioning,

16:39.600 --> 16:43.600
plan business projects, business processes.

16:44.600 --> 16:49.600
The manager must organize the selection of staff,

16:49.600 --> 16:52.600
organize the compiling of the organization's staff,

16:52.600 --> 16:56.600
which must solve the planned tasks.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.600
The manager must directly carry out the management process,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
with the hired employees,

17:04.600 --> 17:12.600
organize, arrange the interaction between different departments of the company.

17:12.600 --> 17:19.600
Modern companies have long been at the level of 1, 2, 10, 15, 20 people.

17:19.600 --> 17:24.600
Modern companies are still a company of 100 people,

17:24.600 --> 17:28.600
and when there are 100 people, there is no direct target system.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.600
But the manager will not run around and tell each of the 100 people what to do,

17:32.600 --> 17:35.600
and will not even remember who said what and who did what.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.600
Naturally, it is necessary to optimize the management structure,

17:39.600 --> 17:43.600
and this optimization is up to the manager.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.600
What style of management will he choose?

17:45.600 --> 17:48.600
What subordination will he build?

17:48.600 --> 17:52.600
Direct administration, motivation, theory X, theory Y.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.600
The choice of the manager, the choice of management,

17:55.600 --> 17:59.600
is at the same time a choice of motivation, as we have just discussed.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.600
And, of course, the fourth function that is in front of the manager,

18:03.600 --> 18:09.600
and which the managers usually like to perform, forgetting the first three, is control.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.600
You have planned, you have organized, you are in charge,

18:14.600 --> 18:18.600
but you need to control how your company functions,

18:18.600 --> 18:22.600
how the tasks that are set are solved and performed.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.600
This is what is called feedback.

18:26.600 --> 18:30.600
Not only do you need to know the criteria of the work,

18:30.600 --> 18:36.600
but you also need to see how the process is implemented and be able to correct it.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.600
Not in the case when the plan is not fulfilled,

18:39.600 --> 18:43.600
the Tax Administration has started to withdraw documents,

18:43.600 --> 18:47.600
when the accounting department has not submitted the necessary reports,

18:47.600 --> 18:50.600
not when the matter is already in the process of being solved.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
But control is when we see that in this direction,

18:54.600 --> 18:58.600
sales, services, insurance, the administrative part,

18:58.600 --> 19:06.600
suddenly start to fail, which will eventually lead to a general fiasco of the organization.

19:06.600 --> 19:11.600
You need to control not the final disaster,

19:11.600 --> 19:18.600
but the degree of organization and the degree of execution of the work,

19:18.600 --> 19:23.600
the degree of execution of those plans that were planned.

19:24.600 --> 19:33.600
So, the Z-theory is oriented to build these functions of the manager

19:33.600 --> 19:37.600
from the point of view of the optimal management,

19:37.600 --> 19:43.600
but we will be interested in it from the point of view of how the labor motivation system is built.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.600
For this is the topic that interests us today, which we are dealing with today.

19:48.600 --> 19:57.600
So, the Z-theory is based on the fact that the management and execution functions are closely interconnected.

19:57.600 --> 20:02.600
And as for the management, it is the manager, the manager,

20:02.600 --> 20:11.600
who determines the place and role of each employee in the team

20:11.600 --> 20:18.600
and determines the methods and styles of solving the tasks that are put before them.

20:18.600 --> 20:24.600
It is the manager who decides what responsibility to delegate,

20:24.600 --> 20:28.600
it is the manager who decides what powers to delegate,

20:28.600 --> 20:36.600
it is the manager who decides what method of motivation should be present in the organization.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.600
What should be the material motivation with a fixed variable part,

20:40.600 --> 20:44.600
what bonuses should be, what should be the non-material motivation.

20:44.600 --> 20:50.600
Depending on the success of the implementation of the construction of the functional management function,

20:50.600 --> 20:55.600
the execution processes will be built.

20:55.600 --> 21:04.600
That is, in fact, the execution of tasks, functions that are put before the organization,

21:04.600 --> 21:15.600
the achievement of those economic indicators, profit, competitiveness, stability, and the document of turnover that exist in the organization.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.600
This is the Z-theory.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.600
And if XY is, in fact, a choice of one style of motivation,

21:21.600 --> 21:31.600
then the Z-theory is actually a theory that is a concept of switching different styles of motivation.

21:31.600 --> 21:36.600
Because it is the manager who should decide what motivation to use in solving a task.

21:36.600 --> 21:43.600
Within the framework of his company, he uses what motivation is optimal for achieving a particular result.

21:43.600 --> 21:49.600
The same result in terms of sales plan can be achieved in a year in a democratic way,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
and it can be achieved in a week in an authoritarian way.

21:51.600 --> 22:00.600
And here it is necessary to determine with analysis, to conduct an analysis of which result is more effective,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
and to determine with optimality.

22:02.600 --> 22:08.600
This, of course, no one will do except the manager, simply because this is the function of the manager.

22:08.600 --> 22:25.600
So, we have now considered the theory of organization management from the point of view of the formation of styles, methods, directions of motivation that exist for managers.

22:25.600 --> 22:33.600
It depends on the concepts of Maslow, Herzberg, McClelland, which we have considered, or those that are based on them.

22:33.600 --> 22:39.600
What we have just discussed concerns the general approaches of motivation,

22:39.600 --> 22:45.600
those models that exist in it, those successes, failures, methods, options that exist.

22:45.600 --> 22:52.600
What is the role of motivation in the organization of the company?

22:52.600 --> 23:03.600
Well, as we noted at the very beginning, one thing is different approaches that justify themselves.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.600
Everything we have discussed today, simply because we have organized the material,

23:08.600 --> 23:15.600
are undisputed concepts, and our conversation is not an academic reflection.

23:15.600 --> 23:26.600
We are looking at the results that have proved to be useful, to be competent for business.

23:26.600 --> 23:36.600
But we have said that the application of all these concepts, justified, proven, sustainable, justified,

23:36.600 --> 23:42.600
in a necessary sense, should include the specifics of the national economy.

23:42.600 --> 23:55.600
In this regard, let's turn to our domestic reality and say a few words about how the motivation system of labor in Russia is built.

23:55.600 --> 24:05.600
You are now listening to the concept of motivation that we are discussing.

24:05.600 --> 24:11.600
You have read different books in which this motivation ecosystem is used.

24:11.600 --> 24:17.600
Each of you, of course, has repeatedly tried to implement in your company

24:17.600 --> 24:22.600
the different methods, models, schemes of motivation that exist.

24:22.600 --> 24:27.600
You liked something, you didn't like something, you wanted to modify something, to change something.

24:27.600 --> 24:32.600
Each of you has experience in building a motivation system.

24:32.600 --> 24:40.600
And I would like to draw your attention to how these motivation systems are built.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.600
Of course, we didn't invent them. We read them somewhere, we took them somewhere.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.600
There is no time to conduct research in business.

24:49.600 --> 24:55.600
We take an already working model and implement it in our company, hoping that it will work.

24:55.600 --> 24:59.600
Russia is a country of specific nature.

24:59.600 --> 25:06.600
Again, considering the social transformations that are taking place,

25:06.600 --> 25:13.600
the economic radical changes that are taking place, they are no more than 15-16 years old.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.600
And this short period of time poses a great danger.

25:17.600 --> 25:25.600
First, of course, during these 15 years, a significant attempt was made to quickly,

25:25.600 --> 25:30.600
concentratedly implement the best Western achievements in Russian management.

25:31.600 --> 25:39.600
But the situation is getting more complicated because the implementation requires professional managers

25:39.600 --> 25:46.600
who can quickly react to changes in business requests, business tasks,

25:46.600 --> 25:53.600
and modify the implemented system depending on this feedback.

25:53.600 --> 26:04.600
On the other hand, the mentality of the domestic staff is quite significantly different from the mentality of the Western staff.

26:04.600 --> 26:12.600
Simply because if the Western business mentality has been around for more than 100 years,

26:12.600 --> 26:22.600
then as a result of the 80-year Soviet period, business skills were lost.

26:23.600 --> 26:27.600
The business skills were significantly lost, most of the population.

26:27.600 --> 26:38.600
And in this regard, it is necessary to take into account the difficulties that arise from motivation.

26:38.600 --> 26:51.600
It so happened that a significant part of the current active generation was brought up in the Soviet economic environment,

26:51.600 --> 26:58.600
where there was a so-called confidence in the future, in quotes,

26:58.600 --> 27:03.600
that if you are hired, you will sit until retirement, and when you retire, you will get your 120 rubles,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.600
which is enough for you.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
Now the situation is different.

27:07.600 --> 27:13.600
Now, if you are hired, it does not mean that you will work there.

27:14.600 --> 27:22.600
As for pension, we discussed it when we discussed non-material stimulation.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.600
The pension that is paid today is not what you can live on,

27:25.600 --> 27:29.600
not to mention the purchase of medicines, which in old age affect us all.

27:30.600 --> 27:38.600
What features should be taken into account in the construction of a motivation system in Russia?

27:39.600 --> 27:48.600
As for these features, statistical studies, analytical analyses were carried out,

27:48.600 --> 27:55.600
which were aimed at identifying Russian specifics from the point of view of motivation.

27:55.600 --> 28:04.600
In the end, people in Russia had the same needs, the same motives that their foreign colleagues have.

28:04.600 --> 28:11.600
But the ways of realizing these motives, the ways of formulating and presenting these needs are, of course, specific.

28:12.600 --> 28:19.600
In this regard, it should be noted that several significant points can be highlighted,

28:19.600 --> 28:24.600
which should be taken into account when we build a motivation system,

28:24.600 --> 28:31.600
either in a Russian company, or in a company where domestic staff works,

28:31.600 --> 28:35.600
where our compatriots work, where we work.

28:36.600 --> 28:41.600
The first feature that should be taken into account is,

28:41.600 --> 28:50.600
as it is not surprising, the need to recognize that every worker is valuable to the organization.

28:51.600 --> 28:55.600
The fact is that if we hire someone,

28:56.600 --> 29:02.600
we invest some money in training, in time,

29:02.600 --> 29:05.600
the employee is imbued with certain corporate ideas.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.600
The point is not that he learned something,

29:08.600 --> 29:12.600
that he can now go to a competitor and tell about our achievements.

29:12.600 --> 29:17.600
The point is that the employee is invested, the time, the money.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.600
Therefore, the employee is important and significant for the organization.

29:22.600 --> 29:31.600
In Russia, this understanding of a person as a screw in the system has been preserved to this day,

29:31.600 --> 29:35.600
which can always be painlessly replaced.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.600
It can really be replaced all the time, but painlessly.

29:40.600 --> 29:48.600
In this regard, when, for example, staff members close certain vacancies,

29:48.600 --> 29:56.600
they often have to leave not so much out of the need to close the nearest term of the vacancy

29:56.600 --> 29:59.600
on the formal grounds that a person is entitled to,

29:59.600 --> 30:05.600
education, family situation, time to get to work.

30:05.600 --> 30:10.600
The fact is that the personal qualities of a person are also necessary to take into account,

30:10.600 --> 30:13.600
and to consider it as an investment.

30:14.600 --> 30:20.600
We will now invest effort, spend our time on the development of this candidate for the vacancy.

30:20.600 --> 30:26.600
We will do our best to teach him and to fulfill those tasks that will be in front of him,

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
according to the functional capabilities.

30:28.600 --> 30:36.600
And, accordingly, it is necessary to give the opportunity to a person to show his abilities,

30:36.600 --> 30:39.600
to show his initiative.

30:39.600 --> 30:44.600
It is not worth to put a person in a very tight vice.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.600
It seems that in the context of everything we have discussed, it is obvious.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.600
But, again, it is obvious for the Western mentality.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.600
As for the Russian tradition, Russian specifics,

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
here is this obvious fact, which, again, many people know,

31:01.600 --> 31:05.600
and everyone agrees with it, but in reality this fact has to be put aside,

31:05.600 --> 31:08.600
and it is necessary to pay attention to it.

31:10.600 --> 31:16.600
The next point, which is related to the problem of motivation in Russia,

31:16.600 --> 31:25.600
is that it is worth paying attention to the process of development of the staff.

31:25.600 --> 31:32.600
Again, if we take an employee, we do not take him to close the vacancy,

31:32.600 --> 31:37.600
and report that the vacancy is closed after two weeks after the application for its closure.

31:37.600 --> 31:43.600
We take a person who is valuable to the company, as we have just said,

31:43.600 --> 31:47.600
and, accordingly, we want this person to work in the company,

31:47.600 --> 31:51.600
to develop with the company, to be present in the company.

31:51.600 --> 31:59.600
Therefore, we must implement the development program and build his prospects for the person,

31:59.600 --> 32:03.600
and implement the program of rotation of the staff.

32:03.600 --> 32:09.600
If a person comes to work and knows that he has become an accountant,

32:09.600 --> 32:13.600
and he will sit in this workplace until retirement,

32:13.600 --> 32:16.600
there is no rotation and no motivation for work.

32:16.600 --> 32:24.600
If a person comes to work and sees the prospects that he can achieve,

32:24.600 --> 32:28.600
the career growth that can be provided to him,

32:28.600 --> 32:32.600
depending on his success, on the manifestation of his initiative,

32:32.600 --> 32:39.600
on his training, on his motivation, on the assessment that will be given to him in any assessment center,

32:39.600 --> 32:47.600
then, accordingly, he will see the goal that he will strive for.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.600
This goal, if he comes to work, can be satisfied,

32:51.600 --> 32:59.600
and then he will build his professional development system in this company.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.600
In this regard, when we talk about the problem of staff rotation,

33:03.600 --> 33:05.600
there is a problem of staff assessment.

33:05.600 --> 33:10.600
This problem is actually new for Russian companies,

33:10.600 --> 33:15.600
and there are different methods of this assessment.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.600
If we talk about the assessment of staff, about assessment centers,

33:19.600 --> 33:24.600
then this is a topic of separate conversation, which, of course, will take a lot of time.

33:24.600 --> 33:29.600
But if we say it in a few words,

33:29.600 --> 33:34.600
the most popular is the system of staff assessment,

33:34.600 --> 33:39.600
as a system of 360 degrees, or a circular assessment of staff.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.600
In Russian literature, it has many names,

33:43.600 --> 33:47.600
but the essence of this assessment system is very simple.

33:48.600 --> 33:52.600
Usually, who evaluates the employee?

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
The supervisor.

33:54.600 --> 34:00.600
He decides whether his duties correspond to the person or not.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.600
Does he perform his function?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
He does not.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
What is the level of his competence?

34:06.600 --> 34:11.600
This assessment system came to us from the Soviet period,

34:11.600 --> 34:17.600
when the supervisor decided what and how he could include in the growth perspective,

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
or not include.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.600
The situation has changed,

34:21.600 --> 34:27.600
and today we assume that a person is in the organization,

34:27.600 --> 34:30.600
a person is among the people of the organization,

34:30.600 --> 34:37.600
and therefore only the supervisor is not enough to assess his competence.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.600
Any person is passionate, any person is subjective.

34:42.600 --> 34:48.600
And, accordingly, if I do not have a relationship with the supervisor,

34:48.600 --> 34:53.600
it is difficult for me to claim that he will promote me.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.600
In order to…

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
People are always subjective.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.600
The system of 360 degrees, the circular assessment,

34:59.600 --> 35:06.600
is aimed at trying to level from different points of view,

35:06.600 --> 35:08.600
this subjectivity.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.600
Here is something like an expert assessment,

35:12.600 --> 35:17.600
when a person is naturally assessed by the supervisor.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.600
That is, a person takes some position,

35:21.600 --> 35:24.600
and this person has a superior supervisor,

35:24.600 --> 35:29.600
who assesses how well this person copes with his or her duties.

35:29.600 --> 35:35.600
But, in addition, there are other aspects of the specialist assessment.

35:35.600 --> 35:41.600
First of all, this person can have his or her subordinates.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.600
For example, this is a senior manager,

35:43.600 --> 35:46.600
in whose subordinates there are two or three other managers.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
This can be a department manager,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
this can be a department manager,

35:50.600 --> 35:54.600
who has a certain number of subordinates.

35:54.600 --> 36:00.600
And when it comes to assessing this employee,

36:01.600 --> 36:06.600
there is a need to ask the opinion of these subordinates.

36:06.600 --> 36:11.600
How do they work under the supervision of this person,

36:11.600 --> 36:13.600
this professional?

36:13.600 --> 36:16.600
What system of motivation does he use?

36:16.600 --> 36:19.600
What needs does he consider?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.600
What does he focus on?

36:21.600 --> 36:26.600
What climate of relations between employees does he create?

36:27.600 --> 36:31.600
And how pleasant it is for them,

36:31.600 --> 36:37.600
what authority does this person have over his subordinates?

36:37.600 --> 36:41.600
That is, in addition to assessing the superior supervisor,

36:41.600 --> 36:45.600
the subordinates are also important.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.600
Of course, this is a tricky point,

36:47.600 --> 36:50.600
because it is difficult,

36:51.600 --> 36:54.600
but it is rare to have a situation

36:54.600 --> 36:58.600
when we are satisfied with our supervisor on all issues.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.600
And again, the supervisor always requires something.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.600
The implementation of plans, the solution of tasks.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
He imposes fines.

37:08.600 --> 37:12.600
This supervisor checks the plans as you have done.

37:12.600 --> 37:17.600
That is, there is a certain formal relationship

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
that we monitor.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.600
Do you remember the functions of the supervisor?

37:22.600 --> 37:26.600
Therefore, to assess the superior supervisor,

37:26.600 --> 37:31.600
we add the assessment of the subordinates.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.600
But here, of course, there will be subjective,

37:35.600 --> 37:39.600
because we do not like to obey.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.600
And, accordingly, we will always find the shortcomings

37:43.600 --> 37:46.600
that the supervisor has.

37:46.600 --> 37:51.600
What is fundamentally important, new and interesting

37:51.600 --> 37:54.600
in the concept of 360 degrees,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.600
is that a lot of attention is paid to the assessment

37:57.600 --> 38:00.600
of the supervisor of employees of the same level,

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
that is, of the horizontal level.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.600
We have now considered the vertical level.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.600
That is, the superior supervisor is the subordinate.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.600
But in modern organizations,

38:11.600 --> 38:15.600
there are many departments that are on the same level.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.600
You can be the head of a department.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.600
And you have several departments

38:21.600 --> 38:23.600
where there are also supervisors

38:23.600 --> 38:25.600
who do not depend on you.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.600
There is no direct direct subordination,

38:27.600 --> 38:29.600
who perform the same functions.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.600
They have their own subordinates.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.600
They obey the same boss.

38:33.600 --> 38:38.600
And they assess how convenient, functional,

38:38.600 --> 38:42.600
professional it is for them to work with you

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
in terms of solving general tasks.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
This is the horizontal assessment.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.600
Here is the circle that turns out.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.600
The supervisor is the subordinate of the employee.

38:55.600 --> 39:03.600
And the staff is of the same level.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.600
It seems that if you are on the same level,

39:09.600 --> 39:12.600
there is no direct cross-section.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.600
And, accordingly, this is another way,

39:15.600 --> 39:18.600
another opportunity to avoid subjectivity.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.600
What is the meaning of the 360-degree assessment?

39:21.600 --> 39:24.600
This is the principle that I have just described.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.600
It is the ability to limit,

39:27.600 --> 39:30.600
to remove subjective approaches,

39:30.600 --> 39:33.600
subjective assessments, subjective possibilities.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.600
This is another titanic opportunity

39:38.600 --> 39:43.600
to introduce objectivity into subjectivity.

39:43.600 --> 39:48.600
I do not want to say that this system

39:48.600 --> 39:51.600
works unambiguously.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.600
But as practice shows,

39:54.600 --> 39:58.600
with the presence of certain experience,

39:58.600 --> 40:02.600
with the presence of organization stability,

40:02.600 --> 40:07.600
with the presence of an adequate style of leadership,

40:07.600 --> 40:10.600
an internal psychological style,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
and internal comfort,

40:12.600 --> 40:15.600
this circular expert assessment

40:15.600 --> 40:18.600
is fruitful in terms of

40:18.600 --> 40:21.600
the formation of a staff reserve,

40:21.600 --> 40:24.600
in terms of building career trajectories,

40:24.600 --> 40:30.600
in terms of forming a normal working-class climate

40:31.600 --> 40:33.600
in the collective,

40:33.600 --> 40:37.600
in terms of optimal, productive,

40:37.600 --> 40:41.600
working motivation that arises.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.600
We all work in one organization,

40:44.600 --> 40:48.600
and the success of our activities depends on each of us.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.600
When such a circular assessment takes place,

40:51.600 --> 40:56.600
an attempt is made to take all possible contributions into account.

40:56.600 --> 41:01.600
In principle, of course,

41:01.600 --> 41:05.600
this is another approach to assessment.

41:05.600 --> 41:10.600
But perhaps, of all that exists today,

41:10.600 --> 41:13.600
it is the most popular.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.600
This approach is such that

41:17.600 --> 41:21.600
every person, every employee,

41:21.600 --> 41:23.600
is assessed from all sides.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.600
And it is assessed from professional and personal qualities.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.600
And, accordingly, today they assess you,

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
tomorrow you assess them.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.600
Therefore, when you know about it,

41:36.600 --> 41:40.600
it is pointless to draw conclusions here, and so on.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.600
This is the second way,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.600
the second problem

41:48.600 --> 41:53.600
that is related to the specifics of the motivation system in Russia.

41:53.600 --> 41:57.600
The next point worth discussing

41:57.600 --> 42:00.600
is the point related to the working schedule.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.600
It so happened that traditionally

42:04.600 --> 42:07.600
we have a working schedule

42:07.600 --> 42:12.600
from 8 to 8 o'clock in the morning, plus an hour for lunch.

42:12.600 --> 42:17.600
Someone from 8 to 5, someone from 9 to 6,

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
someone from 10 to 7.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.600
But still, often these working schedules

42:24.600 --> 42:28.600
do not take into account the requirements of the employee.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
If you come to the organization,

42:31.600 --> 42:33.600
you are made aware of the following.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
Here we have a performance discipline,

42:35.600 --> 42:37.600
here we have a work schedule,

42:37.600 --> 42:39.600
let it be obeyed.

42:39.600 --> 42:43.600
At the same time, let's recall the Y-theory,

42:43.600 --> 42:45.600
which we discussed together with you,

42:45.600 --> 42:46.600
the Z-theory.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.600
The employee is qualified,

42:49.600 --> 42:52.600
but he has a long way to go to work.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.600
After all, all people are different,

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
someone is a dog, someone is a toad.

42:56.600 --> 43:01.600
And, accordingly, he can come to work at 8 o'clock,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.600
but after that he will come to himself at 3 o'clock,

43:04.600 --> 43:07.600
and only from 10 to 11 he will start functioning.

43:07.600 --> 43:12.600
So why in such a situation

43:12.600 --> 43:17.600
is it so ineffective to use the employee

43:17.600 --> 43:20.600
if there is an opportunity to shift the schedule

43:20.600 --> 43:22.600
for an hour, for two,

43:22.600 --> 43:27.600
but here it turns out that the organization is located to you.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.600
Please, we are coming to meet you,

43:30.600 --> 43:33.600
but you too, please, go to meet,

43:33.600 --> 43:41.600
and perform your work activities with initiative.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.600
It seems to be an unprincipled thing,

43:44.600 --> 43:47.600
to shift the schedule for an hour or two for one person.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.600
He will work later,

43:50.600 --> 43:54.600
and usually an hour or two does not solve anything fundamentally.

43:54.600 --> 43:58.600
But the very fact that

43:59.600 --> 44:02.600
the attention is paid to the needs,

44:02.600 --> 44:06.600
to the comfortable conditions for a person

44:06.600 --> 44:09.600
is an important factor in the work of an employee.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.600
The same can be said about incomplete work week,

44:12.600 --> 44:17.600
about the ability to work either at work or at home.

44:17.600 --> 44:21.600
Now, practically, the Internet is developed everywhere,

44:21.600 --> 44:26.600
and the work of many employees

44:26.600 --> 44:29.600
is not about communicating directly,

44:29.600 --> 44:31.600
but about making reports,

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
getting data.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.600
This data can be obtained at work,

44:37.600 --> 44:40.600
but all this data can be obtained electronically.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
It is no wonder that now,

44:42.600 --> 44:45.600
in most large domestic companies,

44:45.600 --> 44:51.600
the system of electronic document circulation has long been used.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.600
Moreover,

44:52.600 --> 44:57.600
many companies today have a widespread branch network,

44:57.600 --> 45:02.600
and this branch network operates on the basis of the Internet.

45:02.600 --> 45:06.600
In order to collect the necessary data,

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
to form an analysis,

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
if this is your functional duty,

45:10.600 --> 45:12.600
it is not necessary to sit at work.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.600
If you can do it at home,

45:15.600 --> 45:19.600
or in another place where you feel comfortable,

45:19.600 --> 45:24.600
in order to present a full,

45:24.600 --> 45:25.600
competent report,

45:25.600 --> 45:26.600
a competent analysis,

45:26.600 --> 45:28.600
why is it worth prohibiting?

45:28.600 --> 45:32.600
It is done simply because people have to sit at work.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.600
In fact, in this case,

45:35.600 --> 45:37.600
we are talking about the X theory,

45:37.600 --> 45:39.600
Y theory, and Z theory.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.600
We address the abilities, competencies,

45:44.600 --> 45:46.600
professionalism of an employee,

45:46.600 --> 45:50.600
and show him that we are interested in him,

45:50.600 --> 45:55.600
and also interested in the comfort of his work and functioning.

45:55.600 --> 46:02.600
The next point of the motivation system in the Russian soil

46:02.600 --> 46:04.600
is related to the fact that

46:04.600 --> 46:08.600
to provide workers with a discount,

46:08.600 --> 46:12.600
for example, on the products produced in the companies where they work.

46:13.600 --> 46:18.600
We cannot avoid the aspiration of our Russian man to freebies.

46:18.600 --> 46:26.600
If there is an opportunity to sell products at a cost,

46:26.600 --> 46:29.600
or even lower,

46:29.600 --> 46:33.600
after all, not so many employees work in the company,

46:33.600 --> 46:39.600
and, accordingly, they do not violate the financial indicators of production,

46:39.600 --> 46:43.600
if they sell this product,

46:43.600 --> 46:47.600
the return can be much greater.

46:47.600 --> 46:50.600
Again, everything we talked about

46:50.600 --> 46:53.600
when we talked about material and non-material stimulation.

46:53.600 --> 46:59.600
The employee sees that the company

46:59.600 --> 47:01.600
not only squeezes juices out of him,

47:01.600 --> 47:05.600
but also provides something in return.

47:05.600 --> 47:12.600
We need to start from the knowledge of the mentality of our compatriot,

47:12.600 --> 47:17.600
because we are always used to get something out of something,

47:17.600 --> 47:19.600
to get some benefit.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.600
Let's satisfy this need.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.600
And this motivation scheme,

47:26.600 --> 47:29.600
this motivation line from the point of view of labor activity,

47:29.600 --> 47:32.600
it justifies itself.

47:33.600 --> 47:37.600
And, of course, gradually,

47:37.600 --> 47:40.600
large Russian companies and medium-sized ones,

47:40.600 --> 47:44.600
in recent years, as the company's economic development has grown,

47:44.600 --> 47:47.600
this has also affected medium-sized companies,

47:47.600 --> 47:51.600
began to provide various discounts,

47:51.600 --> 47:56.600
partial or full payments of labor, vacation,

47:56.600 --> 48:00.600
cultural programs, corporate events,

48:00.600 --> 48:04.600
payment of the machine's material,

48:04.600 --> 48:07.600
mobile communication,

48:07.600 --> 48:10.600
everything that is called a social package,

48:10.600 --> 48:13.600
everything we discussed.

48:13.600 --> 48:17.600
At the same time, this social package

48:17.600 --> 48:20.600
very often is a significant addition

48:20.600 --> 48:25.600
to the amount of material stimulation

48:25.600 --> 48:27.600
that the employee receives.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.600
And, of course, when a competent person,

48:32.600 --> 48:36.600
in whom the company is interested, comes to work,

48:36.600 --> 48:42.600
this social package is often the stimulus

48:42.600 --> 48:49.600
that keeps the person in the company,

48:49.600 --> 48:55.600
and, accordingly, allows him to get the satisfaction of his needs

48:55.600 --> 48:58.600
in this company, and not in the competitors'.

48:58.600 --> 49:03.600
These are the main points

49:03.600 --> 49:08.600
on the implementation of the civilized motivation system

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
of labor in Russian companies,

49:10.600 --> 49:13.600
which exist today,

49:13.600 --> 49:18.600
and which can be welcomed in one way or another.

49:18.600 --> 49:23.600
We have discussed the motivation system,

49:23.600 --> 49:27.600
we have discussed the concept of motivation.

49:27.600 --> 49:35.600
Let's now see what opinions you have,

49:35.600 --> 49:38.600
how much you think what you have heard

49:38.600 --> 49:40.600
may be useful to you.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.600
For this, you will be offered now several cases,

49:44.600 --> 49:46.600
several situations,

49:46.600 --> 49:49.600
which will present a problem.

49:49.600 --> 49:52.600
Let's discuss how you, from your point of view,

49:52.600 --> 49:55.600
based on your experience,

49:55.600 --> 49:59.600
could propose ways to solve these situations

49:59.600 --> 50:04.600
from the point of view of forming optimal motivational processes.

50:12.600 --> 50:17.600
So, we have considered and analyzed

50:17.600 --> 50:22.600
the most significant concepts of motivation

50:22.600 --> 50:24.600
that are currently used in business.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.600
We have considered them from the point of view

50:26.600 --> 50:28.600
of motivation of employees,

50:28.600 --> 50:30.600
from the point of view of motivation of the manager.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.600
But still, let's, in conclusion,

50:34.600 --> 50:39.600
return to the question of how the motivation

50:39.600 --> 50:42.600
of one person is formed.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.600
And we will consider this question not from the point of view

50:45.600 --> 50:47.600
of different theoretical approaches,

50:47.600 --> 50:49.600
but from the point of view of an experiment.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.600
The problem of formation of human motivation,

50:51.600 --> 50:54.600
the problem of formation of motivation of the staff,

50:54.600 --> 50:57.600
the problem of formation of motivation of the professional

50:57.600 --> 51:02.600
is a very important topic and has been studied by many researchers.

51:02.600 --> 51:08.600
Well, as I see it, the most significant contribution

51:08.600 --> 51:11.600
from the point of view of practical use

51:11.600 --> 51:15.600
to study the problem of professional motivation

51:15.600 --> 51:19.600
and its formation was made by Albert Bandura,

51:19.600 --> 51:22.600
a representative of the cognitive-behavioral field,

51:22.600 --> 51:27.600
who has done a lot for analysis of motivation

51:27.600 --> 51:30.600
and behavior modeling,

51:30.600 --> 51:35.600
whose activity he continues to actively work on,

51:35.600 --> 51:38.600
he is an American researcher,

51:38.600 --> 51:42.600
whose activity is trying to answer

51:42.600 --> 51:47.600
real life requests, real business requests,

51:47.600 --> 51:51.600
how to achieve the greatest efficiency from the point of view

51:51.600 --> 51:53.600
of his professionalism, including.

51:53.600 --> 51:57.600
Having conducted a large number of studies,

51:57.600 --> 52:02.600
Bandura himself, his students, his colleagues,

52:02.600 --> 52:07.600
and besides, as a result of analysis and generalization

52:07.600 --> 52:13.600
of the relevant studies conducted for a long time in the world,

52:13.600 --> 52:17.600
Bandura was able to bring together

52:17.600 --> 52:25.600
and build a principled graph of the formation of motivation of a professional,

52:25.600 --> 52:30.600
how it is carried out and how the professional growth is realized,

52:30.600 --> 52:33.600
what contributes to it, what hinders it,

52:33.600 --> 52:38.600
what dangers and obstacles exist here.

52:38.600 --> 52:41.600
This is a very important question, because we have discussed

52:41.600 --> 52:45.600
that motivation is naturally related to demotivation,

52:45.600 --> 52:48.600
some factors can motivate an employee,

52:48.600 --> 52:50.600
and the same factors for another employee

52:50.600 --> 52:52.600
can be a demotivating factor.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.600
Why is that?

52:54.600 --> 52:58.600
How to distinguish this individual suitability,

52:58.600 --> 53:02.600
individual significance of the same motivational factors

53:02.600 --> 53:05.600
for employees working in the same organization,

53:05.600 --> 53:09.600
being under the leadership of the same person.

53:09.600 --> 53:15.600
As for Bandura, he came from the fact that

53:15.600 --> 53:20.600
if a person has a clear labor motivation,

53:20.600 --> 53:26.600
and this labor motivation is aimed at achieving the goals

53:26.600 --> 53:28.600
that are ahead of him,

53:28.600 --> 53:31.600
as an employee of a particular organization,

53:31.600 --> 53:38.600
as a specialist, as a professional solving business tasks

53:38.600 --> 53:41.600
that are before the organization,

53:41.600 --> 53:47.600
then he tried to study how the level of professional competence

53:47.600 --> 53:50.600
closely related to professional motivation grows

53:50.600 --> 53:52.600
depending on the working time,

53:52.600 --> 53:54.600
depending on the time periods,

53:54.600 --> 54:00.600
depending on the fundamental events that occur at this stage.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.600
Bandura comes from the fact that,

54:04.600 --> 54:08.600
let's say, we hire a person.

54:08.600 --> 54:12.600
His experiments were put in a slightly different key,

54:12.600 --> 54:16.600
but now, since we are not analyzing Bandura's experiments,

54:16.600 --> 54:21.600
but applying his results to business communication,

54:21.600 --> 54:23.600
to business processes,

54:23.600 --> 54:26.600
we consider these experiments from this point of view.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.600
So, we hire an employee.

54:29.600 --> 54:32.600
When we hire him,

54:32.600 --> 54:39.600
it indicates that his initial level of competence,

54:39.600 --> 54:42.600
initial level of professional development

54:42.600 --> 54:46.600
meets at least the minimum requirements

54:46.600 --> 54:49.600
that are presented to this vacancy.

54:49.600 --> 54:53.600
The next stage, which, as we know,

54:53.600 --> 55:00.600
is to train and develop this employee,

55:00.600 --> 55:05.600
so that from a beginner he becomes a competent specialist

55:05.600 --> 55:10.600
who copes and solves the tasks that are presented to him.

55:10.600 --> 55:13.600
Therefore, it is necessary to train the employee.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.600
To train him with a new skill,

55:16.600 --> 55:19.600
a method of solving tasks adopted in the company,

55:19.600 --> 55:27.600
a method that comes from the tasks that need to be solved.

55:27.600 --> 55:32.600
Usually, when a person is hired,

55:32.600 --> 55:35.600
he experiences an emotional uplift and he is motivated,

55:35.600 --> 55:37.600
we talked about this,

55:37.600 --> 55:39.600
to grow and develop,

55:39.600 --> 55:44.600
because he wants to prove that the company did not hire him for nothing,

55:44.600 --> 55:47.600
he can be useful to the company,

55:47.600 --> 55:50.600
and even as a company he can be useful to the company.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.600
And in the process of this development,

55:53.600 --> 55:58.600
a person naturally forms expectations for himself,

55:58.600 --> 56:02.600
that is, the level of competence,

56:02.600 --> 56:07.600
the level of professionalism that he wants to achieve

56:07.600 --> 56:09.600
in the near future in order to,

56:09.600 --> 56:14.600
first, successfully implement the functional duties

56:14.600 --> 56:17.600
that are in front of him.

56:17.600 --> 56:22.600
Secondly, to recommend himself from the best side.

56:22.600 --> 56:26.600
Remember the need for acceptance,

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
the need for achievement,

56:28.600 --> 56:30.600
what we talked about at McLellan,

56:30.600 --> 56:32.600
but of course, there is also a need for power.

56:32.600 --> 56:34.600
Why do I achieve higher competence?

56:34.600 --> 56:36.600
I want to have control,

56:36.600 --> 56:38.600
control over my actions,

56:38.600 --> 56:40.600
control over the tasks that I am solved,

56:40.600 --> 56:45.600
and I must be able to solve the tasks that are put in front of me.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.600
The tasks should not confuse me.

56:47.600 --> 56:51.600
Therefore, I am interested in raising my competence level.

56:51.600 --> 56:56.600
In this regard, let's turn to the graph that you see on the slide.

56:56.600 --> 57:04.600
The first level that you see is the initial level of competence that the employee has.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.600
We know that once the employee is hired,

57:07.600 --> 57:13.600
this level of competence corresponds to the tasks that are in front of him.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.600
But since the employee wants to develop,

57:17.600 --> 57:21.600
since the employee is interested in professional growth,

57:21.600 --> 57:24.600
at least in order to get a higher salary,

57:24.600 --> 57:29.600
not to mention all the material motivation that we have just discussed,

57:29.600 --> 57:36.600
the employee sets himself the task of achieving a higher level of competence.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.600
The second level is the punctuation curve.

57:38.600 --> 57:44.600
Again, this graph is a clear image of the results of Bandura.

57:44.600 --> 57:49.600
In this regard, let's just assume that the first level of punctuation

57:49.600 --> 57:55.600
is the initial level of competence that the employee has.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.600
And the second level of punctuation

57:57.600 --> 58:05.600
is the level of compulsion that he has set himself,

58:05.600 --> 58:07.600
which he wants to achieve.

58:07.600 --> 58:12.600
Naturally, on this graph we can clearly see this delta.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.600
The difference between the level of competence,

58:14.600 --> 58:18.600
the lower one is what the employee already has,

58:18.600 --> 58:20.600
and the level of compulsion.

58:20.600 --> 58:25.600
If I have this delta, I want to achieve this delta.

58:25.600 --> 58:28.600
Naturally, I want to achieve it as soon as possible.

58:29.600 --> 58:32.600
Therefore, in the process of training,

58:32.600 --> 58:36.600
in the process of observing the already successful managers,

58:36.600 --> 58:43.600
Bandura built a theory of training through modeling.

58:43.600 --> 58:49.600
I choose the model, the results of the activity that I like,

58:49.600 --> 58:55.600
and I try to model, to copy its behavior,

58:55.600 --> 58:58.600
because I believe that by copying this behavior,

58:58.600 --> 59:02.600
I will be able to achieve the same results, but even more.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.600
This is the system of development of Bandura.

59:05.600 --> 59:11.600
So, a person begins to adopt successful models.

59:11.600 --> 59:15.600
This is the first section of the graph, the first sector.

59:15.600 --> 59:17.600
He begins to adopt successful models,

59:17.600 --> 59:21.600
and, naturally, he is on an emotional rise.

59:21.600 --> 59:26.600
He is motivated, very motivated to achieve the result as soon as possible.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.600
His competence begins to grow.

59:29.600 --> 59:36.600
He begins to succeed in achieving the results that are ahead of him.

59:36.600 --> 59:39.600
A person has an emotional rise.

59:39.600 --> 59:47.600
He succeeds, and he himself evaluates this as a successful result.

59:47.600 --> 59:51.600
He receives a positive feedback from the employees, from the manager,

59:51.600 --> 59:53.600
that yes, you are succeeding.

59:53.600 --> 01:00:03.600
But here comes the first critical point, or the point of the beginning of regression.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.600
Look, the situation, again, is related to any human behavior.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.600
I have a habit of behavior.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.600
I no longer think about what and how to do it, I do it.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.600
None of us thinks about how to write, we just write.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.600
However, if suddenly the task is to write beautifully,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.600
then we begin to take out letters, and, naturally, the speed of writing decreases.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.600
At first we suffer, but we take out letters,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.600
because we want our text to be written in beautiful letters,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
but then we probably get tired of it.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.600
We spend too much time writing these beautiful letters,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.600
why do I need it?

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.600
I used to be able to write, that's how I write quickly.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.600
Therefore, a person gradually asks himself questions.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600
He has expectations.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.600
I will quickly learn to write beautifully.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:12.600
I will quickly learn to get the results I need to meet the sales plan.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.600
However, the speed at which I want it does not work.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.600
My expectations of the speed of getting the result begin to differ from reality.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.600
And so I think, something is not working out.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.600
I'd better go back to my old, usual competencies,

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.600
because then I don't have to worry,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.600
I will automatically get the same results.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600
Here is the first point of regression, which you see on the graph.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:53.600
This is the first test that the employee faces

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.600
in terms of building a motivation scheme.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.600
And here his activity decreases,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.600
and the results he begins to achieve become less,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.600
lower than the level of initial competence he had.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.600
The so-called barrier to surpassation occurs.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:24.600
If a person is disappointed in the criteria of motivation,

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.600
which are presented to him, in the company,

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.600
if a person is disappointed in his own abilities and strength,

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600
what does he do?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.600
He gives up the further acquisition of a new skill

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.600
and returns to the usual behavior.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Here it is, the return to the initial competence.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.600
This barrier to surpassation is that I have accepted,

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.600
and I will not succeed,

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.600
but in the end, until the end of the trial period,

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600
usually three months in the company,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
I will reach the company,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600
I will get a salary for three months,

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600
so why should I worry,

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
I will return to what I already had

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.600
and I will safely receive this salary.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Thus, the barrier to surpassation led to a loss of self-confidence.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.600
A person refuses to acquire and build new ways of behavior,

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.600
a person refuses to achieve the desired work motivation

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.600
and returns to the initial competence.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.600
It is enough for me what I already had,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600
and in three months I will find another place to go to work.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.600
Thus, the barrier to surpassation broke a person.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Well, it broke not in the personal sense, but in the professional one.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
We are now talking about work motivation,

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
about the professional growth of a person.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600
This is a negative option, as you understand.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.600
However, if a person, an employee, meets support,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.600
meets approval, meets understanding,

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.600
if, accordingly, he understands that everything will not work out right away,

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.600
everyone went through these difficulties and everyone decided that

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.600
yes, you need to make an effort,

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.600
yes, you need to spend more time,

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.600
yes, you need to stay after work,

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.600
yes, you need to limit yourself in entertainment,

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:26.600
but if this barrier to surpassation, thanks to support, is overcome,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.600
then a person's competence gradually increases.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.600
His skills, automatic skills, begin to increase.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.600
You see, in this case, the overcoming of the barrier,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.600
in this case, the implementation of the overcoming of the barrier,

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.600
the continuous curve, it begins to rise up,

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:52.600
and a person's competence begins to grow steadily.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600
You see, it goes to the level of the boss's competence.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.600
A person, an employee, begins to be covered by his success.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.600
He succeeds, that's the most important thing,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600
I'm not worse than others, which means I can be better.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.600
And a person's growth begins, his expectations begin to be satisfied.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.600
I set myself a task and I gradually, quite quickly,

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.600
look, we are still at the first stage.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.600
This is a situation that is realized in the first week, two months,

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:33.600
in the first time when I just start acquiring new skills for my work.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.600
I am on the rise, I have received support,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.600
my competence is growing, and moreover,

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.600
it grows so fast that it exceeds even my expectations.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.600
Look, again, the same first part of the graph,

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.600
the punctuated curve is the expected competence curve.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.600
I assume that it will grow so smoothly,

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.600
and it suddenly began to grow even faster, almost exponentially.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.600
And at the point that is shown on the graph,

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.600
where it is written, knowledge transfer to the professional context,

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:14.600
I exceeded my expectations and reached the level of expected competence.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:21.600
I quickly reached the level of my expectations,

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.600
and this gives me a huge advantage.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.600
I am on the rise, I am even more motivated,

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.600
I exceeded my expectations.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.600
And here comes the second big danger.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.600
If I managed to realize my expectations so quickly and so successfully,

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.600
they begin to grow rapidly.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:53.600
Look, the third horizontal punctuated curve.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600
At first I set myself the level of expectations,

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.600
here is the second punctuated curve.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.600
Now my expectations have jumped even higher.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.600
I set myself the level of expectations,

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.600
and, of course, my delta increases even more,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.600
which I want to reach between the level of my initial achievements

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.600
and the level of the expectations that I have reached.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.600
And here comes the second danger.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.600
My expectations have increased again.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:33.600
And as for my achievements, they began to grow slower,

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.600
simply because I am mastering a new sphere of activity.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.600
And since I am mastering a new sphere of activity,

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.600
it requires more effort, more attention, more concentration.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.600
And so my competencies are higher than expected,

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.600
and I set myself an even higher goal.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Achievements of a higher goal are delayed and complicated.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.600
And here comes the second point of regression.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.600
I begin to think again,

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.600
why I am not getting what I want.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.600
Does it mean that I am worse than others?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600
Is this my ceiling?

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.600
Why can't I achieve more results?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.600
Why does everyone succeed, but I don't?

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.600
Well, yes, they work more, but so what?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.600
Every person always considers himself more capable than others.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.600
And here comes the second point of regression.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.600
I begin to think again,

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600
is this my goal?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.600
Do I need this?

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.600
Maybe, well, I have achieved a certain level of achievements,

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600
maybe I should stop at this?

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.600
Here comes the second point of regression,

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:58.600
when my expectations again diverge from my real achievements.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600
And here comes the second barrier of overcoming.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.600
My motivation is falling.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.600
I see that I am investing.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.600
But if a day, two, three weeks ago I saw a real return,

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.600
now I am putting even more effort,

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.600
and the result is the same.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.600
I am slowly starting to lower my hands again.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.600
And this is the second barrier of overcoming.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.600
Look, the second part of the graph is the part of euphoria.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.600
I exceeded my expectations and I achieved a greater result.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.600
And now comes the third part,

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.600
when my expectations are unjustified or too fast.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600
They have increased,

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:56.600
and my achievements do not meet my expectations.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.600
And then my motivation and my activity fall again.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.600
And this is the situation that occurs very often after training,

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.600
after training of the staff.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.600
It seems that people are successful,

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.600
they have completed training,

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.600
they have gained new knowledge.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.600
They would only now be able to better implement sales plans.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.600
And after a successful training,

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.600
the indicators fall.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600
And, accordingly, the question arises,

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.600
why did I spend money on training?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.600
I am a manager.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:44.600
This is the barrier that is often associated with the fact

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:50.600
that the training results that I expected do not meet.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.600
My competence falls.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.600
It naturally remains much higher than the initial level of competence.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.600
But now I am approaching the second barrier of overcoming.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.600
And now I am starting to look for new alternative options.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.600
I am starting to look for new ways

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.600
not to increase my competence,

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:18.600
but at least to keep it at the level that I have already reached.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.600
Look, because of the discrepancy in the expectation of competence,

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.600
my competence fell a little lower.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.600
The barrier of overcoming is higher than the initial level of competence,

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.600
but lower than what I had.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600
I want to cling to this level.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.600
I am starting to be afraid.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.600
What if I will fall down to my original competence?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.600
What if I am so useless and incapable?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.600
And then I have two options again.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.600
Either I put my hands down here

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.600
and try to find alternative ways of behaviour,

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.600
a new job,

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600
stop taking the initiative,

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:06.600
find new ways that will allow me to keep my competence,

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.600
even if it has fallen a little,

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.600
or I am able to overcome this barrier.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.600
Again, just to understand with the help of other people's support,

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.600
with the help of competent leadership,

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.600
that in fact it is normal.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.600
I have overestimated my expectations about my first results.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600
But it's all good.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
I will achieve what I want.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600
I will achieve my level of competence.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.600
But I just need to put more effort and spend more time.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.600
If a person understands this and receives support,

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.600
then the fourth stage is coming.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.600
I will not look for alternative ways to maintain my slippery competence.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:55.600
I will put more effort to maintain my competence

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.600
and it will reach the desired level quickly.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600
This is what the fourth stage ends with.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.600
When my level of competence is still higher than the one I had before.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
Compare these two points.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:19.600
This is the stage when I automatically use a new skill.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:26.600
When the motivation I have reaches the desired level.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.600
This is the stage when you can't stop.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.600
So, the fifth stage is coming.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.600
Here is the number 5 that you see on the graph.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:43.600
This stage is characterized by the fact that you have reached the level of expected competence.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600
And this competence has become automatic for you.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.600
As automatic as it was for you at the initial level.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.600
Only now you automatically have the skill of performing certain or other professional actions.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.600
Motivation formation is at a completely new level.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.600
You have reached your level of competence.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.600
Moreover, you have even surpassed it.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:16.600
Now, just like before, you can transfer the successful actions you have,

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.600
the skill you have acquired, to a new sphere of activity.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.600
And it often turns out that in new spheres of activity,

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.600
the skill you have developed leads to new achievements.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.600
In the sense that it turns out to be useful there as well.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.600
You have developed the skill of management so well,

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.600
that you can now manage not only two or three managers who work with you,

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.600
but you can also manage a department, your own company.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.600
You can start your own business.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.600
You have acquired the skill of time management.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.600
You have acquired the skill of management.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.600
And now you transfer this skill to a new sphere.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.600
This is where the point of leap-forward development comes in.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.600
It is called the starting point of the synergetic effect.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.600
This is where the fifth stage ends.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:18.600
When you are able to apply a successful model of activity,

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.600
a successful model of motivation, to a new sphere.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.600
You set yourself new goals.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.600
And now, without thinking about it,

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:36.600
you reach the most successful expectation

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.600
that you had at the end of the first stage.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.600
This is where the point of knowledge transfer to a professional context is.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.600
You have raised your expectations there.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.600
And here the second point of regression with the barrier of overcoming arose.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.600
Now you automatically, without your special thinking,

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.600
without your special efforts,

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.600
you have reached this level of competence.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:08.600
This is how a person's motivation is formed.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.600
But when you reach a new level of competence,

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.600
the sixth stage, which you see,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.600
everything starts from the beginning.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.600
Only now, with your initial competence,

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.600
with your initial level of development,

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.600
you will reach the expectation.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.600
But then you set yourself new goals.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.600
And so, in a circle, we set ourselves new and new goals,

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.600
new and new tasks, and we achieve them.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.600
We can stop at the level reached,

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.600
but then it will be our choice.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.600
This will mean that we are satisfied with the level of achievement we have reached.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.600
Or we are afraid to lose what has already been achieved.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.600
Therefore, it is better, as they say, not to twitch.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.600
If a person stops here,

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.600
he remains a successful leader,

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.600
who first rests on the achievements,

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.600
and then either gives way to another,

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.600
or he has to develop further.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.600
If a person does not stop at this level of motivation,

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600
he sets himself new expectations,

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.600
and again implements the same schedule,

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.600
with all the same points of regression,

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.600
with all the same barriers of overcoming once again.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.600
But now this schedule will be implemented faster and easier.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.600
Just because you already have your own experience of overcoming points of regression,

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.600
you already know the mechanism,

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.600
you already know that you are able to do it.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.600
And the schedule is compressed over time.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.600
You need less and less time to move from the first stage to the sixth,

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.600
to move from the initial level of competition to a higher one,

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.600
the one you set for yourself.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.600
This is a very important curve,

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.600
a very important result that Bandura achieved.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.600
This is the fundamental result that is required today,

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.600
based on all the concepts of motivation,

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.600
which are developed by different specialists.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.600
Based on all the concepts of building,

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.600
training and developing the staff from the point of view of its subsequent motivation.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:38.600
Because it reflects the psychological features of human professionalism,

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.600
and the features of building our individuality with subjective motivation,

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
which is present in a person.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600
This is how a person is arranged.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:56.600
Understanding, knowledge and constant vision of this schedule in your head

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.600
often allows you to avoid disappointments,

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.600
premature mistakes,

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.600
premature attempts to stop one or another activity.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.600
The individual motivation of a person

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:25.600
So, now we have seen how an individual motivation of a person develops,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.600
depending on the tasks that are in front of him.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:36.600
Let's sum up what we have discussed today.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:45.600
We have discussed the whole complex of issues related to the motivation of a person,

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.600
applicable to the management of the staff.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.600
We have discussed the fundamental theory of motivation,

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.600
the theory of Gersberg, the theory of MacLeland.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:05.600
We have analyzed the methods of material and non-material stimulation.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:11.600
We have paid attention to the specific features of motivation

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.600
that arise from the point of view of the implementation of the management system

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
that exists within the company.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:26.600
Then we have focused on the specific aspects of the implementation of professional motivation

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600
that arises in Russia.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:37.600
And in conclusion, we have analyzed the individual motivation growth curve

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.600
with all barriers, overcoming and methods of their implementation

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.600
that were discovered, justified by Bandura and his followers.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:56.600
The results that we have obtained can be considered for a visual representation

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.600
using the schemes that you see now.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.600
This is a scheme of the labor behavior model,

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:13.600
which clearly represents the structure of the information

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.600
that we have discussed when we talked about labor motivation.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.600
In this case, we see the motives, the needs, the result of labor,

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:26.600
as well as the connections that exist and arise between them,

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.600
and which should be constantly kept in mind.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:35.600
This model reflects the behavior of a living person.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.600
This model gives a way of seeing and understanding

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:46.600
at what stage of behavior and motivation a person is,

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.600
and where and what difficulties he has.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.600
The same applies to the next scheme,

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:05.600
which reflects the four stages of development and functioning of labor motivation.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:12.600
As for these stages, they all intersect, they are all interconnected,

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.600
and again, these same stages, as we have already said,

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.600
starting with the concept of oil, do not allow for jumping.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.600
We have needs that arise first.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.600
We classify these needs depending on the tasks,

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.600
on the importance that we have.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.600
Then we try to satisfy these needs,

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.600
the second stage,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:43.600
we make either successful or unsuccessful options,

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.600
and choose those options of professional behavior,

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.600
those options of motivation that meet our needs,

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.600
the satisfaction of those motives that are in front of us.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.600
As a result, we reach the fourth stage of motivation,

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.600
when we reach the level of professionalism,

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.600
the level of competence in terms of satisfying the initial needs,

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.600
and the next development begins.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.600
We have completed the scheme of labor motivation at a certain stage,

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
we need to develop further,

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.600
we need professional personnel growth.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.600
This scheme again begins to repeat itself,

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.600
only at a new level.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.600
These are the main issues concerning labor motivation,

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.600
models, schemes, difficulties, tasks,

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.600
problems that arise in it,

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.600
and the main ways that have proven their effectiveness

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.600
in terms of the possibility of solving the most complex problems

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.600
arising in such a complex sphere as labor motivation.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.600
Thank you for your attention.
