00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Good afternoon, my name is Elena Chistyakova. I am a business coach and a personal consultant.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I have more than 8 years of experience in this field.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I am a member of the International Association of Cross-Cultural Management in Vienna, Austria.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
I work with well-known training companies and educational centers.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Today you are working on your wardrobe.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
Take the course of the image of a business person and your wardrobe will start working on you.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
You will learn to make the right impression on the right people.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
You will be able to create your unique image of success.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Image. Why is it important?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Many people say that in any case they are being guided by their mind.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
But in fact they meet you by your clothes.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Anyway, the way you look matters a lot.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Because you are being chosen.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
You are one of many people.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
You should be able to attract attention and at the same time to create trust.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
Besides, a well-formed image of a business person will help you reduce time and energy for self-presentation.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Psychologists say that a person who presents himself very brightly,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
talks a lot about himself, causes irritation.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Therefore, it is very important to convey most of the information about yourself in a non-verbal way.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
And the more, the better.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
The golden rule of a make-up artist says that you need to look a little better than your target audience,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
which is your impression.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
In this case, the impression will be the most pleasant to make the right, effective impression.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
Because if you look much better, more expensive, more status, or more strict than your target audience,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
it will cause distrust.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
People will think that you are not taking your place.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
If you look much worse, cheaper, more unpretentious, more sloppy than your target audience,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
then it will cause distrust in another sense.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
What are you doing here?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Does your competence correspond to what you are doing?

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
Maybe you came and want to deceive someone with your appearance and do not correspond to your position.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Therefore, the golden rule of an image maker is to look a little better than your target audience.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
There are three main tasks in managing the impression.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
The first task is to attract the attention of the right people.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
The second task is to make yourself trustworthy.

02:49.000 --> 03:00.000
And the third important task of an image maker is to show your status, your social role, your working role, your position in the company and in society.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Psychologists say that the leader must be shown.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Remember the cap of the captain, remember the royal crown and the scepter.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
This is really important.

03:11.000 --> 03:21.000
Therefore, if you lead the team, you must show the attributes of the leader in your image, in your appearance.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And we will also talk about this in detail.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Posture is necessary in all three of these stages.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
The right and competent posture will attract your attention.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
Because a good posture is, first of all, a feeling of health and inner harmony.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And this is very important.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
In the same way, a good posture will cause trust in you.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Because you will not hide information inside yourself.

03:54.000 --> 04:11.000
And the right shoulders, a free back and a free and harmonious position in space will cause trust that no internal information is hidden inside you.

04:12.000 --> 04:24.000
It is also especially important for the leader to show a good posture in the situation and in the team.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Try to command by bending your shoulders, knees, crossing your arms and legs, bending your head.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
You will not succeed.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
On the other hand, remember how much time is spent in the army in the construction preparation.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And this is not in vain.

04:41.000 --> 04:51.000
If a person is used to holding a spread chest, straight legs, free hands, straight head, he looks like a leader.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
He feels like a leader.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And a leader in the situation, including a leader in the team.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
It is much easier for him to cope with difficult situations, crisis situations and dangerous situations.

05:04.000 --> 05:13.000
Therefore, a good posture is needed not only for an effective presentation, but for self-presentation and leadership.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
Let's see what you need to pay attention to when you build your right posture.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Knees.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Knees should be free.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Try to move them.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
They should not be very straight back.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
That is, tense straight.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And they should not be half-bent.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
They should be free.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
And every movement is free in what sense?

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
You are always ready to move, ready to start walking or jump to the side or back.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
It shows you the dynamics, the naturalness of movement and also health.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The hips should be calm.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
They should not be unbent back.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
It is very ugly.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Not pressed as if you hide your tail.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
This should not be either.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
It causes discomfort and a feeling of being subordinate.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The hips should be free.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Listen.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Listen.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Free, unbent hips, when you breathe, slightly swing back and forth.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Slightly, not much.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But it must be.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Listen to this.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Look, if you have this shell in the hip area, in what state?

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
In a state of a little back or a little forward.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Try to free it.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Be more free in the hip area.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
It says you do not restrain yourself.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
You are free in your manifestations.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
This is important for the impression trust.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Now the level of the chest.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
You should have an open chest, deployed.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
The distance between the ribs should be maximum.

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
In our workbook there are special exercises that will help you feel the openness of the chest,

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
feel the freedom of deep breathing.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
This is also the freedom of the leader in the situation.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
As they say, the naval breast.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Openness.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Free hands, not tense, lying on the sides of the body.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Not pressed by the elbows very much to the waist.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And at the same time not swinging freely.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
You completely control your gestures.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
These are the gestures that you need.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Shoulders are open and deployed back.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
It's very simple.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
You can first throw them forward, and then turn around

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
and drop on the back.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
The stomach is pulled in.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
In this case, the stomach will be pulled in.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Free and natural posture.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Head position is also very important.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
The first thing to look at, your gaze should look at the horizon.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
He should naturally look straight.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Not down, not always up.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
If you throw your head back, then the look is like a nose.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
You see a little bit of your tip of the nose.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
This is a manifestation of boredom.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Usually it annoys the audience, in front of which you speak.

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
If your head is constantly tilting forward,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
it makes the impression of a man who is hiding something.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It hurts trust.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Try to put your head symmetrically and smoothly,

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
so that your gaze naturally looked at the horizon.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
At the same time, the gaze should not pull forward and hide back.

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
This also affects trust and presentation of its best qualities.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
In order for your posture to be perfect, it is important to do it every day.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
You can do oriental practices,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
you can do western exercises.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You can do it in your notebook.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
But you need to do it consistently.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
Only in this case, your posture will help you achieve your business results.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
The first thing a person notices when you appear from afar,

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
he notices the color of your appearance, the color of your clothes.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Therefore, the first thing we will talk about is the color.

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
We will talk about what is necessary and what is the psychology of the influence of color.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
We will talk about what is bad and what should be avoided in the color scheme.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
First, we will talk about your color type.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Why is this very important for a business person?

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
You will say that if I just dress up, if I still look according to the dress code, this is enough.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
But in fact, if what you are wearing is very much conflicting with your appearance,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
it will cause distrust of you.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
This dissonance at the subconscious level will cause some irritation and some kind of rejection of your interlocutor.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
Therefore, try to follow the simplest rules even when following the business dress code.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
And now we will talk about your color type, about the need to observe harmony.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
The first color type you see on the slide is the winter type.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Why winter? It is the brightest and most piercing.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
A bright contrast between hair and skin color.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Usually it is light skin and bright dark hair.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
For women, it can be deep wine shades of hair, always cool.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Very rarely it happens bright white gray.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
But it is very rare, really.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Dark eyes or bright piercing color.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Bright blue, bright green.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Or black.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
Or purple, but it is also very rare.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Never gray, never calm.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
These shades are very piercing.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Therefore, this person needs to dress in bright contrasts.

11:59.000 --> 12:08.000
And choose accessories of piercing colors, cool shades, silver.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Accessories of silver color.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Look at the picture of this slide.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Here it is just like that.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Bright contrast, very dark black jacket, bright white shirt.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
And a bright piercing cool shade of tie.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
All right.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
What is not allowed?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Please avoid orange.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
It will kill your cool skin type.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
And please avoid obscure grayish brown shades.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
You will see how these shades distract from the color of your eyes.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
And the color becomes monotone, as if some spark, some charisma disappears.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So it really is.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
More detailed information can be found in the workbook.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Let's look at the next color type.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Very different in appearance.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Summer type from winter.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Summer type is calmer, more muted.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
This is the most aristocratic of all colors.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Calm, soft shades of hair.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Most often grayish brown shades.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
Nut, chestnut, medium brightness, medium tone.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Cool skin, can be pinkish, more often light.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Can be grayish, alabaster shades.

13:33.000 --> 13:44.000
Tint of ivory, but not completely absent yellow or red shades in hair and skin.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
Gray eyes, or having some kind of nutty or bluish color, but very not bright.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
This is the most noble gamma.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
This is the gamma of queens.

13:57.000 --> 14:08.000
Remember, Queen Elizabeth is always dressed in pearl blue, gray, calm burgundy shade.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
This is really a summer type.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
The most unpleasant thing is that for the summer type, the most negative color is black.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
Of course, I understand that in the business dress code of Business Best, it is impossible to do without black.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
However, try to wear gray shades every day and when possible.

14:31.000 --> 14:42.000
And even when you need black, choose a dark gray coal shade, but not a strikingly deep black color.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
Accessories should not be bright, should not be bright and shiny, as in winter type.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Everything should be calm and muted.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Orange color is also not suitable for summer type.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
It is cool and bright, sunny and fiery orange color kills it.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Avoid bright black and bright orange.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Look how the man is dressed on the slide.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
He has calm grayish brownish shades of a jacket.

15:15.000 --> 15:24.000
Calm tie and dark trousers are disconnected from the face with a lighter color of the shirt and jacket.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
This is very correct.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
Because even if he is dressed in a strict black color, the black color is not attached to the face.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
And thus does not have a negative effect.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
You look 10 years older and a little sick.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Autumn type.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Such people are said to be deep in the soul of the redhead.

15:47.000 --> 15:56.000
Of course, if a person has bright red hair, striking sprinkles, then it immediately indicates that he is an autumn type.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Whatever color of skin and eyes.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
But if there is a shade of red, a shade of khna, as they say bronze or copper in the hair.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
If there are sprinkles, although they can be in winter type, but then they are cool and grayish.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
And here are bright red, beautiful sprinkles.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Peach skin or very light skin.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
And bright eyes are green or brown or walnut or even blue.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Very beautiful type.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Very saturated.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Color filled with autumn colors, filled with the sun.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
This color cannot be approached.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Black color cannot be approached.

16:42.000 --> 16:58.000
All shades of the earth, all shades of autumn forest, terracotta, and just as well the shades of vegetables and fruits, which are many in autumn.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Eggplant, tomato, watermelon color.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Very good.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Colors of the deep autumn sky.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Purple-blue.

17:10.000 --> 17:20.000
In general, the colors of the autumn type are deep, bright, warm shades or contrasting them in blue-purple range.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
Very ugly for the autumn type looks black.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And this is also a problem for strict business code.

17:29.000 --> 17:38.000
Try to choose a dark shade, deep, but a little eggplant or a little brown.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Black with an eggplant shade or brown.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Or a little olive, dark, deep, green.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
This will help you to maintain harmony of appearance and color of clothing.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Beware of pink.

17:53.000 --> 18:03.000
For men it is a color of ties, for women it can be a color of lipstick or nail polish or a color of clothing.

18:03.000 --> 18:11.000
Such a sharp dissonance between orange and pink is unpleasant and does not need to be used in business clothes.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
Although, of course, modern fashion allows such color combinations.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
So, for the autumn type, all bright range is prohibited from bright black to bright white.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And pink color.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Spring type.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
In fact, such a type is rarely found, especially rarely found in Russia.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
It was difficult for me to find a picture with such a type.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Natural, such a type is almost not found now.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
Such a type is often created by women when they dye their hair.

18:51.000 --> 19:03.000
Eyes are blue, nutty, transparent and filled with color, but not deep dark.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
And this golden shade of hair is mandatory.

19:08.000 --> 19:17.000
For such a type, the colors of the spring meadow are very important.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Colors of flowers, if you can say so.

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
Poppy, green, mint, apricot.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
All colors are slightly lighter than the main tone.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
And transparent, pleasant colors on the eye.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Soft, warmer than cool.

19:38.000 --> 19:50.000
You can see a man in the picture, who is dressed in such a gentle spring shade.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
It is very dangerous for such people to wear black.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
It makes them old and makes them sick.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
Now I often see such a mistake.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
You do not need to wear anything dark, your colors are light.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
They revive and reveal your resources.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
This is very important.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Therefore, try to avoid black.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
Replace it with gray, pearl gray, blue or greenish shades.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
What do you think about the colors of your hair?

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
When I talk about colors, I am often asked.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
You said that my color is like this.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
And I like such colors.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
But what if I like other colors?

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
If my favorite color is black, and it is forbidden to me?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
In fact, there are two very important points.

20:52.000 --> 21:01.000
First, in each range of colors there are different shades of the spectrum.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
There are red, green, blue, purple, orange, black and white.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
But for each color type, the shade will be different.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
The other thing is that everyone can wear something blue, but everyone will have a different shade.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
In the workbook you will find detailed tables of your color shades.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
They also say that this color is forbidden to me, and it is my favorite.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Here we turn to the field of color psychology.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
In fact, specialists noticed the exact connection between our appearance,

21:44.000 --> 21:56.000
between the colors of our appearance, between the forms of our appearance and our inner world.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
Therefore, most likely, the shades that suit you are in harmony with your inner content,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
with your temperament and your character.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
On the other hand, if you need a color, it is especially true for black.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Our time loves black very much, people constantly dress in it.

22:17.000 --> 22:26.000
This was not the case 200 years ago, when people dressed in colorful clothes.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
But we have such a time.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
Psychologists believe that black is a color of general denial.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
The color of disbelief, of nothing in faith.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
Therefore, people who love black, usually creative people,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
this is the color of a throbbing soul.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
If you go to harmony, create this harmony inside yourself,

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
you will notice how you are more than willing to wear light shades.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
It is also very important to influence the color on others.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
If you look at our presentation, look at the different pictures of our presentation,

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
and look at the pictures in the application, you will see that if a person is dressed in beige,

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
soft, calm shades, he attracts more attention to himself,

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
he creates a calmer, more harmonious, soft, home atmosphere.

23:25.000 --> 23:34.000
If a person is dressed in cool, blue, cold, green shades, bright, screaming shades,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
then he pushes away from himself and establishes a distance.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Remember this when you formulate the goal of your communication.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
The shades of your clothes must correspond to this goal.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Distance or, on the contrary, a decrease in this distance.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
We talked about colors.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Now it is very important for us to say how to combine these colors.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
In the trainings for an open audience, I talk a lot and a variety about how to create contrasts,

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
what colors to bring closer to the face, what colors to bring further, a lot of different nuances.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
But they are interesting in the case when you dress completely freely,

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
but for business style there are narrower frames, so we will talk about them.

24:28.000 --> 24:36.000
Most often, as you can see in the picture, a man and a woman are dressed in a suit, a shirt, a man is wearing a tie,

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
a woman can wear larger accessories or a handkerchief.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
How to combine the colors of your clothes?

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Most often we wear two or three colors in business clothes.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Very correct.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Notice how many colors of your appearance are there.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Eye color, skin color and hair color.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
How do they combine?

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
If you have three colors of your appearance, for example, blue eyes, white skin and dark hair,

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
then your type is contrast and it is most effective for you to wear three colors next to the face.

25:14.000 --> 25:24.000
This is most often the color of a blouse or a shirt, the color of a jacket and the color of a tie or a handkerchief or accessories for a woman.

25:24.000 --> 25:36.000
If you have two colors, look at me, I have dark brown eyes and dark brown hair of the same color, and the skin is light.

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
My type is bright, that is, only two colors, and it is most beneficial for me to wear two colors to the face.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
This will be the most correct.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
How to distribute colors?

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
Here are the good rules of the ancient masters.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
The rules of the golden ratio.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
60% of your appearance is completely from head to toe.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
Or if you sit at the table all the time, you can count the part of your appearance that is visible to your interlocutor.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
60% is one color, the main one.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Most often it is the darkest.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
In the workbook you can see the nuances and a specific table for your color type.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
What are these colors?

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
The main color is the darkest.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
The next color is the medium color.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
It occupies about 30% of the area.

26:38.000 --> 26:46.000
In business, this is most often a light shade of a shirt, white or pastel.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
The last color is the accent color.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
This is the color of your tie for men, and for women the color of the accessories.

26:56.000 --> 27:08.000
Depending on the brightness of the accessory, you choose from 3 to 10% of the area of ​​the color spot.

27:09.000 --> 27:21.000
It is very important for the accessories that the color of the tie is not the lightest.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
The color of your tie cannot be lighter than the color of your shirt.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
This is not beautiful and does not correspond to the label.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
It should be the brightest shade or match the color of the shirt.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
In this case, the accent will be not so much the color, but the texture of the tie.

27:44.000 --> 27:54.000
I can say that according to the same rule, your clothes are distributed in your wardrobe.

27:55.000 --> 28:07.000
If your dress code is more free, then 60% of your wardrobe should be based on basic things.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Not bright, not attractive to yourself.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
They will create a background for the appearance of the following things.

28:16.000 --> 28:23.000
For example, basic things can be jeans for a free code.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
It can be calm trousers or a calm, flat skirt.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Not attractive to the eye.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
How to check whether the thing is basic.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Most often this thing can be worn for different events.

28:37.000 --> 28:45.000
You can wear it to work, you can wear it to the store, you can wear it for a picnic.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
This is what speaks about the basic nature of the thing.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
The color of the tie is calm, you will rarely see any patterns on it.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
Most often, the shades are monotonous and calm.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
The next thing that takes up the average is stylish things.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
They take up about 30% of the area.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
From 20 to 30.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
This thing shows your status, your position, your social role.

29:17.000 --> 29:25.000
Therefore, if you wear a T-shirt to the jeans, it will be a sporty style, very light and free.

29:25.000 --> 29:35.000
If you wear a more strict velvet jacket to the same jeans, it will give a different impression, more strict, corresponding to the office level.

29:35.000 --> 29:45.000
And if you wear a shiny top to the jeans, then it will be an evening option.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
Pay attention to how one thing changes depending on what stylish things we choose for it.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
30% for stylish things.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
These things must show your social status, your competence.

30:01.000 --> 30:16.000
Therefore, if you are a creative person, 20-30% of your wardrobe can lead you to the manifestation of this creativity, to an interesting design and unusual details.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
And the accent must be bright, memorable.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Thus, you attract attention.

30:25.000 --> 30:35.000
As Coco Chanel said, if you have to dress up completely and then take off some of the jewelry or put on something else,

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
then either an empty space or an extra detail will attract your attention.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Do the same in choosing accessories.

30:44.000 --> 30:54.000
You came closer from the horizon and now not only the colors of your clothes became noticeable, but the silhouette became noticeable.

30:54.000 --> 31:05.000
Those lines that your figure is outlined with in your clothes, those lines that follow the details of your clothes.

31:06.000 --> 31:13.000
There are three main types of these lines, three main figures.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Psychologists call them archetypical.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
Why? Because each of these figures carries a deep psychological meaning.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
It carries a certain social role, the role of a person in an ancient tribe.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
A triangle is a male symbol and plays a male role.

31:37.000 --> 31:47.000
It is an orientation to the result, it is a bright dominant, it is courage, power, pressure.

31:47.000 --> 31:59.000
Why? Because in the ancient tribe, the main social role of a man was to protect the tribe from enemies and mine.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Therefore, the orientation to the result is that you either protected the tribe or did not protect it.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
There are no intermediate solutions, either caught a boar or did not catch it.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Again, there are no intermediate options.

32:12.000 --> 32:23.000
And domination, strict hierarchy, these are the necessary male qualities for protection and hunting.

32:23.000 --> 32:36.000
If we look at the organization of the pack of, say, humanoid monkeys, or even a pack of wolves, or a pack of hooved, for example, wild horses,

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
you will see that a clear hierarchy among males is necessarily present.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
This is really important for the effective organization of the tribe's work.

32:47.000 --> 33:01.000
How to show yourself as a leader, how to show yourself as a male dominant, orientation to the result, to effective, bright, fast development.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Fill your image with triangles.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Look at the slide.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
This is a diagonal strip.

33:11.000 --> 33:28.000
Interestingly, in the business code of the business best, in the strictest business code, you can see it at official events, for example, at very high-level politicians.

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
When heads of states meet, their tie is necessarily diagonal.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
These are subconscious expressions of leadership qualities.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Showing yourself as a leader.

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
Diagonal strip on a jacket, sharp patches on a jacket, sharp corners of the collar of the shirt.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
The fabric itself is flat and rigid woolen fabric.

33:55.000 --> 34:05.000
It is broken, pay attention, in the corners of the jacket and in the corners of the trousers by sharp triangular folds.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
It cannot be draped softly.

34:08.000 --> 34:19.000
In the same way, the hard arrows on the trousers and the sharp corners of the boots also show you as a bright leader.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
What else can be added to this?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Slightly tiled silhouette.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
These are also triangles.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Short haircut.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It makes the head triangular.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Never a beard, only a mustache.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Remember that even in the army, beards were prohibited.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
This also subconsciously prevents the manifestation of leadership and dominance.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
I also want to talk about a tie.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
A tie is a very masculine feature of clothing.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
Pay attention, something straight, rigid, solid.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
It is not for nothing that a tie must close the buckle of the belt.

34:57.000 --> 35:07.000
In fact, a tie for today's man is like a bamboo tube in the tribe of pygmies.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
The manifestation of yourself as a man and as a strong man.

35:12.000 --> 35:19.000
Therefore, a woman, having come into the male world and having perceived all the elements of a man's suit,

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
such as trousers, smooth men's fabrics, men's dark colors, refused to wear a tie.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
Even if you follow a strict corporate dress code, a tie and a woman are very different from men.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
They are short and are most often tied in the form of a bow.

35:38.000 --> 35:48.000
Note that a modern men's suit, as it is, has been alive for more than 150 years.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
In fact, this is the only case in the history of clothing

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
that a suit has existed for so long, almost unchanged.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Why is this happening?

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
That is why, from the moment the industrial society was formed,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
and now, in the post-industrial period,

36:06.000 --> 36:15.000
the suit is the most expressive, leading, dominant, aggressive,

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
and bright in orientation to the result.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
This is the image that a modern business man needs.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
And he has been needing it for 150 years.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
However, it is interesting that very often now men try to give up the tie,

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
that is, to the manifestation of their bright male qualities.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
Men wear jeans with a jacket,

36:47.000 --> 36:53.000
try to dress in knitted clothes, in softer, calm tones and shades,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
choose light colors.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Why is this happening?

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Because our world today is returning to femininity,

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
demanding more feminine qualities than masculine.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
The circle is a symbol of femininity, a symbol of basic feminine qualities.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
The main role of a woman in an ancient tribe

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
is the birth and upbringing of children and the maintenance of the domestic chaga.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
The qualities necessary for this are not the orientation to the result,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
but the orientation, on the contrary, to the process.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
What can be the result of the upbringing of children?

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
This result is not clear and very much pushed back to the future.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
The upbringing of children is more a process, day by day,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
just like the maintenance of the household.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
There is no clear understanding of either yes or no,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
or there is a result or not.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
Agree, dinner can be prepared in many possible nuances.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
A little bit like this, a little bit like that.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
There is no such thing that either I cooked dinner or I did not cook dinner.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
There are many intermediate options.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Further.

38:07.000 --> 38:14.000
For women, the quality of creativity is very important.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
Every child is different from the other, and everyone needs a separate approach.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
The improvement of the household also requires a creative approach.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Therefore, creativity is a female quality,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
and it is manifested in the female image of the circle.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Another very important quality for the upbringing of children

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
is sensitivity, sensitivity, emotiveness, empathy, as psychologists say.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
What is it?

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
This is a quality that a woman needs to feel another person,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
to feel his child.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Because for a very long time it is impossible to talk to him,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
you can only feel and understand him.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Sensitivity, a subtle psychology in communication,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
these are exclusively female qualities.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
The circle of manifestation of the female social role,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
how it is seen in clothes.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
In the picture, it is clear that this is a very extreme,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
the most feminine image.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It is really created.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
These are transparent or stretch fabrics,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
which show the smoothness of the flow of our body.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
These are flower patterns,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
these are semicircular cutouts,

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
these are all kinds of draperies, ruches and ruffles.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
This is knitting.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
The knitting loops themselves are also semicircular.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Therefore, a man, taking off his tie,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
puts on knitted clothes,

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
softer, denim, velvet fabrics.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
It adds to its image some,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
I can not say weaknesses,

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
but some subtlety, creativity.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
And we note that really creative workers

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
do not really like strict business suits,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
they do not like to wear soft fabrics.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
And even a bohemian style in clothes,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
such a baggy,

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
not such a hiding line of the body,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
filled with draperies,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
some soft semicircular lines,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
this is just the type of circle.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Therefore, those employees of your company,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
who are engaged in creative work,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
for which creativity is necessary,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
or a subtle understanding of the psychologist,

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
like designers or psychologists,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
you can not limit such employees

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
to the choice of softer,

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
more knitted,

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
or more fitting clothes.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
This is necessary,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
because this image will help,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
will be harmonious between the inner state

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
and the strong qualities of this person

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
and his appearance.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And for such people,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
weakening of the dress code is normal and acceptable.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
They can not be driven into strict frames.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
They will not be able to stand it,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and can even leave a pleasant,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
interesting place of work for them.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Another figure is a square.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
You will say, who is a square,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
if it is neither a man nor a woman?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
This is another social role of the ancient tribe,

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
another, but this role is neither male nor female.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
This is the role of a craftsman,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
and it can be both a man and a woman.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
A square, pay attention,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
this is the most stable figure of the three.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
This is a frame.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
And a person on the inner square,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
a person who chooses and in his appearance

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
shows an abundance of squares,

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
this is a person who strives for the frame in everything.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
He can clearly set a task.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
He can track the quality of this task,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
from start to finish.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And he can successfully complete this task.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Not to stop, but to complete it

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
with the necessary level of quality.

42:34.000 --> 42:41.000
Therefore, square people are great managers of projects,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
accountants, jewelers.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
A person who does his job and does it well.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
If you need to show such qualities

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
as stability, reliability, conservatism, punctuality,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
care, commitment,

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
you can safely fill your image with squares.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
This is a cage, both large and small.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
These are also horizontal strips or vertical strips.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
These are dense woolen fabrics,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
but not smooth like a triangle,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
but rather soft, loose.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Then they are formed in the folds,

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
namely in the form of squares.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
These are square cutouts.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Here in the picture is a triangular cutout.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
Of course, it is difficult to find for a man

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
clothes with a square cutout.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
But for a man it is important that the fabric is soft.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
For a man, this is a horizontal, vertical strip and a cage.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Remember that circles are perceived as squares,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
not as images of a circle.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
Note that for a very long time

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
the men's suit remained unchanged.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
In addition to triangles, there is also a square image.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
In other words, a modern business suit

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
is a combination of a square and a triangular type of texture.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Let's summarize the conversation about silhouettes.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
You must fill your image with triangles

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
if you want to show yourself as a leader,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
as a bright leader,

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
a person who strives for an effective result,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
dynamic, active,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
strategic,

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
filled with manpower and manpower.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
You must fill your image with circles

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
if you want to show yourself as a person of a subtle psychology,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
a person who is carefully immersed in the world of another person.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
If you need to show yourself as a person of a subtle psychology,

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
a person who is carefully immersed in the world of another person,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
soft, courteous,

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
as, for example, in the case of serving very high clients.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Or a creative person,

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
who shows his side as the palace of something new.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
It can be designers, artists,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
a person who creates something new.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
Be sure to complement your image with circles,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
flower patterns,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
soft lines, drapes,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
ruffles,

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
soft, transparent or light fabrics.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
If you are a person whose profession includes

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
commitment, punctuality, strictness and conservatism,

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
this is most often the workers in the financial sphere,

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
or people who are very important for accurate, scrupulous performance and maintenance of the quality of work.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
Fill your image with squares and you will cause maximum confidence in yourself.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Other people may see you for the first time,

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
and immediately you will feel your professionalism

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
and the level of your work.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
We realized which colors we should choose in the business transcode.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
We realized which colors are suitable for us.

46:36.000 --> 46:44.000
We realized which silhouettes will help us express our self

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
and those silhouettes that will bring confidence to us.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
Now it is very important when we go to the store for shopping,

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
for those things that will help us to form the right impression,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
to buy things in size,

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
to buy things that will suit us with the features of our figure.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
In fact, it is very important what I will say now.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Most often, most of our shortcomings,

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
the shortcomings of our figure that we know, are absent.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
And they are caused only by either unknowingly sewn or unknowingly selected clothes.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
That is, if the clothes are suitable for you in size,

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
if it is well sewn and suits you in silhouette,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
then your shortcomings are absent.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
It is especially important for women.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
We will talk further about what is important for men and for women.

47:53.000 --> 47:59.000
But for women, due to their peculiarity, their subcutaneous,

47:59.000 --> 48:04.000
the structure of the skin, they have a layer of subcutaneous fat.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
So it is very important that because the skin of a woman is softer than that of a man,

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
women must pay special attention to their underwear.

48:15.000 --> 48:22.000
And the price level of your underwear should be much higher than the level of your clothes.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Why, you may ask? It is completely invisible.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
In fact, if you are a woman in the body, if you have large shapes,

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
it is especially important because it supports your shape and creates a beautiful, competent silhouette,

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
without getting deep into the skin, without creating a caterpillar effect.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
If a woman is thin, it will create the necessary shapes.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
Someone may have a bulge in the stomach, but in fact there is no bulge in the stomach,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
but the chest is simply not beautifully supported.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
That is, the chest is not supported.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Therefore, I will not talk in detail now.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
This is not a topic for discussing business clothes.

49:04.000 --> 49:13.000
Just remember that you cannot buy underwear below the cost of your top clothes.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
So, it is correct to choose clothes by size.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
The first thing you need is a fork.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
That is, you should measure not the size of the clothes you think you have,

49:28.000 --> 49:35.000
but measure one more thing the same size more and the same thing the size less.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Ideally, when in the store you measure not only your size,

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
but also the size of the clothes.

49:44.000 --> 49:54.000
In our stores, especially expensive, often there are three different suits and three different sizes.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
It is impossible to find the right size and the right shape.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
It's very sad.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
I advise you to leave such stores.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
Because many sellers sin by saying,

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
oh, you are so to the face, so to the face, and nothing does not wrinkle.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
Believe me, I go with customers on shopping sessions.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
I help customers buy clothes.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
And very often such sellers even start arguing with me.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
I say, look, the size does not fit.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Thank you very much, we leave the store.

50:29.000 --> 50:35.000
But sellers continue to insist and demand that we buy this clothes,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
which is either small or large.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.000
Why is it very important to choose clothes by size?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And try and more and less size.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
The fact is that no matter what person was in his constitution,

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
full, heavy, or, on the contrary, very thin and light,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
or some average size.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
It is important that clothes spoil him and larger in size and smaller in size.

51:07.000 --> 51:14.000
Less tightens, tightens, hangs, makes a person fat.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
Not his weight makes a person fat, but the clothes that are small for him.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
Clothes that are large make a person thin and not foldable.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
Moreover, if a person is very large,

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
then clothes that are large for him will make him even bigger.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
And clothes that are small will make him even bigger.

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
And a very thin person, large clothes will make him even thinner.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
And small clothes will also make him even thinner.

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
The most unpleasant disadvantages of your figure will be seen and even find you new.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Therefore, it is very important to look,

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
since all clothes are made according to different patterns.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Each fabric lies in its own way.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
It is important to measure and understand what the designer wanted,

52:03.000 --> 52:10.000
create what image of these trousers or this jacket or this jumper.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And what size corresponded.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
Because the size is rarely accurate.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
Exceptions are good expensive catalogs.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
If you measure your size,

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
clothes that are sold on postcards,

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
most often comes the one that fits perfectly.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
And the clothes that are sold on postcards or jackets are not complicated and simplified.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
They are needed so that the clothes that you ordered on the postcard

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
fit perfectly on any figure of the desired size.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
It is interesting that now the body composition of people has changed a lot.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
And the size and their interaction,

53:00.000 --> 53:07.000
the size of your body inside the size of the clothes remained the same.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
Therefore, very often our clothes are worse.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
Not because they are poorly sewn, but because they use our old clothes.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
And foreign clothes, which were built by designers from Italy,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
change more often and more fit us.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
And vice versa.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
It happens that for our Russian figure our clothes are good.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
It happens with shoes.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
And bad clothes of those countries,

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
in which the leg is thinner, because the Slavic leg is usually wider,

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
and smaller in size.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
Now look at the drawing on the desired slide.

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
And we will see what you need to pay attention to

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
when you buy a strict business suit.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
The fact is that a knitted sweater has fewer requirements, usually it costs less.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
The business suit should sit perfectly.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Try to buy it expensive.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
On the lining of the jacket, look at the degree of twist of the thread.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
The more twisted the woolen thread, the less your suit will be crumpled.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
It is very good when the suit is made of natural fabrics,

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
because in it you feel as comfortable as possible.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
But you spend more than half of your day in this suit.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Therefore, take care of the comfort of your body.

54:39.000 --> 54:46.000
Moreover, our offices are often filled with synthetic carpet,

54:46.000 --> 54:52.000
synthetic panels on the ceiling, on the walls, computers.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
All this electrifies the air around you.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
And it is in natural materials that you will feel most comfortable.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Therefore, when you approach the clothes,

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
the first thing you look at is the components, how many natural fibers are there.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
Choose clothes in size plus and minus.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Put on a jacket, put on trousers.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Be sure to take a shirt with you.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
Do not measure the jacket on the T-shirt.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Take the shirt that suits you well.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
And you know that it is perfect for you size.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
This is important.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
You can also measure with a tie.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Because there are interesting shades of suits,

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
in which you do not take one tie.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Therefore, it is important to take several of your favorite ties,

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
to be sure that the color of the ties fits the color of the suit.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Measure the suit.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
First, let's see, measure the jacket.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
In general, in good stores you can choose separately trousers of any size

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
and separately a jacket of any size.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Thus, they will be perfectly combined in terms of material and texture.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
And sometimes be different sizes.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
For example, if the shoulders are much wider than the hips,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
then, accordingly, the jacket is bought larger than the trousers.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
This is normal.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
What should you pay attention to?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Jacket.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
Put on a jacket, stand up straight.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
Make sure your legs are wide shoulders.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
So that you lean simultaneously on both legs

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
and feel your posture symmetrical.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
In this case, the bottom of your jacket should lie flat

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
on the horizontal line.

56:45.000 --> 56:53.000
All folds or creases or slits should lie flat,

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
as if the jacket is hanging on a hanger and not open.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Believe me, this is very important.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
If the back of the slit is open, it looks very messy.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
Pay special attention to the seams.

57:08.000 --> 57:23.000
In a jacket, the complex seam connects the sleeve and the jacket shelf.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Here.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
And in the same way, this place from the back.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Most often, if the jacket is sewn not neatly,

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
there are some ugly folds.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
If the jacket is very large,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
the shoulder that is sewn inside the jacket

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
protrudes over the shoulder.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
And the crease is formed here, on the level of the shoulder.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
Therefore, this whole department must be viewed.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
And since from the back you will see very difficult,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
you must stand straight,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
in no case can not twist,

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
otherwise creases arise on perfectly sewn jackets.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Therefore, you must ask for a second mirror.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
Or, preferably, go together,

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
so that the person who goes with you,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
told you honestly,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
unlike the seller,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
what is going on on your back.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
Is the material of the jacket flat?

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
Then you will see how the shelves lie in front.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
If the jacket is unfastened,

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
they should still lie parallel to each other,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
calmly, not very much diverge,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and not find each other.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
This just says that the jacket is selected by size.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Fasten the jacket.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Your collar should also lie neatly,

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
not to be damaged and not to be stretched.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
The collar of the jacket is located here.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Then wave your hands.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I'll show you how to do it.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
Try to bring your hands forward,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
to bring them back.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
See what happens with the jacket.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
When you raise your hands,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
he can follow you slightly rise.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
But he himself must return to the place himself.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Remember that the jacket must be measured

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
with the trousers you will wear.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Because sometimes if you measure the jacket

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
on a woman in tight jeans,

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
then the jacket walks normally.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
But as soon as she puts on a woolen skirt,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
the jacket starts to get out of place,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
rises up, creates an ugly feeling

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
small size.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Usually a slippery inner lining

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
prevents this.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
But sometimes there are unpleasant divergences.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
Therefore, it is important to measure the jacket.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
Everything you believe in, you measure with what you will wear it.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Next.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Measured the jacket.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
The jacket fit.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Great.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Thank the seller.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
We hang it on the hanger.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
We look at what happens to our trousers.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Trousers are a very important part of your wardrobe.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Especially if there is a tummy,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
some difficulty with the hips.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Maybe it's a woman, maybe a man.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
As you think, these are disadvantages.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But in fact, these are the features of your figure.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Well sewn trousers will emphasize the positive sides of the lower body.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But in no case do not bulge what is not.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Put on your trousers and look.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
They should lie on you freely.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Remember, this is a mistake of almost any man who buys trousers.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Folds at the level of the belt,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
the hip protection,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
tissue protection that departs from the belt,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
trousers are most often diverged on a man who thinks that these trousers are just for him.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
In fact, they should lie calmly.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Trousers should be more free in the belt than narrow.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Narrow trousers make a very unpleasant impression.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Why?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Because it seems that a person always corrects himself.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
He bought trousers for himself, and he corrected himself again.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And he again does not follow himself.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
In our society, which is involved in weight loss, this is not a very good impression.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
On the contrary, it makes an impression a man in which the clothes are free.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Naturally free.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And there is a small gap in the trousers, which you can easily hide with a belt.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But they will lie on you calmly and nobly.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Without this extra stretch on the buttocks and in the area of ​​the middle seam.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Next, you look how the folds are smoothed.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It is very important that on many trousers the folds are fried.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
As they say, port.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
They are smoothed so that it is impossible to redo them in the future.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Therefore, look how symmetrical, how beautiful the folds are.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Folds on the back and folds on the front trousers.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is very important that there were no creases on them.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Especially in the area of ​​the berries.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It looks very ugly.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Look, a good port can redo you trousers so that these folds are raised and there were no creases.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Most often port services are provided in stores that sell business suits.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
How to choose the length of the trousers.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
The classic length of the trousers is when you measure trousers without shoes.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You are barefoot, in one socks on the floor.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
The edge of your trousers should touch the ground.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This is the classic length of the trousers.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Just like women.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
However, now women wear high heels and wear trousers to the floor.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It is more sexual.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Trousers touch the floor.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But for men, the classic length of jeans and business suit remains the same.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
They touch the floor when we stand barefoot.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So measure please.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Our legs are very rare.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Who has the same length.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Up to 2 cm difference in length legs almost invisible.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And only noticeable if trousers are measured on one trousers, and the second is done automatically.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Please track.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:18.000
When you measure the length of your trousers, make sure that you are pierced left and right trousers separately.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Only in this case you will look symmetrical.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Your appearance will be symmetrical.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Folds that arise not only from behind, but also from the front will be the same.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
This is very important for the respectability of the impression of your suit.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Here's another thing I want to say.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
This applies to both jackets and trousers.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
About the length of the sleeves, trousers and the edge of the jacket.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It is very important that if you are tall, take yourself in your hands and do not buy suits that are not for you in height.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Find the only suit.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Maybe you will pay more for it money, but it will be to you in person and in size.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And also for a person of short height.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It looks especially unpleasant when the suit touches the knee and attracts attention as if he were from someone else's shoulder.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Attention.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Your sleeve.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
When you freely lowered your hand down, the sleeve should be below your wrist.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You must close the bone on the wrist.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Otherwise it looks like a school.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But it should not be below the second joint of the thumb.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Not below this level.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
This is important.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Your shirt should be 2 cm sticking out of under the jacket.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
This is also very important.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We will continue to talk about nuances and accessories.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The shirt should not be very short.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
When the sleeve is short, it twitches and the shirt is not visible.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
This is a bad tone.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:22.000
If the sleeve is 2 cm shorter than the jacket, it looks like school.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
If you wear a jacket, then the cuff sticks out more.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
This is normal for sleeves with a jacket.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
2 cm is the size for sleeves with buttons.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Let's move on.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Another important size is the length of your jacket.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:00.000
If you are medium height, then the length of the jacket is natural.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It corresponds to fashion trends.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It is a little shorter or longer.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It changes.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000
If you have an unusual size chest or waist,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
if you have an unusual height,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:29.000
make sure that the floors of your jacket close the middle line of the seam.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Where does your leg end?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
This place should be closed by the floor of your jacket.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Otherwise it will not look beautiful.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Now the next slide.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Shoes and accessories.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The slide is filled with details.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Now we will talk about details, accessories and shoes.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
The most important details of your business wardrobe.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
If your jackets, trousers, suits, shirts are similar to everyone else,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
they are more basic than stylish and accentuated,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
then accessories are the things that you can show yourself.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You can show your inner talent, charisma, status.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Therefore, it is especially important to pay attention to accessories.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Because they are associated with many nuances of business dress code.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Let's start with shoes.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Shoes should be in men's business code.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Shoes should be black or dark brown.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If you wear summer suits,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
these are lighter versions of the dress code,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
then the shoes can be light brown,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
but the shoes are always darker than the suit.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
If black shoes, then black socks.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It is very important that no matter how you sit,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
you leave the sports car,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.000
your leg should not be visible between the sock and the panties.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
In other words, the socks should be high, almost golf.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
The more expensive the socks, the higher they climb on your calf.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And this is correct.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Socks should not slip and fall.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Therefore, pay attention to the cost of your socks,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
to the quality of their performance.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
It is especially important that there are no mixed fibers,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
which greatly increase unpleasant smells.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.000
It is very important to treat the socks as women's underwear.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Socks with black shoes are black,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
with shoes dark brown are dark brown.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
In the label, the socks should not be darker than the shoes.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Therefore, a mistake with light beige shoes is a black socks.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And they say that this is according to the business protocol.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000
In fact, the business protocol prohibits any color of shoes except black.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Therefore, there are only black socks.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Socks should be lighter than shoes, but darker than a suit.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000
That is, the darkest shoes, then socks, and then the color of the suit.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The color of the suit is the darkest part of the suit.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
If the suit is striped or ragged.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000
What shoes can be worn in what suit?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We will talk about this in the dress code.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I will also point out women's shoes.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Women's shoes should be strict, on a low heel, a stable heel.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It is better to avoid a narrow hairpin.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
This is especially important in offices where the carpet is.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It is easy to fall and hurt yourself.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It is also very uncomfortable to sit on a chair on wheels in hairpins.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
This all interferes and distracts from the business process.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Hairpins for evening outing.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.000
All your leather accessories should match the color of your shoes.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Therefore, it is very convenient to choose one color that will be yours.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
For example, black color for men.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
In fact, this is the most standard color.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:20.000
The same color can be used for a wallet, a belt, a purse, a wallet, a leather folder for documents.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Very ugly when it differs in color.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Attracts and creates the impression of a village image.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Belt.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It is also very important.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
These are nuances, but it looks stylish and spectacular.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You make the impression of a greater status.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
All metal accessories are on you.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:55.000
For example, a watch, a belt buckle, a buckle on a shoe, details of a bag of one shade.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Silver, gold, copper.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Now there is a shade of patina.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Not beautiful when bright yellow watch, white large buckle, copper latches.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Believe me, it's really important.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
As for the business wallet, it should be extremely simple.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Most often in A4 format or in the format of your laptop.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
But it is very important, I am asked about the cost.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The cost of the shoe should be high.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Because the shoe should be comfortable.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And first of all, what you should spend on a shoe.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
This is a brand that declares the quality of this shoe.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You should be comfortable in it.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Because you spend most of your life in this shoe.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Therefore, the feeling of home slippers inside your shoes is necessary.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Also with a bag, with a business wallet.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Very ugly when it is cheap.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
When it looks cheaper than your clothes.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Your wallet should be on the level.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Even for Europeans, it is interesting observation that Europeans wear very expensive, badly ruffled wallets.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
This is not considered a decrease in business code.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
It is not necessary that it is perfect new.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But it is important that it is very expensive.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
For a woman, there is a fashion trend.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
The bag can be fundamentally different in color from all other clothes.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
This refers to a more free business code.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
In a strict version, the bag should match the color of your shoes.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Similarly, your stockings should match the color of your shoes.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
For a woman, it can match the color of the suit.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Or match the color of the stockings.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
For a woman, it is convenient to have black shoes and wear them with black stockings.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Or beige shoes and wear them with body stockings.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
This is very effective and fits to various colors of the suit.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
What can be said about the zappankah.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Very convenient accessory.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Someone is very convenient to show status.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But it still prevents work.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Someone does not like that the sleeves of the shirt come out very much.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
They really get out and get more dirty.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Especially if you spend the whole day behind the computer.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Therefore, if you wear zappankah, make sure that you can change the shirt.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Because the shirt will attract attention of the zappankah.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Remember that this is very important.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
We have a lot of vulgar in stores now.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Try to buy zappankah in expensive stores.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
This is a serious accessory.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
At the level of the watch you buy, you show your status.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
If you are not ready to buy expensive zappankah, get rid of this accessory.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Now I will tell you about ties.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
A tie is a very interesting accessory.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
It helps a man to show himself.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Everything else is too strict.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And there is no opportunity for creativity in your image.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
In a very strict business dress code, the tie should be extremely simple.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
This is just a business strip.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
A strict diagonal strip.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And more often a burgundy tie color.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You can choose any tie.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Remember that light silk ties are more suitable for summer.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
In winter they do not look very beautiful.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And in the summer they look beautiful on every day.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
A tie of a very dark, deep shade.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Or made of wool.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
How to tie a tie, you will find in the workbook.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
How to tie a tie, you will find in the workbook.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
But remember that the knot of your tie can be different due to the fabric.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
How it is cut.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
A tie is the only fashionable detail of a man's toilet.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
If you want to look modern and look status,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
then the ties of the latest models will help you.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Because the people around you will notice novelty and interest in the design of your tie.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But in a year or two, it will go away.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
There will be more such ties on the market.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
He will not attract such interest.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And will not make the right impression.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The watch is a different matter.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It was said that the watch is a serious attribute of a business man.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The price level of the watch shows the level of a business man.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Especially for the status position, for the middle level, for the owner.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Expensive watches were a necessary attribute.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
The cost of a watch is sometimes comparable to the cost of a car.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Someone has a smaller car, his subordinate.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But now the situation has changed a little.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
In the third world countries, they began to make very spectacular fake.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Fake watches are almost indistinguishable from expensive watches.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It turned out that a person who buys and wears these watches,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
on the contrary, he wants to make an impression by making a fake.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Real watches have already become a fake.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Therefore, less attention is paid to the high cost of the watch.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Of course, most managers have a good hand in Swiss quality and reliable watches.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But there is no need to overpay for their level.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Much more important, many people agree with this.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Many consultants say that it is more important to wear the latest model of the watch.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Watch factories began to pay more attention to the design of the watch.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And their difference from the next season.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
In the consumer society, even in watches,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:54.000
the inheritance of the son has become a tendency to change accessories.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And this is happening now on the mobile phone market, on the fashion gadget market.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And by the way, the most convenient way to show your status is to show the novelty of gadgets.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That is, pocket computers, mobile phones,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:26.000
some ultra-fashionable all kinds of gadgets and portable electronic devices.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:34.000
The newer and more expensive this device, the greater the status you show.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The consumer society is also a frequent change of things.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
But now in society, this is a real trend.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
If you want to pay special attention to your status,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
you should have a tie from the latest collection,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
a pocket computer from the latest collection,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
a watch from the latest collection.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I can't do anything about it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
A very interesting situation is also on the jewelry market for women.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It used to be believed that jewelry was not quite appropriate for women during the day.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And it does not quite comply with the business code.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Now jewelry companies are promoting new label rules.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:26.000
This is their marketing policy to take over the everyday jewelry market.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And a lot has begun to be released.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It is said that now the label allows small, neat jewelry, even jewelry with diamonds,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
to be worn during the day and thus also to show their status.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:53.000
But please avoid old, untrendy, tasteless jewelry, large, attracting attention.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
These should be strict business forms.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
More white gold, especially if you have a cool color type,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
than bright red-yellow gold with rubies.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000
This is what our mothers wore in the 70s and 80s.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Now two more words about the most common mistakes concerning accessories.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Men have two most unpleasant mistakes.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
The first is a bracelet.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.000
These are small bags that need to be worn in hand without a belt through the shoulder.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
This is a very bad tone.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Try to get rid of them, please.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I will not add anything to this.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The next mistake is the ring.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Sometimes at training far from Moscow, they tell me,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
how is it so?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
The ring is the opposite, a manifestation of my status.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
In these cases, I say that this is your freedom.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Freedom of choice.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
The choice to make the impression of a person of a specific place,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
a small city, or an international level.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
The level of communication at a high international level.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:36.000
In these cases, rings are good only if they reflect your affiliation to a specific social group.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Sometimes some religious or social groups,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
as a sign of emphasizing their affiliation to them,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
they really wear rings on their hands.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Another mistake is the strange color of socks.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Another mistake is to wear ties with shirts.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.000
They have a different shape of collar.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
The shape of the collar is more like a woman's blouse than a man's shirt.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
There is no necessary insert for ties.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's all.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000
For a woman, the main mistake is the abundance of cheap old-fashioned gold.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000
These are loud, filled with small details,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
cheap bags, belts, accessories.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
These are inexpensive shoes.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The same is the bad tone.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000
These are very high heels in business code.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Another very important thing is shoes.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Shoes with a heel and shoes.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Shoes with a heel.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And barefoot on barefoot.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Only with bare feet.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Never wear heels if your shoes have an open toe or open heel.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
This is a bad tone.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And vice versa.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
If everything is closed, if the shoe is completely closed,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000
it is very ugly to wear it on an open leg.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Therefore, get rid of heels, buy stockings.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
In the summer, thin stockings will save you from the heat and will not bring inconvenience.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I also want to say a little about shoes.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Especially about women's shoes.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Because men try to buy comfortable shoes.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But women often make one of two mistakes.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
The first mistake is to buy cheap shoes.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Because they are not visible under the table.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I buy what is not visible at work.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Why spend a lot of money.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
We buy shoes from artificial materials, filled with jewelry.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Which prevent you from breathing.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
With a very high uncomfortable heel.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
This is the first mistake.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
The second temptation is the opposite.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
We buy shoes that do not correspond dress code.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
These are just soft shoes.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Or saba with a huge tankette.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That is, it is not visible.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But both of these mistakes are impossible.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Even if you meet a client sitting, you still need to go out to the printer.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
It is not beautiful when the pause is tightened.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You put on uncomfortable shoes.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Which were thrown off for convenience under the table.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
You walk all day in uncomfortable shoes.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Your leg suffers.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
There are many nerve endings on the foot.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Your posture depends on your shoes.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Even if you sit at the table, if your foot feels

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
unpleasant pressure, it is expressed in your appearance.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
You lose confidence in yourself.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
You lose the image of a free, easy person.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000
This is important to make the necessary impression.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
The impression of trust to you.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
For men, I will say briefly at the beginning.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
In the business of undress code, hair should be short.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Carefully laid, neat.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Not to make an impression of excess modernity.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Some creativity in haircut.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Now it happens that men wear long hair.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Then these hair should be long enough to lay them neatly

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
in the tail.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
But remember, in any case, hair should be clean.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
They should not be greasy.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
You should wash them every day.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Regardless of the length.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Remember this.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
If you have long hair, you put them in the tail.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Sometimes it seems that the point is to wash the head, if it is still in the tail.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
But it's not so.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Beard and mustache.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Now you can wear a beard and mustache in business undress code.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And even allow yourself a little three-day non-shave.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It adds charm and charm.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
This non-shave is still a manifestation of a circle.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Remember we talked about silhouettes.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
This is a manifestation of creativity, a little bit of volumptuousness.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
If you are a serious leader and want to show your toughness,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
accuracy, punctuality, healthy aggression,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
then it is better to refrain from a beard and especially non-shave.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.000
However, if you prefer to add a creative,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
add it with a bristle.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But it should not be naturally grown hair.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
You should buy a special trimmer on the face.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Which will allow you to trim your bristle to the required length.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And make your beard neat and well-groomed.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Another special attention for men is to the hands.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I understand that the attitude to men who do manicure

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
is not always favorable.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I do not ask you to cover your nails with varnish.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But look carefully.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
If your nails are broken, bitten,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
many burrs, dry skin around the nails,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
not moved cuticle.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
All this makes the impression of negligence.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Your interlocutor will transfer this negligence to your work.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Therefore, it is very important to look very correct and neat.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
We talked about washed hair.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Now we are talking about clean, well-groomed nails.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Carefully trimmed, well-groomed.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And you can do it in any way you want.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
We are talking about clean, well-groomed nails.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Carefully trimmed nails.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
The same applies to your face.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Use cosmetics for care.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Use decent, decent creams for the face.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
After shaving, shaving foam.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
It should be all very good and correct.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Remember that if you use cosmetics at a higher level,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
the quality of the ingredients in this cosmetics is better.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Your skin reacts better to this cosmetics.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Looks better.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And the image of your respectability increases.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Therefore, do not neglect expensive cosmetics.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Even if you are a man, not a woman.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
What hairstyle?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:45.000
A woman in a business dress code can afford you medium-length hair, short, medium-length, long hair.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Very short haircuts are not welcomed by women.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:57.000
It should not be an ultra-fashionable haircut.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The length should be medium.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The hair should not get up in a short brush and the skin of the head should not be visible.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
A normal short haircut is very convenient.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
The only minus is that if the hair grows quickly, it quickly becomes careless.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Therefore, if you cut short haircuts, you need to go to the hairdresser every month.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Only in this case you will look well-groomed.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And again, you will make an impression of a person who is attentive to the little things and does his job well.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:46.000
If you have medium-length hair, you need to pay attention to the hair layout.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Of course, in good hairdressers you will be cut so that you pay minimal attention to your hair.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000
The hair is laid down after washing and left as it is.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:12.000
If the hair sticks out in different directions, if it is carelessly laid down, especially if a long time has passed after the last haircut,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
it is immediately visible and this carelessness is transferred to the products of your activities.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Now there are very good hair styling products.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
They will allow you to lay your hair very neatly.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And then fix the result of your morning work for a whole day.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
This is very convenient and does not spoil the hair.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:45.000
If you like the abundance of small curls, it is best if the curls are natural.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000
If this is your natural hair type.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But if you curl and pay great attention to the curls on the begudi and tight curls,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
most often in business style it looks superfluous.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Because it overloads your image with the silhouettes of circles.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Curls are circles.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And deprives you of the image of a serious business person.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:44.000
And you get the image of lightness, instability, less responsibility.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Most often this interferes with business communication.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Makeup.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:00.000
The best way to do makeup will be emphasizing your natural shades.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Shades of skin, shades of eyes and lips.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Let's start in order.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Shade of your skin, your tonal means and powder.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:19.000
In fact, the best thing in business makeup, and so do European women.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Unlike us, more than 60% of their money is spent on skin care cosmetics.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And not on decorative cosmetics.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Our women spend 80% of their money on cosmetics.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
What we draw on the face, and not how we take care of it.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And only 20% is really for care.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It is better to do the opposite.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
80% of your cosmetics should be care cosmetics.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You should spend money on going to the cosmetologist,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
carefully monitor the condition of your skin,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
maintain healthy and flowering appearance.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
In this case, you will make more trust.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And you will pay attention to yourself,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:20.000
not to the layer of makeup, but to the appearance of your healthy skin.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Therefore, it is better to spend money on the best cream than on tonal means.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Good expensive creams create a matte, smooth, natural surface.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And for this, a large layer of tonal cream is not required.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:47.000
If you apply a tonal cream, make sure that its surface is transparent.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
It should be invisible on the face.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Naturally, this cream will be applied with a slightly wet sponge.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:06.000
You can use powder if some parts of your skin shine too much.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Remember that powder should be good.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Then its structure is very delicate, the particles are round,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
they do not injure your skin, they are practically invisible on it.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It is very important that you apply powder with a brush movement only from top to bottom.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:32.000
In this case, small microscopic hairs on your skin will not interfere,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
and you will not have to go up and accumulate powder on yourself.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
In this case, your powder will be invisible on you.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Now the eyes.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.000
To emphasize the color of your eyes, you can choose a shade of shadows,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.000
calm, not bright, corresponding to the shade of your eyes or opposite to it.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But in business, it is preferable to have a shade of your eyes.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.000
For brown eyes, it will be soft brown shades, for gray eyes, grayish-blue,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:18.000
for green eyes, greenish-brown, for bright blue eyes, also pleasant gray-blue.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:28.000
If you like to bring your eyes closer, then the mascara should not be darker than your eyes,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
your natural tone, your eyelashes.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:38.000
It is better to use a pencil and gently blend these lines,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
so that there are no bright, annoying arrows.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
In general, dark eyeliner, dark black mascara is good only for winter type.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
All other color types are better to use soft brown or gray shades.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Be careful with blushes, it is easier to smile.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:11.000
On the cheeks, we will give a light shade of the skin.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:19.000
A pleasant pinkish-brown shade, not carrot and not pink,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
but a natural shade of your skin.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Watch out for this.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
That is, the color of your natural blush.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And just like that, apply the color of your natural lips to the lips.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You just emphasize them and give depth and a certain finish to your makeup.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Avoid very shiny, like shadows, like a tone, like blush, especially shine for the lips.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
A shiny lipstick can only be worn by a woman with very narrow lips.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Then it will look good on her, because the area is small,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:15.000
and this shine will compensate for the shortness of very narrow lips.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Next, manicure is very important for a woman.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And you can use nail polishes, you can use nail polishes,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
but it is very important to observe the desired length.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000
After all, the nails should not be longer than 5 mm,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
longer than the level of your finger.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000
That is, the nail should protrude over the finger no more than 5-7 mm.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Why does it look ugly?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
This is an evening version, and at work, especially at the computer,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
believe me, it's just a bad tone.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Even if it's a French manicure.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
After all, the length of the nails should be closer to the natural length,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
than to increase the nail twice.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000
The next very important thing for a woman is perfume.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
By the way, men also have it.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Now you can use perfume during the day.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:26.000
This is also a marketing policy of companies that sell perfumes.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But day perfumes should be simpler.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You can noticeably distinguish American perfumes.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
There is no depth of tones and fewer components.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
The smell itself is easier to perceive.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
There are no contrasting shades.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000
In French perfumes, there are usually much more components,

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
deeper smell.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
There are very deep, soft, velvet shades,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and very light, bright, first notes.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
In American perfumes, there is no such thing.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
After all, business perfumes should not be heavy.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.000
There should not be heavy musk or white-colored scents.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
There should be a sense of freshness,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
a sense of lightness, tones, some sea citrus aromas.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000
For men, the smells of forest, the smells of poplar,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
the smells of wood, the smells of leather are good.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
In any case, this smell should not be obsessive.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000
You should not leave a trail, like evening, noisy scents.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Everything should be easy and unobtrusive.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.000
A person should feel the smell only if it comes close to you,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
when you shake hands, if it tilts to you,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
look at the paper, or similar things.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Watch this carefully, please.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
We talked about details.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
We talked about how to buy and choose a business suit.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000
We talked about how to choose accessories correctly.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.000
We talked about what attention should be paid to your hairstyle and perfume.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
We talked about shoes.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But it is important to understand that in business and business etiquette

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
there are different levels of business code.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
In other words, there are certain events

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:39.000
where you should come and dress with maximum severity and endurance.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And on the contrary, there are some events,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
or there is such a level of company with a certain dress code,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
or, for example, there are so-called free Fridays,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
where you can make a weakening, you can dress more simply,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
naturally, unobtrusively, more personally than corporately.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Therefore, we will definitely consider all business codes

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
from the most strict, which is called in English business best,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
that is, the best business style.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And in the Russian tradition, it is more often called the strict business style.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And we will go down to the most free business style,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000
to the style of free Fridays or back offices,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
that is, employees of offices who never meet, never intersect with clients.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
So, strict business style.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
For a man, it is always a white shirt and always a tie.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000
A tie of calm, muted tones.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Most often a diagonal strip.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Much less often a monotonous or geometrically located crop.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
But still, a diagonal strip is better.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
The suit is very dark, dark shades.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Only in the summer heat, light gray-pearl shades are possible.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
There is also a rule that after 6 there is no brown color.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Here everything is the same.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
If this is a solemn occasion, a solemn dinner, a festive event,

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
you should not have a brown shade.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I already said the white shirt.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Here are good zappanki, but you can leave buttons on the shirt.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Usually two buttons on such a parade shirt.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Pants with arrows.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
In most cases, in the color of the jacket.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
That is, they are a separate jacket and pants for you in a suit.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Shoes are only black.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And socks, respectively, only black.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And shoes for men, they are shoes, not shoes.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
This is a flat, thin leather sole.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.000
This is a smooth leather chevron.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Chevron is a smooth leather.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
These are the shoes that you see on the slide.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Of course, we said that no borscht.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
You can have a leather folder, you can have a leather portfolio.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
But no canvas portfolios.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
It is better to exclude canvas portfolios,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
only if it is an accessory of your company, a corporate company.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
This portfolio is just the material of the company.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
This is not your personal thing.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Very strict accessories.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
They are minimal.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
There are practically no accents on them, for example, on the belt buckle.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Everything is very strict.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Everything is aimed at creating a strict business image without unnecessary details.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Yes, here's another very important thing.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
A bad tone is a clip on a tie.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Please get rid of it.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Now the following.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000
A woman in a business best code.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000
In fact, you see on the slide a woman in trousers.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
But in the most strict version, a woman should be in a skirt.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Straight, in a strict skirt, on the knee.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
A stocking is only body color.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Shoes are also only black.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
The shirt is only white, but without a tie.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000
In some cases, it is possible to use a scarf,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000
strict patterns of a classic silk scarf.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
The jewelry is minimal.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Neat, calm, in no case cheap.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
On the other hand, it is better to have them all.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Shoes in a stable, low heel.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Depending on the size of the foot, from 3 to 6 cm.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
6-7 cm.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000
The bag is strict, more like a man's wallet or a man's folder,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
than a cute woman's bag with ruffles, bows,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000
with some yarns, pockets and small details.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
No, a very strict, calm bag.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Strict hair, long hair,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
must be tightened to the tail or to the bun.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
They are laid and covered with varnish,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
so that the hair does not break out of the hairstyle.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
This is really important.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Medium hair is straight and lies hair to hair.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Business style.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Men allow more.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Notice more colors of the suit.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
You can afford light suits,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
you can afford linen suits in the summer.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Suits with a jacket, jacket without lining,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
or lining only half, only on the floors.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You can afford to walk without a jacket.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You can afford a variety of colors,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000
creative patterns, hooliganism on your tie.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
The shirt can have all kinds of shades.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
On the shirt may appear stripes or a cell.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
But a man's flower pattern does not belong to the usual business style.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Your suit should not necessarily be smooth,

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
with smooth wool, as in a very strict business style.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
In a simple business style,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
you can afford softer fabrics,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
buclet, loose, tweed.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
You can afford shoes on a thicker sole.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000
The sole can be synthetic or rubber.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
You can wear winter shoes in winter.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
In a business style, even in winter,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
you should wear shoes on a thin sole.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
In a business style, this is not necessary.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
You can wear shoes that look strict,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.000
but it does not have to be shoes on a thin sole and thin leather.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
You can choose.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Women can afford even married shoes.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Although this is not very recommended.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
You can afford in a business style

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
different colors of trousers and jacket.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You can afford to take off the jacket,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
you can afford a knitted vest if it's cold.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000
If it's very hot, you can wear a shirt with a short sleeve.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Now they say that if I wear a tie and a shirt with a short sleeve,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I make the impression of a consultant seller.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I do not know why this happens.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
The most important thing is not to wear a shirt with a short sleeve under a jacket.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
If in summer you go without a jacket,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
you can wear a shirt with a tie and a short sleeve.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
It will be fine.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
There is more variety.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I specially selected those pictures that allow

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
to express more creative possibilities in a business style.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
There are decorations that can attract attention.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
You can wear loose hair.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Medium hair length can be laid in soft curls.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Long hair should be laid in a ponytail.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000
But in a more free form not necessarily smooth hair.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Women can afford in a business style

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
strict knitted, thin knitted,

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
very thin, very thin loops,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
strict, even type.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Bright patterns, light shades,

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
pastel shades also appear in business style.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
For women, these can be bright colored suits.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Creative elements.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
In summer, in our country, the summer is not long,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
so the business code is reduced.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
In summer, you can wear linen trousers with a more free cut.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:14.000
In hot days, you can wear open shoes.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And do not wear stockings.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Although in fact, for business style, for women, stockings are necessary.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Free business style is a style for free Fridays,

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
for back office.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.000
If business is necessary for some very important business events,

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
for important negotiations, for presentations,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
for meetings at exhibitions, for meetings at a high level,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
then business style is a common everyday style of the office

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and people who meet with their clients.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Free business style is a style of Fridays,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000
a style of a person who always works and never meets with clients.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Or this is a style in a company that declares its democracy,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
or which simply does not pay any attention to the dress code of employees,

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and everyone can go where they want,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
but still observing a certain level of decency.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Men can wear jumpers, but most often jumpers with shirts.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Jumper without shirts or even without a T-shirt under it on a naked body,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:35.000
it is very stylish, but in any case, in free business style is not accepted.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Women can wear knitted clothes,

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
can use a large knitted,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:48.000
can use a deeper neckline,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
open up your body more than in business style,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
can use stretch fabrics,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
that is, a little more fitting your body,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
can use a vest, walk without a stocking,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000
or wear a pair of sandals, very cool.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Men can wear soft tweed jackets,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
and women and men can wear strict jeans.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
That is, jeans without any very bright elements, bright details,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
some extra ruffles,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:29.000
or interesting colors,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
that is, for example, scuffs,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
or some strange decals,

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
all this can be worn in free business style.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Usually for men it is a strict jumper with a shirt and jeans,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
or with a light jacket,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
and for women it is also a knitted blouse,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
knitted T-shirt and jeans.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Nevertheless, in any case, for business style is unacceptable,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000
when a woman opens a neckline,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
that is, fully open shoulders and chest,

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
and a man can not wear T-shirts,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
and most often T-shirts are not accepted, even on the hottest days.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
It is also not very good for a woman if she wears very short skirts,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
in any case, this is not beautiful for business style,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:20.000
and very large, eye-catching and contrasting to clothes accessories.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
What to do if strict clothing does not meet the internal needs?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Indeed, what to do?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And very often at training I am asked this question.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.000
What to do if I, according to the business code of my company,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
need to wear only a black jacket and a black skirt,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and a white blouse and nothing else,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
and I am strangled by this combination of colors,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I am strangled by this strictness,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I want to wear lighter, more free and often more comfortable things.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Because, of course, if it is a strict business skirt,

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.000
it is not as comfortable as soft cotton paper jeans, let's say.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I advise to do the following.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.000
For women, a way of effective underwear is very suitable.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
If it is very difficult for you in a strict,

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
masculine, laconic, conservative clothes,

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000
put on very feminine,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000
filled with all kinds of feminine images,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
floral patterns, hip-pure inserts,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.000
some very interesting color or texture of underwear,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
it will not be visible.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Of course, this will slightly break the general style of your clothes.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But if your underwear is not visible,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
it will give you the feeling of femininity,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
which you lack in appearance.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
You will feel confident and calm,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
and at the same time fully correspond to the business dress code.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:08.000
If you are a man and you need to wear a very strict business suit,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.000
and you want to give the impression of brightness and be different from others,

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:19.000
you can express yourself in your watch, let's say, and in your tie.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:28.000
There is no etiquette rule to not wear large or electronic watches with a business suit.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Yes, in fact, these rules are just made up.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I was in Japan, and almost all Japanese wear huge, large,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
even weather stations on their hands.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
They consider it fashionable and effective, and wear it to the business suit.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
They all go to work in strict black suits and white shirts,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
and with such huge, interesting watches.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Thus, the Japanese get rid of the need to be very similar to each other.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
And in the same way you can express yourself in ties.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Today's companies offer you a huge range of ties,

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
none of them are like the other.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
There are ties with some gambling, even hooligan patterns.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And in fact, for business code it is normal.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.000
You can also have some interesting shirts.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I saw a man's strict white shirt with a hooligan inscription on the back.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
If you do not shoot a presentation, let's say, or a conversation in a jacket,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
then on the one hand you look very strict,

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.000
but on the other hand, this note of such a hooliganism gives you confidence in yourself.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.000
What is the importance of attention to details?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:58.000
And once again, in conclusion, I remind you that attention to details will bring you success.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Depending on your own type of character, your own temperament,

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000
depending on the goals that your communication,

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
presentation, negotiations, business conversation,

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:23.000
and communication with colleagues, with your team at work,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000
depending on the goal, depending on your inner world,

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000
you must build your image, the image of success.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Remember that harmony attracts.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
You need to manage your impressions.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Then you will attract attention to yourself, the attention, the necessary attention of the right people.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
You will cause the necessary trust, especially this is important,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:58.000
at your first meeting with a new client, with a new employer, with new team members.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And finally, you will show your social or corporate role.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Then you will not need to present yourself for a long time,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:16.000
and this will reduce the possibility of distrust or irritation,

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000
that is, negative emotions in your interlocutors, in your audience.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Remember harmony, remember attention to details,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
remember that the business code must be,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000
that your business look must be well-groomed and neat.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Remember the time and place,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.000
the influence of color and the influence of textures, the influence of silhouettes.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.000
And finally, the golden ratio is very important,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
this is the main sign and symbol of harmony.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Thank you very much.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Create your unique image.
