WEBVTT

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.540
Good day.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.260
My name is Natalya Ivanovna Dmitrieva.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.400
The World Trade Organization

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.500
changes the Russian

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.320
economy.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.360
In the course of international

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.720
economic relations we considered

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.340
with you that one of the forms

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.960
of international economic relations

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.340
is interstate

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.080
regulation of foreign

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.740
trade relations.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.140
The organizations involved in this process

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.720
are, first of all, the International

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.060
Monetary Fund, the World Bank,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.060
the Bank for International Settlements.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.520
The World Trade Organization is one

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.100
of the international organizations

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.060
that regulates foreign economic

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.500
relations within the framework

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520
of the activities of about 150 countries.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.000
The World Trade Organization

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.740
(WTO) is the first organization

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.520
that regulates trade relations.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000
The history of the establishment

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.960
of the World Trade Organization.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.240
In 1947, in the postwar period, as we

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.220
already know, the countries of Europe

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.140
were moving to remove barriers.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.980
Since the barrier was so high

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.760
in the postwar period, it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.540
was prohibitive.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.240
The US assistance under the Marshal

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.140
Plan envisaged the fulfillment by all

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.160
countries of the future European Union

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.300
of the conditions of liberalization

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.060
of foreign trade relations.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.520
Therefore, negotiations within

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.260
the ministries of countries that would

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.680
like to liberalize their

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.600
international relations began almost

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.120
immediately in the post-war period.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.760
The negotiations were long enough.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.240
As you can see, there were

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920
a lot of rounds.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.900
Each round lasted for more

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.720
than a year, but a general

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540
trade tariff agreement

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.840
was eventually signed.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.980
The agreements that were reached

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.220
and signed within the framework of the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.180
GATT then formed the basis for

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.620
the next stage of development

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.880
of international regulation of

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.680
foreign trade, namely the creation

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.680
of the World Trade Organization.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.680
On January 1, 1995, the GATT

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.620
was transformed into the World

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.920
Trade Organization.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.000
In this case, as far as the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.600
Uruguayan documents signed in

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.520
the Uruguayan Round, as you can

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.700
see on the slide, which took

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.620
place from 1986 until 1994,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.280
they formed the basis of the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.040
World Trade Organization.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.980
At present, the WTO membership is

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.200
already 150 countries, which shows

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.760
the interest of all the countries in

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.060
the world, which maintain active

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.140
foreign trade relations, to be included

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.400
in the negotiation processes

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.080
and interest in participation

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.320
in the World Trade Organization.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.880
Most of the WTO member countries

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.140
were members of the General

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.120
Agreement on Trade Tariffs,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.620
but a certain number

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.100
of countries joined

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.800
it quite late.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.520
If you look at the next

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.360
slide, look.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.420
Moldova joined the World

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.820
Trade Organization in

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.600
2001, and Saudi Arabia

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.440
joined in 2005.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.060
In this case, the process

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.040
of connecting in recent years has

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.480
become more complex for many countries.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.880
Why is?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.740
Because, as you have seen from the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.460
history of the development of

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.800
the World Trade Organization, negotiation

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.720
processes have been going almost since

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.340
1947.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.400
And of course, the major

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.720
WTO members who were

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.100
still on the deal for

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.980
a year, made it easier for them

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.840
to conclude their mutual agreements,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.460
precisely because they

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.400
had been negotiating

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.040
for almost decades.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.700
On this basis, a paradoxical

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.240
situation arises.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.100
Of course, new countries would like

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.480
to participate in the World

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.240
Trade Organization, but the WTO,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.640
as some integration associations,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.020
now looks very closely at those

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.960
participants who claim to join

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.120
the World Trade Organization

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.940
and try to obtain certain

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.220
preferences from new participants

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.440
in a more rigid manner.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.640
All the old members, when they

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.300
were members of the WTO, were assumed

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.920
to have reached a certain level

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.060
of tariff changes and arrangements.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.660
And the requirements for the old participants

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.080
are to some extent even less stringent.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.660
But, nevertheless, such a keen

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.380
attention is understandable.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.100
There are economic and political interests

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.820
in the participating countries, and they

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.080
are trying to get all possible preferences

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.160
from the emergence of a new country

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.220
as a member of the World

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.560
Trade Organization.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.160
The WTO is the permanent form of

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.940
member countries.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.940
This is due to the fact that

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.760
the negotiation processes, the WTO rounds,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.880
they are virtually not stopping.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.920
And, as we will then look

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.940
at the structure of the organization,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.720
the World Trade Organization,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.160
a permanent annual summit

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.340
is provided within the framework

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.700
of the World Trade Organization

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.140
to sign or agree

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.000
on some future agreements.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.860
In principle, eight rounds of

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.520
international trade negotiations

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.800
have been held since 1995.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.260
The last round, which is still

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.140
in effect, is called the Millennium

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.500
Round or the Pre-Round, which

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.600
began in 2000.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.180
The goal of the Dohrund

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.440
is to liberalize trade

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.000
in agricultural products.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.840
In general, this is the most painful

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.140
problem associated with the activities

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.380
of the members of the World

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.700
Trade Organization.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.160
Until now, most countries of

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.460
the World Trade Organization

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.340
(WTO) have supported certain

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.980
protectionist measures to protect

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.320
national agricultural producers,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.480
believing that their

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.160
conditions of production

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.960
are so difficult that the state

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.120
is obliged to support them

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.720
and stimulate the development

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.100
of domestic agricultural

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.780
production.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.180
A study conducted by the World Bank

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.300
in the late 1990s on the model

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.200
of liberalization showed that

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.500
there are possibly three options

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.220
for developments.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.700
The first option is the general and complete

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.120
liberalization of international

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.600
economic relations.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.000
The second option is intermediate

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.660
when liberalization reaches the

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.580
average level.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.460
So, under the forecast

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.760
of specialists, if agricultural

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.940
barriers are removed, then

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.620
the developing countries, including

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.200
the new market economy,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.280
I mean Russia, are the

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.560
winners.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.620
From this, it is clear what serious

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.760
interests are facing within the

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.500
challenges of

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.020
agricultural liberalization.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.280
This is Europe, as the EU

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.600
is known to spend 50% of its

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.800
pan-European budget on

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.760
supporting its

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.680
agricultural producers.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.700
At the same time, the United

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.900
States, walking and accusing Europe

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.840
of such direct protectionism

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.320
of support and support

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.000
of its agricultural yet the United

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.920
States also in the late 1990s

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.620
conducted an internal program

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.440
for modernization of agriculture,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.720
to stimulate the intensification

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.300
of production and accordingly

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.600
within this program were

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.520
options of financial

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.980
support of agricultural

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.020
common goal of the World

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.300
Trade Organization.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.800
The main objective of the

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.600
agreement is to further liberalize

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.940
world trade and ensure

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.480
fair competition.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.160
As we discussed with you within the

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.800
course of international economic relations

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.900
the principle that the second

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.300
best is not given, namely better than

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.640
liberal economic relations,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.720
which implies the rapid development

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.820
of export import relations

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.940
has not yet been invented by mankind.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.360
The other

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:52.840
o o.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.620
This is the conduct of multilateral

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.140
trade negotiations in order to

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.680
eventually make further decisions

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.060
on the liberalization

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.460
of international economic relations,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.360
the settlement of trade disputes

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.760
undoubtedly does not lead

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.680
to an improvement of the welfare

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.200
of any parties who participate

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.520
in these trade wars here usually

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.320
lose both the country of

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.460
import and the country of

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.080
export following the functional

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.680
direction of activity

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.320
in the same.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:26.660
o o.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.220
This is a rather interesting

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.560
direction of monitoring of the

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.680
national trade policy of countries,

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.940
about which I will tell

more in detail later

by the developing country

export-related assistance

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.880

this case this technical

assistance concerns

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.540
first and foremost international

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.380
trade.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:05.600
o o.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.260
and the units that are

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.960
in the

The main advantages of membership

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.060
in the first place here can

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.200
be distinguished such as the

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.720
cornerstone advantages in the

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.000
first relationship between

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.260
the member countries in the second

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.140
place.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.480
o o.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.000
more predictable because it is assumed

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.840
that before signing an agreement

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.320
within the framework of the

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.700
o o.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.720
All parties who are interested in

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.660
this so to say, signing this

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.380
agreement they must consult definitely

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.700
does not mean that all 150

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.800
member countries in the treaty.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.220


00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.320
o o.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.640
In the current state so to say will

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.320
be here so here each other to sign

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.900
an agreement is supposed that

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.720
from this group will simply stand

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.700
out for example a group of countries

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.440
that are interested in that

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.600
aspect which are being developed

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.700
at this moment of time well in this

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.640
case as an example here as a case

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.180
let us assume an agreement

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.000
on liberalization of agricultural

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.740
products not all 150 countries

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.460
well there may be those who

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.800
are exporters or fierce

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.680
importers of agricultural

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.240
products will take part in

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.620
these negotiations so that

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.360
the predictability

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.320
of trade relations it in this

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.860
case guaranteed correctly

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.300
prescribed in the t.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.360
o o.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.920
And here in this same section we must

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.520
talk about the transparency of the

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.040
foreign economic policy of the

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.260
member countries which is supported

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.400
by various activities

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.600
in the country.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:48.700
o o.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.800
In particular, this is the analysis

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.780
of foreign trade policy which is

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.720
regularly conducted for one country

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.280
or another eliminating

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.300
discrimination in trade is also

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.320
an advantage since the principle

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.100
of non-discrimination is the

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.900
second supposed principle of the

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.420
seven trade organization

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.220
which implies that unreasonable

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.740
discriminatory measures

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.040
cannot be applied against

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.710
member countries.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.230
o o.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.210
In the resolution of disputes, this

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.590
advantage is undoubtedly wanted to be obtained

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:37.110
by all those countries that are negotiating

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.910
the entry into the World Trade Organization

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.070
and the last advantage which can be

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.190
called in the category of the main

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.890
is the participation in the development

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.870
of these very agreements, that

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.790
is, the participation in international

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.190
trade negotiations is undoubtedly

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.790
a member of the WTO.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:02.130
o o.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.570
It is easier to hear than an

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.870
outsider from this organization

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.910
what is the legal basis of

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.090
the World Trade Organization

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.070
system.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.170
o o.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.310
It could be called a multilateral

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.890
contract which involves the signing

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.550
of a whole package of agreements

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.030
with practical norms and most

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:32.770
countries in the world as I have

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.050
already said 150 of the most active

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.190
trading partners and 97 percent

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.710
of the world trade is controlled

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.070
by the World Trade Organization

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.010
within the scope of these rules,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.470
well as an example at least

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.530
here is the Hurricane Round which

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.830
is based on the WTO.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:53.410
o o.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.970
There are about 50 agreements which

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.660
are the principles of decision-making

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.520
of the World Trade Organization in

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.060
this case this method of

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.780
consensus that is assumed that there

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.320
are very long negotiations

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.500
between all the States

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.100
parties and the decision is

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.640
not imposed on the party who is

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.440
interested in making this decision

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.560
is assumed that it is probably better

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.940
to strike all disputed issues remove

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.580
them than to leave some losing party

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.240
that the same minority who is dissatisfied

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.900
and not satisfied with the

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.600
adoption of the decision that

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.640
the World Trade Organization will

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.040
assume in principle within

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.520
the charters of the World Trade

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.160
Organization is possible to use

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.140
the method of voting by the adoption

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.780
of decisions based on the

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.660
majority of votes but within

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.860
the World Trade Organization

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.680
so far that such practice

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.820
was not exactly consensus allows

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.940
to conclude such contractual

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.040
relations which are stable

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.520
and which are satisfied

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.160
all the countries

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.220
members of the WTO

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.160
o o.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.000
What is the organizational

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.580
structure of decision-

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.200
making within the WTO is

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.620
first of all a ministerial

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.280
conference which meets once

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.080
two years and it is the ministerial

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.700
conference that performs the

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.020
function of a legislative

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.240
body, trade ministers gather

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.940
and multilateral agreements

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.660
packages are signed or

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.320
just negotiations are conducted

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.460
on some issue in order

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.140
to further remove those

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.920
issues that at this time

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.120
of the negotiation round were

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.780
not resolved in this

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.880
case it is just a legislative

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.020
body, then all the units

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.840
of the WTO are not

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.220
a legislative body but is

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.640
only an executive

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.960
with aiding so-called

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.600
state structures that

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.580
help implement the decision

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.460
of the World Trade

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.880
Organization this is the

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.980
general council as the

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.780
main executive body in

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.080
which usually include

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.900
ambassadors and heads

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.340
of delegations see please

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.060
the slide which represents

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.360
the most generalized

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.640
structure of the

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.740
World Trade Organization

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.080
and so the

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.600
minist

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.520
As the executive body the

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.140
General Council is connected with

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.840
three functional boards, this

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.420
Board of Trade is a Board of Trade

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.920
for Goods and Services and

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.740
a Council for Trade Aspects

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.400
of Intellectual Property Rights

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.920
in addition to such auxiliary

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:11.000
there are the Trade and Development

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.020
Committee and Budget Committee

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.480
and other which assist

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.760
the General Council in

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.220
the same.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.840
To perform its administrative functions

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.520
as I have already said, there is

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.660
a secretariat means a world

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.000
trade function and it does not decide

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.000
this service body let us now turn

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.540
to the issue of Russian foreign

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.280
trade in order to finally understand

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.540
why Russia needs to join the

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.140
World Trade Organization on

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.440
the one hand and we have considered

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.420
a whole block of advantages

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.020
that members receive

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.300
in the WTO.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.380
and the

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.440
end of

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.360
the product

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.580
is the

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.140
first

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.940
of all,

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.500
if the

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.260
metal

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.720
and the

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.200
products

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.560
of the

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.220
company

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.900
are increased

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.600
by the

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.340
basis

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.780
of the

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.660
industry

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.280
and the

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.640
structure

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.160
of the

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.340
products

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.500
is generated

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.220
by the

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.940
industry,

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.260
the

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.780
second

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.420
is the

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.400
same

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.380
as the

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.920
country's

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.780
capacity

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:29.020
to produce

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.380
the world's

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.200
products,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.460
but

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.360
on

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.680
the

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.020
other

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.860
hand,

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.760
the

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.740
country's

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.120
capacity

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.960
to produce

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.180
the

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.560
world's

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.280
products

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.700
is the

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.520
same

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.260
as the

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.330
the

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.150
most

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.190
expensive

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.310
companies

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.050
are

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.570
the

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.750
most

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.930
expensive

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.170


00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.470


00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.910


00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.490


00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.310


00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.410


00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.250


00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.850


00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.470


00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.770


00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.030


00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.710


00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.990


00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.510


00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.970


00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.010


00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.050


00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.000


00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.260
In principle, this scheme can change

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:39.440
with the general development

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.400
of foreign economic relations and

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.100
we will draw your attention to the

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.880
fact that countries that were previously

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.420
members of the Council of economic

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.640
mutual assistance and in general

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.180
were part of the socialist circle,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.340
they are either already members of

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.190
the World Trade Organization

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.600
or claim to join the

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.360
World Trade Organization.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.040
Thus, they also already received

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.640
the advantages that Russia is trying

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:14.420
to get by joining the WTO.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.160
And these advantages should

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.780
also boost their foreign trade turnover.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.960
And it seems that relations with

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.600
these countries could be more developed.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.800
These countries are usually

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.080
located closely with our

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.480
country.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.620
Accordingly, the costs of

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.620
transportation of goods, transportation

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.480
costs are quite low.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.520
This is an absolute advantage,

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.960
it is not yet fully used.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:52.440
Moreover, the salary level in these countries

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.660
is much lower than in developed

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.240
countries.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.100
Therefore, this is another

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:01.600
absolute advantage that makes

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.420
products produced in the territory

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.160
of countries close to Russia

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.560
more competitive.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.540
And if the positive development

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:15.660
trends in these countries begin

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.240
to grow, it is possible that the

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:25.380
country range for Russia will

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.300
change over time.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.240
Look at the Russian foreign

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.520
economic indicators.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.740
As you can see, in the last five years,

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.320
the situation has changed a bit.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.000
If Russia had a mostly positive

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.820
trade balance before 2003,

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:50.880
the foreign trade balance

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.540
has been negative

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.400
since 2004.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.060
What are the reasons for this situation?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:06.900
The elements of this situation are related

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.740
to the economic growth in Russia,

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.040
which has been recorded since 2004.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.000
Within the framework of economic theory,

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.640
it has always been proven that

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.020
as soon as the gross domestic product

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.420
of a country begins to grow, not only

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.320
the domestic demand in the national

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.860
market, but also the demand for

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:27.560
imports.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.080
And just confirmation of this axiom

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.980
from the theory of international

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:35.740
economic relations is manifested

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:39.120
in the foreign economic indicators

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.440
of Russia.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.460
Most importantly, our

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.440
manufacturers agree

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.920
to buy a larger share

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.040
of imported products in

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.260
order to raise both their

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.920
standard of living and

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.500
to upgrade the production

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.640
that should be more

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.140
competitive.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.420
Another factor that affects the fact

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.320
that since 2004 the foreign trade

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.980
balance has become negative is

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.300
due to the fact that the Russian

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:25.080
ruble rate is increasing methodically.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.020
Despite the intervention that the Central

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.040
Bank regularly carries out in the

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.640
foreign exchange market, it is still

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.520
not possible to reduce this exchange

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.720
rate sharply enough.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.920
We considered that if the currency

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.820
rate of a country increases, then

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.680
one way or another this leads to

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:51.020
a tendency to decrease somewhat,

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.420
a decrease in exports and

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.920
a rise in imports.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.320
Why is?

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.300
Because the ruble is becoming more

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.480
expensive and now we can

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.160
exchange more foreign currency for

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.920
a more stable, expensive ruble.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.960
And, accordingly, buy more

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.460
imported goods.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.640
The foreign consumer of

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.840
Russian exports is facing a situation

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.540
where the goods offered by Russian

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:23.260
production have not only increased

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.020
in connection with the increase

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.500
in global prices, I mean energy,

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.960
and other groups of Russian

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.820
exports have increased

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.500
precisely because now to

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.880
buy this goods at the same

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.260
price, you need to exchange

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.920
more euros or dollars

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.500
for rubles.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.220
This leads to a relative increase in

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.680
the price of goods.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.340
This situation is also known

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.600
for Europe, when Europeans

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.780
are not satisfied with the rise

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.660
of the euro against the US dollar.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.660
They even calculated how many millions

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.920
of euros they lost just from

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.280
the six-month rise of

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:07.600
the US dollar.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.940
The same situation is not beneficial to us.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.240
But I want to draw your attention to the

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.020
fact that during this period of time,

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:19.200
2006-2007, the rise in the ruble rate is not

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.360
only related to the growth of our exports,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.420
but also to the growth of Russia.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.220
It is also due to the fact that the currencies

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.680
of our foreign partners, in particular

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:40.600
the United States, are subject to fluctuation.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.140
The period 2006-2005 was marked by

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.240
the fact that in this period of

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.360
time the dollar rate was steadily

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:50.500
declining.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.240
On the one hand, the Americans

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.200
gained export gains from such a

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.400
reduction in the ruble rate and

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.080
slightly improved their payment and

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.240
trade balance.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.420
The US partners, especially Russia,

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.480
should have suffered from this

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.840
situation.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:13.940
As you can see from the table,

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.780
our net exports increased in

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:21.600
negative, it became unbalanced.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.240
As the US market is going to be

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.760
moving, this trend was already

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.620
marked in 2007, when the US

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.360
Central Bank has already raised

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.100
the refinancing

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:39.540
rate by a percentage point,

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.360
which allows to balance

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.440
Russia's foreign trade

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.460
flows.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.400
But as you can see, exports and

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.180
imports are influenced by a large

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.700
number of factors, both currency

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:56.200
and demand.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.040
In terms of demand, I would like

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.120
to point out that the growth of

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.000
our exports will still depend

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.740
on the growth of the gross domestic

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.340
product abroad.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.740
That is, as far as countries, the

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.280
main consumers of our exports,

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.540
I mean Western Europe, as you

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.120
saw on the chart, this is 60%

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.940
of our exports, as far as

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.900
Western Europe will maintain stable

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:27.320
exports in the Western European

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:28.480
market, will enjoy

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.140
demand.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.500
If, God give it, their development

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.680
is somehow disrupted and there is some

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.480
economic decline, then our exports

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.520
may be reduced even more,

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.880
and for us this will be an

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.580
unwanted situation.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.860
From my example, you can see

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.420
how closely connected

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.640
all countries in the world are

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.680
by export import flows.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.420
Therefore, in principle, the common

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.860
prosperity of one country cannot be

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:01.300
without the prosperity of neighbors and

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.360
more distant neighbors, since these

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.540
interrelated export and import flows

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.520
raise the overall economic development

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.740
of all countries in the world.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:17.060
Based on this, it is clear why countries,

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.560
outsiders, world trade organizations

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.820
are trying to join this integration

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.920
process negotiating and participating

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.840
in the World Trade Organization

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.480
rauts, to be an equal

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.160
member of the World

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:34.680
Trade Organization.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:40.190
Look at the following chart, what

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.830
the dynamics of export-import in the

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.430
last period of time.

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:52.470
The balance of foreign trade

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.390
is generally positive.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.910
As you can see, these red-

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.650
yellow stripes reflect the positive

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.110
balance of foreign

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.090
trade on the chart.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:12.370
And this is due to the fact that prices

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.910
are generally on a positive balance

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.130
of the year 2005.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:22.110
Prices of Russian exports have

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.790
increased.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:27.870
Based on this, the volume of Russian

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.630
value exports in some periods

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.390
of time increases due to the price

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.170
jump.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.590
Pay attention to 2007.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.350
In January, both imports

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.530
and exports fell.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.110
Probably it is tradition.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.590
See again in January

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.250
2005.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:49.110
This is a tradition of falling demand

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.710
during Christmas some New Year period

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.550
of time, and then the trend of international

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.790
trade is gaining strength

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.290
again.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:01.890
What are the objectives and objectives of Russia'

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.930
s accession to the World Trade Organization?

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:07.390
Of course, these goals can be

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.890
formulated in the system by

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.890
the benefits that any country that

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.990
has become a member of the World

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.810
Trade Organization receives.

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:20.810
The first goal is to obtain

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.690
non-discriminatory conditions

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.730
for access to foreign markets

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.550
for Russian products.

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.750
As I have already given an example,

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.750
there are quite strict rules

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.830
of discrimination on a number

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.110
of goods that are quite

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.470
competitive in the world market.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.050
Furthermore, access to the mechanism

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:49.690
for settling trade disputes, which

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.590
is well-developed within

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.570
the framework of the World Trade

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.630
Organization, is very important

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.990
for Russia and is not accidentally

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.550
used by more and more

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.030
WTO member countries.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.270
On the other hand, if we become

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.150
members of the WTO, it means that

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.410
most countries in the world do

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.210
not conflict with us on trade

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.510
and other positions that fall

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.930
within the jurisdiction

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.110
of the WTO.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.010
Our foreign

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.130
policy is becoming

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.570
more predictable.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.650
When countries join the World Trade

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.290
Organization, one of the requirements

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.010
in the WTO process is the harmonization

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:41.610
of domestic laws with WTO rules

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.650
and norms, with international

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.870
standards.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.690
International standards

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.770
envisage the liberalization

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.970
of domestic legislation in

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.430
relation to foreign investors.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.370
Thus, creating a favorable

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.010
clearing for investment is

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.670
also one of the goals of Russia'

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.350
s accession to the WTO.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.370
If you look at the statistics,

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.270
investors have reacted

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.850
very strongly to the fact that in

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.270
2006-2007 Russia was facing

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.050
a stormy conviction with

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.590
all conflicting countries about

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.590
joining the WTO.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:28.190
The influx of foreign investment

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.250
into Russia grew to almost 40%

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.270
in the first quarter of 2007 compared

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.970
to the first quarter of 2006.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.970
Why this happens?

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.730
It appears that foreign investors

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.830
are expecting Russia's accession

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.050
to the WTO and are trying to take

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.510
positions in advance.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.730
There is also a flow of reinvestments.

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:53.730


00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.190
When domestic producers who

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:00.110
exported excess capital

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.770
abroad because they saw less

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.250
risky use of this capital

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.790
on Russian territory,

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.790
they were less likely to

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.930
invest money abroad, this

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.210
capital also begins to

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.910
return to the Russian

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.970
economy.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.630
This process began in 2003

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.170
and continues to this day.

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:26.530
Accordingly, the WTO membership

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:29.030
will be a laxmuse paper,

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.330
an indicator that will show

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.370
foreign investors

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.110
to come, invest, develop,

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.830
organize, create new

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.650
jobs on modern technologies

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.710
in Russia.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:43.530
Someone is scared of the

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.090
arrival of foreign investments

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.650
in Russian territory.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.070
But note, even with this seemingly

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.010
stormy growth, what numbers we

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.070
can give – 10, 20, 30% growth

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.610
over the last few years, yet

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.610
the share of foreign investment

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.550
in the overall investment

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.510
of the domestic economy

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.430
is insignificant.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:10.850
The percentage there rises a little to

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:12.070
10%.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.510
This is why Russia does

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.570
not experience such an

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.550
investment risk.

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:20.950
Well, if we recall the examples of

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.910
new industrialized countries that

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.090
have rapidly developed exports of developing

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.930
industries, and not raw materials,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.030
namely industrial, these exports

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.490
developed industries were created

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:36.890
at the expense of foreign

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.830
investments.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.630
Russia has a good opportunity

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.010
to implement such

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.750
investment plans.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.990
In addition to the fact that these plans

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.590
will be beneficial to domestic consumers,

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.290
but it is also possible that Russian

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.210
products will go to the foreign

00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.590
market from such imported sources

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.350
of production.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:06.330
What does it have to do with?

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.550
First of all, in Russia, sufficiently

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.650
developed, educated industrial

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.210
personnel.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:18.290
And while we have not yet spread

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.570
this potential, it is possible

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.770
that when training personnel in

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.670
accordance with new technologies

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.510
of marketing and management, which

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.610
occurs in a number of

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.610
our domestic enterprises, will

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.470
attract domestic workforce

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.630
and will attract foreign investors

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.370
in Russia not only cheap raw

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.810
materials and energy, but also

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.810
the possibility of organizing

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.210
such competitive production.

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.270
The next factor that will affect Russia'

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.330
s accession to the WTO is the

00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:02.410
possibility of increasing Russian

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.070
investments in WTO member countries.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.030


01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:09.050
I have already said in the

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.290
course of international economic

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.730
relations that transnational corporations

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.150
are represented not only in the

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.150
Western economy and in the group

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.530
of developing countries.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:25.730
In Russia, they are called

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.330
international monopolies,

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.650
and financial and industrial

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.490
groups are called.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.270
So the financial and industrial

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.530
groups of Russia also feel some

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.870
limitation of Russia's territorial

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.110
capabilities and agree

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.770
to invest abroad.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:45.170
The next task of Russia's accession

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.130
to the WTO is related to expanding

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.930
opportunities for Russian investors

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.870
in WTO member countries.

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.050
The situation in the Russian economy

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.370
is so that our transnational

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.310
corporations, which I have already

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.190
mentioned in the section of international

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.350
economic relations, are also

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.810
facing a situation when they do

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.070
not find adequate spheres of

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.430
application with their capital

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.270
on the territory of Russia.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.910
On the other hand, given that

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.010
our transnational corporations are

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.170
closely related to gas and

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.590
the sector, namely, for example,

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.390
to Gazprom, the construction

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:27.530
and investment of this corporation

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.690
involves facilitating

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.030
the export of Russian

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.710
gas abroad.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.790
Therefore, the expansion of such

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.090
opportunities for investment

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.790
in WTO member countries is also a

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.850
significant factor for the

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.590
Russian economy.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:56.730
The establishment of cooperative

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.150
ties between WTO member countries

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.190
with the inclusion of Russia in

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.530
this industrial cooperation can be linked

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.330
to Russian investments in

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:08.730
the countries and in the NGO.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.370
Therefore, this is

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.990
a fairly progressive, positive

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.690
process, and Russia can look

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.530
in this direction from

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.530
the WTO accession.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.990
The next factor of Russia's participation

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.910
in the WTO is the creation of conditions

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.190
for improving the quality

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.570
and competitiveness of the reporting products.

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:36.570
After all, if the relations of the member

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.270
countries of the World Trade Organization

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.390
require liberalization of foreign

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.490
trade, then the same requirement will

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.150
be introduced to our country.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.110
Of course, the level of liberalization

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.810
of our foreign trade relations is

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.570
already high enough, but once again,

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.330
the access of those foreign competitors

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.850
to our market will make domestic

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.390
producers think about increasing

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.290
the competitiveness

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.450
of their products.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:08.190
And despite the fact that of course,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.090
such a harsher competition from the

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.430
part of foreigners after Russia's

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.950
accession to the WTO will not occur

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.310
immediately, since each new member

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.270
country receives the right to

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.730
a certain transitional period,

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.670
in the presence of which its producers

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.810
will adapt to the new situation.

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:32.650
However, many manufacturers are

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.350
already thinking about the future

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.490
and increasing competition in the

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.270
Russian market.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.730
This is reflected in the fact that

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.490
on the territory of the Russian

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.710
regions are held regular meetings

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.030
at the level of heads of regions and

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.190
various communities of Russian

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:05.170
industrialists of regional location.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.030
So, these meetings, these consultations,

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.670
they allow Russian producers

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.150
to find out what

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.010
risks the WTO membership brings

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.990
to them, and on the other

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.790
hand, what advantages.

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:21.990
And as reports on such meetings

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.910
show, it turns out, often

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.510
Russian industrialists

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.470
and manufacturers have limited

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.510
information about the advantages

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.930
that the WTO gives and their

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.330
idea of how and in

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.530
what ways, what steps Russia

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.130
will enter the WTO, about what

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.330
barriers will remain

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.310
for the transitional period,

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.970
are quite limited.

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:51.690
Based on this, such consultations

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.510
with Russian industrial manufacturers

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.110
occurring throughout the territory

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.750
of Russia, they promote the

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.730
understanding of this process

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.530
and produce a positive response

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.370
and feedback.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.210
That is, on the one hand, to accept

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.970
this situation as more

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.710
promising for the development of

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:13.410
Russia, and on the other hand,

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.090
to think about how to

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.510
increase the competitiveness

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.950
of its own production.

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.270
As analytical studies show,

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.690
less than 50% of Russian

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.910
manufacturers thought

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.750
about Russia's entry into

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.590
the WTO five years ago.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.630
At present, this figure has increased

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.570
sharply, and everyone understands,

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.390
on the one hand, what advantages,

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.110
and on the other hand, what shortcomings

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.070
are related to their organizational

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.970
activities and how prepared

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.130
or not prepared for Russia's accession

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.050
to the WTO.

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.670
The next factor and task that will

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.450
be solved in the framework of Russia'

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.510
s accession to the WTO is Russia'

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.010
s participation in the development of

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.350
international trade rules

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.110
and in compliance with the defense of

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.410
its national interests.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.350
I have already mentioned that the Doha

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.410
Round is dedicated to developing

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.170
the problems of liberalization of agriculture.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:26.790
In this case, Russia, rich in land

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.190
and natural agricultural

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.930
resources and opportunities, has a

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.250
high potential for the development

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.430
of its agricultural sector and its

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:41.290
development not only in the

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.150
direction of ensuring domestic

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.730
consumption, but also penetration

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.450
into the European market.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:52.250
As the latest history of Russia shows,

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:56.030
our agricultural workers do not

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.610
constantly experience the situation of crisis.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.350
Each time period is repeated

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.970
a fairly high harvest.

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:08.990
But, as practice shows, often

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:11.530
public procurement

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.670
of agricultural products does

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.110
not cover the excess supply of

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.510
grain and other

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.370
agricultural goods.

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:21.390
And then for the next

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.910
year, farmers simply reduce

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.190
the volume of their production

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.910
supply.

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:29.410
As I said in my course on international

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.550
economic relations, such

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.630
a surplus situation in the

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.950
world free space is usually

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.530
solved by the fact that such

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.270
naturally created surpluses

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.990
and the hard work of Russian

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.350
agricultural workers can

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.550
be realized precisely

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.950
by export.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.190
Russia, in fact, within these all

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.310
sorts of quota restrictions such

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.770
chances do not have or have

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.710
very limited scale.

01:07:56.790 --> 01:07:59.010
In the end, this leads to negative

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.090
consequences, in essence, to

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.550
overproduction in some periods,

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.930
in some years in agriculture

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.790
and to the ruin of these

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.810
agricultural ones.

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:13.250
The next component of, say, the

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:17.690
benefits for Russia from joining

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.110
the World Trade Organization

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.810
is the improvement of Russia'

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.610
s image as a full participant

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.810
in international

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.350
trade.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.850
While Russia is not a WTO

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.690
member, some countries, some

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.970
governments, or some economic

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.490
agents from some countries have

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:43.490
the opportunity to discriminate

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.230
against Russia and, accordingly,

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.750
to prove some of their

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.790
rights to discriminate

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.670
against trade flows.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.890
In this case, the most case-proof

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.950
example of Russia's accession

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.550
to the WTO is the amendment of the

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.430
INC in the United States, according

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.390
to which once on the yet socialist Russia

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.630
were imposed restrictions on export

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.050
of advanced technologies, on discrimination,

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.910
on export-import relations

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.210
in connection with the restrictions

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.890
that Russia then imposed

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.930
on the exit of Jews from Russia.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:35.170
In this case, despite the fact that

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.190
Russia recognizes a market economy

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.630
in a new thousand words, not

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.090
a transitional transformational

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:45.070
economy, the amendment still works.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.550
And the amendment of Jones Venik

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.370
is a precedent to the discriminatory

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.310
attitude of Russia, although each

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.350
year by the order of the president

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.050
of the United States this amendment

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.530
is suspended, but it is nevertheless

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.150
not eliminated.

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:05.690
Despite the fact that, suppose, the negotiations

01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:08.490
of Russia and the United States on Russia's accession

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.450
to the WTO have already been completed,

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.130
and the precedent of the amendment remains.

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:15.950
And the US says that only when Russia becomes

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.050
a WTO member, we will then eliminate

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.470
this amendment.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.430
In this case, there is no longer

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.290
the country against which the amendment

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.890
was introduced, the object of this amendment

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.030
has changed.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.790
Nevertheless, this political

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.670
pressure persists, and in this

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:34.650
case, the image of confrontation

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.790
for Russia, when it enters

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.790
some international economic

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.170
relations, remains.

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:47.870
What are the main objectives of the negotiations

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.110
on Russia's accession to the WTO?

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:53.330
First of all, as I said, we need to

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.370
weigh the price of accession, that

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.150
is, what benefits and advantages

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.810
Russia will get from joining the

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.310
WTO, to these benefits and advantages.

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:05.010
What concessions is Russia

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.010
prepared to make for this

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:08.930
accession?

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.990
To what level should it lower

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.210
tariffs and to what extent, so to

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.270
speak, has it opened the

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.290
domestic markets?

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:18.950
We remember that the World Trade

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.410
Organization does not mean such

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.070
a consistent liberalization

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.550
of international economic relations

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.230
and foreign trade.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.490
Despite the fact that all countries

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.630
have adopted agreements on GAD, GAC,

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.850
TRIPS, TRIMS, however, each country in

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.130
a certain period of time introduces

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.830
those restrictions that they consider

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.790
reasonable, justified, and within

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.250
the framework of coordination

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.530
with the WTO these restrictions pass.

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:51.770
In this case, the task of Russian representatives

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.830
in the negotiations is to great

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.010
advantages or at least to balance

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.010
the situation of losses and benefits

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.210
of Russia's withdrawal

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.930
from the WTO.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.880
Regarding the GATT Goods Agreement,

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:16.800
I would like to draw your attention

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.060
to the fact that the General

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:23.540
Agreement of 1947, as I have said,

01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.680
was the basis for the agreement

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:32.660
of countries' accession to the

01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:34.380
World Trade Organization.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.400
But before the World Trade

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:39.200
Organization was established there

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.700
was a new round of negotiations,

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:45.580
and the 1994 General Agreement

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:51.120
contains additional positions.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.160
First, the 1994 agreement

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.140
contains specific sector

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:02.040
agreements, namely agriculture

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:04.080
and textiles.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.340
In this regard, Russia, joining the

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.280
WTO at the present stage, rather than

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.000
before 1995, receives some

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:19.300
advantages in this area, in the

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:24.080
development of an agreement

01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:26.980
on agriculture and textile.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:30.460
The next component of the 1994

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.600
GAD is state trade.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.240
There are negative points for Russia

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.220
here, because within these agreements,

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:43.460
government orders on foreign

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.960
trade must be distributed

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.580
on a market basis.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:51.040
The tradition of the Russian

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:53.120
economy is associated

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.740
with a certain vulgarism of officials

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.080
who distribute certain

01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:01.960
state supplies and orders.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.840
The next issue is related to the

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:07.660
standards for different products.

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.180
The Russian standards have traditionally

01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:13.080
been quite high.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.660
Conditionally speaking, such a primitive

01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.500
example, as the amount of meat

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:19.380
in the high quality Russian sausage,

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:22.600
it is usually higher than the same

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.540
standards, for example, concerning

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.480
the European Union.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.440
But the same standards, quite

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.900
strict, are introduced

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:35.360
on medicines.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.040
And it is not by chance that, for

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:41.060
example, India recently entered into the discussion

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.740
of agreements on Russia's accession

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.480
to the WTO under the GAD section.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.960
India is the largest

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:50.700
exporter of

01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:51.840
medicines.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.320
And if Russia stands in the position

01:14:57.330 --> 01:14:59.500
of adopting such international

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:01.400
standards, which are usually accepted

01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:03.280
in the World Trade Organization, and

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.820
lower some of its standards, it

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.960
is likely that this country will

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.920
have a greater opportunity to

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.440
penetrate the Russian market.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.840
As for subsidies.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.560
Indeed, the 1994 agreement

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:23.340
also includes subsidy

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.940
issues.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.280
Subsidies are the most painful

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:31.500
issue in the General Agreement

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:34.160
on Tariffs and Trade and in the

01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:36.520
current negotiations of the

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.320
Doha round.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:38.840
Why is?

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.980
First of all, it is

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.500
about agricultural

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:43.620
export subsidies.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.080
And, of course, Russia, becoming

01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:48.620
a participant in these negotiations,

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.560
can get certain preferences.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.760
And now before the accession,

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.240
it must agree on what level

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.820
to fix the same protective barriers

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:58.760
in order that agriculture in

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:01.120
Russia is sufficiently well

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:05.520
protected and entitled to subsidies.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.540
The next aspect, which was linked

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:10.900
to the new GAD 1994 edition,

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:13.040
is anti-dumping measures.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:15.660
In this regard, Russia has made

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:17.400
a great progress, because in the

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.080
new XXI century anti-dumping legislation

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.820
and various regulatory

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:25.880
acts were adopted that regulate,

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:28.040
so to speak, the rules of

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:30.700
recognition of dumping on the

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:33.320
territory of Russia and the introduction

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.820
of anti-dumping sanctions.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.100
I have already said that Russian

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:43.540
export flows are quite strongly limited

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:46.760
in different directions, and

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.780
not only in the direction of the United

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:50.440
States and Western Europe,

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:53.020
but even in the direction of the

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:55.100
Asian region, to new developed

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.020
countries.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.180
Once the countries have been

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.480
able to develop their heavy industry

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:03.880
thoroughly enough, obstacles are

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:06.200
set and proved by the dumping

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.420
situation on, for example,

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.980
Russian goods, in particular,

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:13.500
metal production.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.720
Now, of course, in general, in connection

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:20.040
with the rise of world prices

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:21.920
for various commodity-intensive

01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:24.360
goods, which are the main component

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.120
of Russian exports, such

01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:30.300
dumping claims from buyers,

01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:33.020
these countries-importers are

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.780
coming to Russia less and less.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.700
This is due to the fact that, for example,

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.680
mostly disputes with Russia

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:45.940
about dumping were from the 90s to 95s.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.040
It was during this period that Russia

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.260
was accused of a fairly large

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:53.240
number of dumping charges, and it

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:56.080
was ignored that the country at

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.880
that time was no longer a centralized

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:00.940
socialist economy, and indeed

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:02.160
the exporters used some

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:03.680
of their specific advantages

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:05.800
associated with cheap

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.640
raw materials of cheap

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.000
labor.

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:11.420
But since Russia was not yet recognized

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.020
as a market economy at that time,

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:16.340
these anti-dumping processes were

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.860
heard and decisions were made

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:21.200
on recognizing the dumping,

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:23.480
and Russian exporters were punished

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.860
seriously enough and thus restricted

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:27.160
the flow of exports from Russia,

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:29.440
which at that time was in a

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:31.040
sufficiently crisis situation,

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:32.860
and for her, of course, export

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.580
revenues were significant

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.660
and important in order

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:39.740
to maintain some economic

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.140
balance economic situation

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.280
in Russia itself.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.720
The fundamental principles of the GAD, as

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:49.700
I have said, are the principle of

01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:52.940
non-discrimination, which is

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:54.500
implemented through the application

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.260
of the regime and the greatest favor.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.820
In this case, having obtained this

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:04.400
option, Russia will be able

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:10.720
to protect itself from various

01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:12.300
claims on dumping.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.560
The principle of national regime will

01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:17.700
again allow at least to remove

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.920
the amendment of the Venice

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.280
or some other restrictive

01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.920
legislative acts that act against

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:26.820
Russian exports.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.820
The abolition of quantitative restrictions

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.220
in favor of tariffs.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.680
In this case, this principle of GAD

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:36.040
in Russian exports is already strong

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.100
enough and is present in Russian imports.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.540
In fact, the new tariff legislation

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:42.300
during the last period of time

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:47.880
in this period of time we have tried

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.600
to bring all our tariffs in line

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.700
to prepare Russia's accession

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.420
to the WTO and, of course,

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:56.120
to come to the tariffization

01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:02.000
of the system of external

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.500
economic barriers as

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:06.020
much as possible.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.400
The principle of publicity, transparency

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:13.840
in tariff matters, including in

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:16.740
trade and development

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:18.780
of foreign trade legislation is,

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.920
of course, a principle that in

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:25.640
Russia cannot be solved in one day.

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.900
And at least these are the agreements

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.600
that are taking place within

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:33.280
the WTO, they help the

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:35.700
Russian economy and Russian law

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:38.960
to be more outspoken and transparent.

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:41.120
If you look at the fundamental principles

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.580
of the next WTO GAC agreement, i.e.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.660
services-related agreements, the purpose

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:51.920
in this case of this agreement

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.480
is free export and import

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.780
of services regardless of the

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:58.420
method of their delivery.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.220
In accordance with this,

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.200
it is assumed that not only

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:04.320
commercial structures, but also

01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:06.620
individuals can freely provide

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:09.080
services.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:15.220
Here there is a situation that

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:18.880
develops in such a way that the

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:21.540
principle of the regime of the

01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:23.400
greatest favor and the principle

01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:25.460
of the national regime is valid within

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:27.840
this agreement so far with exceptions,

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:30.340
unlike the GAD, that is, the

01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:32.960
agreement on tariffs and trade.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.300
These principles are basically

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.000
implemented only on individual

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.060
binding countries, only on

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.020
bilateral agreements.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:44.520
What sectors of the economy, what

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.820
sectors of services, to what extent

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:49.700
are ready to open up to foreign competition.

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.800
This includes such areas as

01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:55.320
banking services, insurance services.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.260
As you understand, these are

01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:00.620
large enough financial interests,

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:04.740
so countries lobby national

01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:06.460
and transnational banks and

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.040
corporations to limit the

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.200
free access of foreign competition

01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:13.940
to these areas.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:17.720
As for the TRIPS agreement,

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:19.260
Russia is trying to

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:24.220
prepare its legislation

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:27.980
and reform its legislation

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.980
to meet the requirements

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.020
of the

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:33.080
WTO.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.760
In particular, this applies to

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:38.120
the new version of the Copyright

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:42.440
Violation Act, which occurred in

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:47.760
the spring of 2007 to reduce

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:51.660
the flow of pirated products

01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:54.900
that go to the Russian

01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:57.220
audio, video and software

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:58.940
market.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.900
In this case, on the other hand,

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.000
this agreement defends the rights

01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.680
of Russian producers of

01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:09.820
similar products.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.820
The effect of this agreement, if

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.240
we join the WTO, pushes us to

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.880
ensure that in this area

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:23.780
of financial and information services

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:27.320
not only our legislation, but

01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:29.000
the actual reality is

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:31.840
in line with world standards.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.500
The TRIPS Agreement deals

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:38.680
with intellectual property

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:39.740
in a broad way.

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.300
This includes not only copyright

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:44.340
and trademarks, or, for example,

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:46.480
geographical names and the use

01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:48.700
of product denominations.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.660
Also included are industrial samples

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:53.640
design, integrated chip topology

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.280
and even unresolved information.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.540
For example, trade secrets

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:01.660
also become intellectual property.

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.020
Based on this, of course, in the conditions

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.460
of growing competition of the

01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:09.580
modern market, in the conditions

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:11.300
of the development of so-called

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:13.060
industrial or corporate espionage,

01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:17.360
the development of the rules of the

01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:20.140
game and, most importantly, the following

01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:22.780
of these rules for Russia is a factor

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:24.380
of increasing competitiveness

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:26.160
and including the competitiveness

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:28.420
of its products.

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:31.280
It is no secret that, as part of

01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:32.880
the violation of intellectual property

01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:34.040
rights of Russian production,

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:36.720
the situation in Russia was simply

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:40.020
deplorable during the period of

01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:45.560
the 98th year, when this flow

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:47.920
of intellectual information

01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:50.680
not protected by copyright

01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:53.660
literally went west by packages.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.260
And, as they say, the market of Russian

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.400
technology offerings was simply overwhelmed.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.120
Based on this, of course, the inclusion

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.080
of Russia in such an adequate

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.440
process to international standards

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:14.660
will protect not only foreign intellectual

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.280
property producers, but

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:17.800
also domestic, which will increase

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:20.600
Russia's competitiveness, and, most

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.980
importantly, in the long term will

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:24.740
allow Russia to leave such

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.100
a cliché of the factory not the

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:33.020
factory of the world, but

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:35.120
the raw material of

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.040
the world.

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.260
I would like to also focus on

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:41.100
such a component of the WTO

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:45.160
structure as the development of

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:48.720
agreements on rules for dispute

01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:50.060
resolution.

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.020
First, the settlement of

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.160
differences is made

01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:56.980
during consultation.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.980
In the second phase, the decision

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:01.920
is made by a group of experts.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.200
In the third phase, appeals are filed

01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:07.220
against the decision.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.560
The agreement on the rules of dispute

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:13.440
resolution is also a rather beneficial

01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:16.200
area for Russia after joining

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:20.500
the WTO, since the countries

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:23.940
are trusted in this dispute

01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:25.560
resolution system.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.500
If you look closely,

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:33.680
then if only 300 cases

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:37.900
were filed before 1999

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:42.580
compared with the period

01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:45.820
after 1999, only 167

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:51.360
cases were considered

01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:55.060
and filed by March

01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:58.120
1999.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.440
Thus, the trust in this system is

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:04.900
quite high, and it is very beneficial

01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:09.420
for Russia, on the basis of mutual

01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:12.120
international agreements and the balance

01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:15.100
of disputes, to come to the optimal

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.920
solution that will not contradict

01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:20.160
the interests of the Russian

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:22.000
country.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.160
The next component

01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:27.200
of the WTO agreement is the

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:29.800
mechanism for reviewing

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.600
trade policy.

01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:33.280
This is a very fundamental

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.900
study, which is conducted

01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:39.520
by WTO groups, since

01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:44.060
1995 only 45 member

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:47.080
countries have been

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.300
reviewed.

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:52.240
It is not expected that all 150 member

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:55.040
states will be subject to a permanent

01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:57.760
review of trade policy.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.620
45 countries are the world's leading countries.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.200
After all, this mechanism forces

01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:07.300
the public of the governments

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.840
of these countries to look

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:11.460
critically at the system

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.660
that is developing in the

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:16.860
field of state regulation

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.340
of foreign trade in these

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:21.340
countries.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.660
Therefore, such regular analytical

01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:27.180
studies and reviews are an

01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:29.360
important component of raising

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:33.000
the prestige of the country,

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:35.480
raising the investment attractiveness,

01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.600
if you want to trade has received

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.340
some bonuses, positive assessments,

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.520
proven increased transparency

01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:51.960
in explaining trade policy,

01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.160
then the conclusion of

01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:58.300
course acts as such a marketing

01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:00.120
move and the country has

01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:03.300
great competitive advantages

01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:05.400
when exporting its products

01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:08.420
and great competitive

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.800
advantages when inviting,

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:15.630
attracting foreign

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.110
investment to its

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.410
territory.

01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:25.410
So, let's see what advantages the WTO

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.590
trade system offers in the first place

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.350
in terms of seemingly general

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.650
conclusions.

01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:34.250
From the point of view of

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.210
consumers, first of all, as soon

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:41.090
as barriers that cross the

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:46.130
trade borders of different

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.050
countries are opened,

01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:50.150
it is assumed that products

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.650
begin to move more freely,

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.210
and therefore the supply

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.150
volume increases.

01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:57.150
The growth of supply means not only

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.130
the growth of the range, the wide

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.430
range of goods and services, but the

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.590
growth of supply on export imports

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.930
and disinfection usually means

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.310
a decrease in prices.

01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:17.550
And then the price reduction will

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.290
affect the cost of

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.190
the consumer basket or cost

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.650
of living, which will positively

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:26.870
affect the final consumers

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.270
of the national economy.

01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:32.230
But we must pay attention to the fact

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.870
that the removal of such foreign

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.910
trade barriers means a price reduction

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.350
not only for goods related to final

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:48.170
consumption, but is related to a reduction

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.570
in the prices of components that

01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:52.890
are imported into the national economy.

01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:54.910
And although the principle of

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.070
tariff escalation, which we talked

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.950
about in the course of MEO, usually

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.990
applies in national economies,

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:05.410
suggests that usually raw materials

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:08.150
and components are imported at

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.990
lower tariffs, but finished

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.830
products are closed by a

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.010
barrier with higher tariffs.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:17.330
However, the greater liberalization

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.950
of the import of component

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.910
raw materials leads to the fact

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.410
that domestic goods that

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.310
use these components are

01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:28.090
also becoming cheaper.

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:30.030
Thus, the national producer

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.910
with its commodity products

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.230
becomes more competitive

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.030
both on the domestic market

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.950
and, possibly, on the international.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:38.810


01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.170
Accordingly, from the consumer point

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.450
of view, the advantage of liberalization

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:47.730
of foreign trade is present.

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:49.710
Another component that indirectly

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.210
affects consumers

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.650
is the growth of exports.

01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:53.890
It would seem that the growth

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.330
of exports is only won by the manufacturer,

01:31:55.870 --> 01:32:01.010
but in factories, enterprises,

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:06.090
firms, exporters, Russian citizens

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.170
are primarily employed.

01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:11.630
And, accordingly, the growth of exports

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.790
means, first of all, the growth of their incomes.

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.910
And once they grow, the multiplier

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:20.370
effect is generally acting and the

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.850
entire Russian economy is

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.030
beginning to grow.

01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:27.670
The International Bank for Reconstruction

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.690
and Development, as well as various

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.010
World Trade Organization structures,

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.470
have considered the costs

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.910
of trade barriers to be

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.790
high enough.

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:41.410
For example, barricades

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:44.150
on imports of clothing to

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.550
the UK cause UK consumers

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.190
a loss of £500 million

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.030
annually.

01:32:53.370 --> 01:32:56.070
And this is because these barriers

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.870
are primarily related to imports

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.430
of textiles.

01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:07.410
On the other hand, Canadians are bound

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:10.130
by the same agreement, in the same

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.450
direction, for textile imports,

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:15.910
too, by certain barriers.

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.250
Canadians overpay for their

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.910
clothes due to textile

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.290
import barriers of

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.390
$780 million.

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:30.510
On the other hand, the European

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.430
Union, which liberalized barriers

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.370
within its integration group,

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.910
liberalized the telecommunications

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.790
sectors in the European

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.470
Union, resulting in prices

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.610
dropping by an average of

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.610
7-10% for telecommunications

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.930
services.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.910
Thus, even without calculations of

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.330
the winnings of Russian consumers

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.370
in the Russian market, there

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:01.830
are quite a large number of examples

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.750
of such exact statistical

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.030
calculations, which show how

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.030
much consumers lose or win

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.010
in the countries - members

01:34:10.890 --> 01:34:15.050
of the World Trade Organization

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.350
or in countries that have entered

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.750
the path of integration within

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.650
the framework of integration

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.210
unions.

01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:26.990
If you look at the general benefits

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.370
of joining the World Trade Organization

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.730
for a country, then according

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:35.650
to the postulates of both the theory

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:37.470
of international economy and

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.010
economic theory.

01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:40.510
If you remember, we have discussed

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.730
once in the section of state

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.790
regulation of foreign trade

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:45.370
the arguments for and against

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.790
tariffs.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:48.630
So these same arguments for and against

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.310
work in the direction that we can clearly

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.950
determine the direction of the benefits,

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.490
the common benefits of Russia'

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.570
s accession to the World Trade

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.390
Organization.

01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:03.530
First of all, this is an increase

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.430
in the country's income,

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.490
while increasing as the state

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:12.250
income, as the flow of goods and

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:19.530
taxes in this country is growing

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.470
and the state is receiving income

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.310
from the overall growth of

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.770
the economy and, accordingly,

01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:27.530
for example, collecting a tax on

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.870
profit or value added in a larger

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.290
amount, that is, the state is

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.830
still growing income, it will

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.210
not lose from the fact that it

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.650
will not collect some higher

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.870
foreign trade taxes.

01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:41.330
And, accordingly, personal income is

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.550
also growing, as I said, the owners

01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:45.470
of the factors of production

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:47.090
employed in the export industries,

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.890
they benefit from the expansion

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:51.310
of international trade.

01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:54.150
The next benefit is the

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.710
restructuring of the economy and

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.550
the growth of competitiveness, as

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.510
long as in this case there will

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.090
be a redistribution of production

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.690
factors in favor of more efficient

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.010
sectors of the economy

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.770
and redistribute in favor of

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.570
owners of production factors,

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.650
adequately, effectively

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.590
organizing their economic

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.470
process, their activities.

01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:23.510
The third factor is the growth

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.570
of employment, first of all, of course, it

01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:28.150
is the growth of employment in export

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.010
industries, but on the other hand, we and

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.830
you have already found out that the image

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.330
of a WTO member country is increasing, and

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.110
this increases the stability of the

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.890
image of this national economy, increases

01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:43.910
the expectation of transparency,

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.230
adequacy of foreign economic policy

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.930
of this country.

01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:52.810
Thus, the influx of investment

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:55.070
will increase and additional

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.370
jobs will be created on

01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:00.150
Russian territory.

01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:03.030
Of course, there is a

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.610
negative factor in

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.150
this case.

01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:09.890
If investments do not come to

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.470
the import substitution sector, then

01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:14.970
it is possible that this sector

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:18.710
or some subsectors of the import

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.910
substitution sector will not

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.250
withstand international

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.590
competition, and then

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.190
there will be a reduction

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.930
in employment and job cuts,

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.930
a fall in income.

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:37.930
Then it will be the time

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.790
for government intervention in these

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:40.810
problems.

01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:46.690
The problems of structural support

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:50.070
for the less protected industries

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.030
are the task of the state and

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.510
the task of preserving certain economic

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.350
and foreign trade barriers

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.550
for the transition period.

01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:03.210
The next factor of benefits is the increase

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:06.070
in the efficiency of foreign economic activity.

01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:09.150
In particular, it is assumed

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.750
that if a country moves

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.670
to develop such

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.690
foreign economic

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.230
legislation, even in the

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.410
process of preparation for

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.130
entry into the World Trade

01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:21.010
Organization, which

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.830
more or less meets

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.050
the standard requirements

01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:31.790
of the World Trade Organization,

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.930
then the work of

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.530
foreign trade various

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:37.650
controlling organizations,

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:39.650
including customs, becomes

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.910
more adequate, and so-

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.070
called transaction

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.970
costs or costs associated

01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:52.230
with corruption

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.170
are reduced.

01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:57.370
As far as transparent policy

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:00.410
implies that such a system

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.870
is developed in legislation that

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.210
does not force a double interpretation

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.250
of one or another position

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:11.090
of the law.

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:15.830
Moreover, such a transparent law

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.730
implies that decides how to

01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:26.510
act on some economic agent, our exporter,

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.410
not a official, it does not

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.690
depend on his subjective decision,

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.730
and laws to a certain extent

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.790
foreign trade have the principle

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.310
of automatic decision.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.550
Based on this, the demands

01:39:41.650 --> 01:39:45.690
of various large financial and

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.890
industrial groups or some other

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.570
structures that try to

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.550
lobby for the protection

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.770
of their group interests

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.570
are reduced.

01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:57.110
An example of lobbying in

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.750
the Russian market is, of course,

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.870
our automotive industry and agricultural

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.890
producers, as well

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:05.530
as the financial sector of

01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.590
the economy.

01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:10.690
In this regard, corruption problems

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.630
are closely linked to lobbying,

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.530
since the framework between

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:20.390
lobbying and demanding

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.710
such a quota rent is

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.970
often blurred.

01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:30.270
Quota rent in this case, I mean

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.690
that when officials distribute

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.810
quotas, it is possible that

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:42.310
they are demanding their payment

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.510
for making such a decision.

01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:48.310
If the foreign trade law becomes

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.970
more transparent and the mechanism

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.750
of its operation becomes more

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.330
automatic, then, of course, the possibility

01:40:57.150 --> 01:40:59.470
of receiving such quota rent

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.110
decreases.

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:05.290
The next benefit for the economy

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.410
of the country as a whole

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.250
is safety and standardization

01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.210
of products.

01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:14.310
Of course, I have already said

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.670
that often on some kind of

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.250
products standards of Russia

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.490
are quite high, but on the

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:23.510
other hand, we can make a whole

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.850
list, a whole list of some other

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.090
types of products, standards

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:29.710
on which not enough.

01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:31.810
Again, we should not go far

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:33.950
to follow the example.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.710
Take the emission standards

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.390
of our automobile

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.190
production, cars, some

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.930
trucks, the entire fleet.

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.870
In Europe, the standard is already in effect

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.870
beyond the euro -3, and, accordingly, the

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.510
Russian, so to speak, the euro - 4 has already

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:54.450
been adopted, and Russian cars are

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:57.630
currently made under the old type of standard.

01:41:57.670 --> 01:41:59.410
Accordingly, many cities

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.510
experience such external or rebellious

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.370
effects from the activities of the

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:07.970
Russian automotive industry, and

01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.070
accordingly, this is a national

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.530
problem such as ecology, it can

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.910
somehow move towards its solutions

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.730
precisely because of the fact

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.310
that Russia will join the

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.290
WTO and, accordingly, will

01:42:20.610 --> 01:42:22.290
enjoy certain security standards

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.270
that are adopted in the

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.230
entire civilized world.

01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:32.170
Another important overall benefit

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:35.750
of Russia's accession to the WTO

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.090
is a more stable political environment.

01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:43.110
After all, if conflicts related to

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.810
the flow of goods and services

01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:48.170
are resolved within the WTO mechanism,

01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:50.810
then, again, these problems

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:53.530
do not accumulate, some positions

01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:58.790
do not heat up, and the possibility

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.450
of a resolution, a peaceful

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.690
resolution leads to the fact

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:04.110
that the political situation

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.150
between countries

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.830
becomes more stable.

01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:12.290
Of course, such a conclusion or such a

01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.350
consequence is not necessary.

01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.730
Why is?

01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:16.610
Because I said before, when you and

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:20.010
I discussed the introduction

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.110
of economic sanctions, that,

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.630
for example, economic sanctions

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.090
are often the result of political

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.310
struggle.

01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:30.990
And they themselves do not

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.170
reflect any trade disputes.

01:43:33.690 --> 01:43:36.910
They are most likely just a tool

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.550
in the hands of politicians

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.070
to punish one side or the other.

01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:45.490
But, nevertheless, if we do not take

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.090
the options of introducing an embargo

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:51.250
or such restrictions, then, in

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:53.410
general, if there is a mechanism

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.490
for coordinating common decisions

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.490
within the WTO, then

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.390
the political situation without

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.610
any major economic problems becomes

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:04.810
more transparent and more

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.890
stable, without major crisis

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.830
situations.

01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:13.470
The overall benefits of Russia's accession

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.790
to the World Trade Organization are

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.830
not only related to Russia itself.

01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:20.070
Per that's why WTO

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.710
members agree to translate

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.490
negotiations.

01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:28.650
Because if these countries were

01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:31.130
not interested in Russia's accession

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.370
to the WTO, then they probably

01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:36.410
countered it in every way.

01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:38.970
Therefore, the other side of the countries

01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:40.970
and members are also interested

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.650
in getting access to a sufficiently

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.710
large Russian market.

01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:48.730
Therefore, the relationship between

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.030
countries is settled by

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.210
ensuring, first of all, equal chances

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.830
for all participants, members,

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:58.710
including small countries,

01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.070
which, probably, if they were to

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.590
speak separately in negotiations

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.790
with such a giant as Russia,,

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.210
would often have less chances

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:11.230
for defending their interests.

01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:14.890
The overall benefit, again, is an

01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:16.390
effective dispute resolution

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.630
mechanism.

01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:19.850
Failure to take unilateral

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.970
action, which usually leads to a banal

01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.970
trade, and when both sides

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.390
start to impose counter-tariffs,

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.110
quotas and restrictions, and ultimately

01:45:31.190 --> 01:45:33.190
suffer both the producer and

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.590
the consumer, and the countries

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.170
that have begun, so to speak,

01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:40.870
this trade ban, and that country

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.530
that is taking only

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.510
retaliatory measures.

01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:47.650
The next benefit, of course,

01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:49.430
normal development, stable development

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.590
of economic relations will reduce

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.770
the risks, for example, trade, international

01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:59.450
trade crises, international financial

01:45:59.590 --> 01:46:00.990
crisis, and, in the end,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.230
all this strengthens international

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.050
stability and pushes

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:08.670
away the possibility

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.970
of such an abnormal

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.610
situation as the world economic

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:15.270
crisis.

01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:19.010
Lastly, we will emphasize once again

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:22.070
that in this case, the risk of political

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.870
conflicts is reduced for all countries.

01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:28.190
What is the history of negotiations

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.170
on Russia's accession to the

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:33.190
World Trade Organization?

01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:38.070
In 1993, Russia filed an application

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.630
for accession to the

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:41.930
then-General Agreement

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.430
on Tariffs and Trade.

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:46.910
And then, by the decision of the

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.390
GAD, a working group on accession was created.

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:51.970
And the first thing that this working

01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:54.270
group did was to study the Russian

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:57.310
trade regime and to develop

01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:00.390
those questions, problems, these

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.210
requirements that Russia had

01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:04.930
to fulfill in the framework

01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.010
of adjusting its

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:08.710
foreign trade regulation legislation.

01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:11.690
But the 93th year is still a rather

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.170
difficult year in the development

01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:16.050
of Russia itself, so there was

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:19.890
no real negotiation process in the

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:22.170
first stages until the 95th

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.130
year of the reval negotiation.

01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:25.930
Here were only some conditions

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.650
for further solutions.

01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:31.970
As I said before, since Russia primarily

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.810
trade with the European Union, it was

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:37.870
the representatives of the European

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:40.970
Union that were entrusted with the

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.530
preparation of these very requirements

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:47.210
and conditions for Russia's accession

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.910
to the ETO.

01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:54.630
In 1998, the initial proposals

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.950
on access to the market of goods

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.010
and services and on the level of

01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.490
support for agriculture from

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:12.530
Russia and member countries

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.010
began.

01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:18.330
And these initial proposals,

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.170
again, were adjusted

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:22.090
for a long time, almost

01:48:22.330 --> 01:48:24.450
for two years.

01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:26.890
And, in fact, only from the beginning

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.610
of the new millennium in 2000 began

01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:32.310
to be discussed all aspects of the

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.490
process of accession of Russia to

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:35.830
the World Trade Organization,

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.150
and not only the problems related to

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.150
the agreement between GAD and GAC.

01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:46.270
What is the state of the modern

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.510
working group, which conducts, analyzes,

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.170
makes decisions, analyzes the

01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:53.490
problems related to the accession

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.850
of Russia to the ETO?

01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:59.010
First of all, according to the requirements

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:00.750
of the ETO, the standard requirements

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:03.430
for all potential members of the ETO,

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.950
this group includes, of course, not all

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.850
150 countries, representatives of

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:11.990
not all 150 countries of the

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.270
world, namely those countries

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.410
that maintain the closest foreign

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:19.290
trade relations with a potential member,

01:49:20.170 --> 01:49:23.070
and precisely those countries that,

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.830
so to speak, have some

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.130
unsatisfied issues in conducting

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:32.310
this very foreign trade.

01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:47.610
And so until the end of 2006 in such

01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:50.590
blocs was considered as one

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:51.850
country.

01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:54.450
Therefore, 58 countries are a large

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.150
group of countries, which include

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.830
not only developed countries but also

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:00.030
developing countries, which are

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.110
interested in the Russian market or

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.950
in the import of products,

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.490
Russian products or from

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.450
Russian territory.

01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:13.010
In early 2007, Vietnam

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.670
and Cambodia joined

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.970
the negotiations.

01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:19.290
What could this be related to?

01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:21.950
First, Vietnam and Cambodia

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:24.810
are large agricultural

01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:27.110
producers.

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:28.970
On the other hand, Vietnam has

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:32.510
recently tried to intercept the world

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:36.070
factory squad from China.

01:50:36.130 --> 01:50:37.950
That is, on the territory of Vietnam

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.310
is organized

01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:41.970
export-oriented production,

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:45.170
quite cheap products related

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:48.630
to clothing, with the assembly

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.770
of some final consumption goods.

01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:55.870
They joined the negotiation process

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:58.090
in 2007 because the issues

01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.950
of barriers to agricultural

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:03.230
products are being

01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:05.750
resolved right now.

01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:08.110
The number of working

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.470
groups that are working

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.030
on Russia's accession

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:16.010
to the WTO is now

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.130
500.

01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:23.810
It is 50 member countries.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.410
These are the countries that

01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:28.670
are primarily interested

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.570
in regulating trade.

01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:33.650
In terms of access to

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:36.370
the Russian market, the group

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:38.270
has about 30 members.

01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:44.250
If we summarize the situation

01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:47.250
of the negotiation process

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:50.110
now, we can highlight the

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:52.710
following elements of this

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.710
negotiation process, which

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.890
took place in 2007.

01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:00.930
First of all, the level of binding

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:04.030
of the rates of roaming duties

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.870
on Russian territory is currently determined.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.490
What is the level of connection?

01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:11.910
That is, the maximum interest rate

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:15.390
for different product groups

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.990
is determined, which will be

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.810
retained after Russia joins all

01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:31.230
members of the working group.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:34.110
They agreed that the initial level

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.670
of bonding of customs duties

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:39.650
would not be lower than the current level.

01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:42.290
In the first year,

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:44.030
no tariffs will be

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.030
reduced.

01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.870
The level of customs protection

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.090
of agriculture will not decrease, and

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:54.030
in a number of positions Russia

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.430
even has the right to raise the

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.810
rates of customs duties a bit in

01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.470
this very transitional period

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.750
until 2009.

01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:08.770
In 2009, the right to use tariff

01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.170
quotas for three types of meat was

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:14.370
recorded - beef, pork and poultry

01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:15.570
meat.

01:53:16.210 --> 01:53:20.590
The technology for determining these

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.310
quotas is the current level of

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:28.390
quotas plus 2.5 percent expansion of

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.550
quotas depending on the annual

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:36.330
growth of the supply of meat production

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:39.190
on Russian territory.

01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:45.230
You know that 2006-2007 was marked by quite

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:48.010
thunderstorm disputes between the European

01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:50.750
Union and, in particular, Poland

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:52.950
over the embargo on meat imports

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.690
from the territory of the European Union.

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:59.030
Not only from the territory of Poland,

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.910
but a number of countries are included

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.950
in this list.

01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:06.350
It is in connection with the fact that, in

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.890
the opinion of the Russian country,

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.570
certain technical, so to speak, medical

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.090
requirements and standards have been violated.

01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:18.870
In the future, as you can see, Russia

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.010
has at least at this stage of negotiations

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.930
obtained the right to maintain

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:25.430
such protectionist

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:28.090
measures with regard to meat

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:31.090
imports.

01:54:33.190 --> 01:54:36.210
In general, for example, the second

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.650
significant direction of negotiations,

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.510
negotiations on agricultural

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.870
issues, came to the fact that Russia'

01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:47.890
s position has not yet been recognized,

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:51.750
it is not agreed on the part of

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:56.390
the party to accept the proposal

01:54:56.410 --> 01:54:58.690
that Russia made for negotiations.

01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:02.270
Russia proposes to fix the amount

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.130
of support for our agriculture

01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:07.050
in the reserve period

01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:12.870
1993-1995.

01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:18.430
The amount of support will

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:22.050
be $9.5 billion a year, but,

01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:26.990
it would seem, such a not so

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.870
large amount compared to

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.950
the EU's investments in

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.850
its agriculture has not yet

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.490
been perceived by the negotiating

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:40.970
parties as a normal level

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.670
of protectionist protection

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.090
in the form of state

01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:48.270
subsidies for agriculture,

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.770
export or national economy.

01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:57.030
The allowed amount of domestic state

01:55:57.230 --> 01:56:00.070
support of the agricultural sector,

01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:02.750
of course, does not apply to all

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.350
types of agricultural products,

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.370
but only a certain list, the so-

01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:09.190
called yellow basket.

01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:17.490
This list includes the product

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.770
demanding a reduction

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.730
in protectionism.

01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.640
The next, third block is

01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:31.500
the access to the service market.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.260
This is primarily financial

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:38.200
services and energy

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.700
services.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.100
And in this regard, of course,

01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:48.280
the struggle is due to the fact

01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:51.580
that restricting access to the service

01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:56.100
market is lobbied by our financial groups,

01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.140
and they prove that access to the

01:56:59.150 --> 01:57:00.920
financial market, which is not

01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.120
yet so sustainable, they think

01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.980
should be limited.

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:06.480
Consequently, in the process of

01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:10.860
negotiations these problems are raised.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.740
The next sector is not only

01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:15.860
financial, but also energy.

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.740
And here India advocates for access

01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:22.040
to individuals.

01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:23.600
India, Canada and Switzerland

01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:26.580
are advocating for individuals' access

01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:30.840
to the Russian market in

01:57:30.850 --> 01:57:34.540
certain sectors of financial services.

01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:38.160
In principle, the negotiators concluded

01:57:38.170 --> 01:57:41.440
that Russia agreed to open

01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:45.220
115 services sectors out of

01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:49.120
the 150 sectors listed by

01:57:49.130 --> 01:57:52.980
the World Trade Organization.

01:57:53.220 --> 01:58:01.580
The proposal also stipulates the

01:58:01.590 --> 01:58:03.600
stricter conditions for foreign

01:58:03.610 --> 01:58:08.220
service providers on the Russian market.

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:12.260
And the next block, the last block,

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:15.360
concerning the negotiation process

01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:17.780
is negotiations on systemic issues.

01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:19.320
This is primarily

01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:21.020
the Russian law.

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:25.420
Three blocks of questions are raised.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.280
The first is the non-compliance

01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:28.880
of Russian legislation with the

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.920
WTO requirement in the field

01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:34.220
of sanitary and phytosanitary

01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:35.720
measures.

01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.840
Basically, we have raised these questions

01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:39.760
with you already.

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.060
And this includes not only various

01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.200
tariff quotas for meat, but also,

01:58:44.210 --> 01:58:46.960
as the WTO working group believes,

01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:49.380
excessive requirements for alcohol

01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:51.360
and pharmaceuticals.

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.440
As you can see, the

01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:56.700
country that is interested

01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:58.580
here is India.

01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:04.920
The next direction is the

01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.000
use of some elements of state

01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:10.040
regulation in the sphere

01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:11.660
of foreign economic

01:59:11.670 --> 01:59:13.940
activity, which, again, do

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:15.580
not meet the requirements

01:59:15.590 --> 01:59:17.280
and standards of the

01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:19.480
World Trade Organization.

01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.940
The last block – requirements on systemic

01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:24.880
issues, changes in the legal

01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:26.300
system of Russia, are called

01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:28.200
the WTO+.

01:59:28.210 --> 01:59:30.360
In principle, of course, Russia may

01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:31.700
not pay attention to them because

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:34.520
they are not within the jurisdiction

01:59:34.530 --> 01:59:38.100
of the World Trade Organization.

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:40.240
They are related to government procurement

01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:42.940
of civil aviation equipment.

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.000
However, in order to eliminate possible

01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:48.740
conflicts and subsequent problems

01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:50.860
with the situation in trade flows,

01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:55.080
these negotiations also take place.

01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:58.360
What other requirements do WTO member

01:59:58.370 --> 02:00:00.320
countries make to Russia in the

02:00:00.330 --> 02:00:02.820
framework of mutual agreements?

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:05.380
This is the abolition of the

02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:07.580
national components of investment projects.

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:11.480
For now, it was assumed that when

02:00:11.490 --> 02:00:15.040
direct investments are made in the

02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:23.620
Russian market, the national

02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:25.800
component should also be

02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:28.920
included in the investment process.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.300
The next requirement is to ensure

02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:33.860
compliance with the requirements

02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:35.540
of the WTO, the applicable tariff

02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:37.340
quotas.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.020
This applies to agricultural

02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:41.160
agreements.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:44.620
This requirement involves

02:00:44.630 --> 02:00:45.960
such agreements that

02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:47.620
reduce their use.

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:52.000
The next requirement is the

02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:53.940
organization of the transactions

02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:55.220
of sale by state trade

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:59.660
enterprises on a commercial basis.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.460
The most important requirement is not to

02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:06.140
discriminate against foreign companies in participating

02:01:06.150 --> 02:01:08.560
in these transactions.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.820
This component is due to the fact

02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:14.680
that in developed countries

02:01:14.690 --> 02:01:18.480
the state distributes

02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:22.680
state orders among domestic producers.

02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:25.900
But within these crossings, it

02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:28.080
is expected that a consensus

02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:31.120
will be developed that will allow

02:01:31.130 --> 02:01:34.240
foreign companies to participate

02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:36.760
in purchasing programs to

02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:39.420
a greater extent.

02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:42.180
The last essential requirement

02:01:42.190 --> 02:01:43.720
put forward by the

02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:46.000
WTO members is the question

02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:47.780
of dual education on

02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:49.440
energy goods.

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:51.580
This question is quite complex.

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:55.160
Here, Russia has developed a

02:01:55.170 --> 02:01:58.120
tough position, showing that

02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:01.180
we, with our energy goods,

02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:04.420
energy donors in certain volumes,

02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:06.800
at certain stable

02:02:06.810 --> 02:02:08.320
prices, must provide

02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:11.560
national demand of national

02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:13.700
producers.

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:17.280
Now we will consider the last question

02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:20.420
of our lecture, concerning

02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:23.360
the readiness of the Russian

02:02:23.370 --> 02:02:24.820
market of Russian producers

02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:25.840
to join the WTO.

02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:29.180
On the one hand, Russian producers

02:02:29.190 --> 02:02:31.560
were protected from foreign flow of

02:02:31.570 --> 02:02:35.380
goods and services at the expense

02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:38.500
of the currency component almost

02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:42.920
in the period after the 1998 crisis.

02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.220
We have been aware of the situation

02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:47.620
in international economic relations

02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:50.360
where the exchange rate

02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:51.900
can act as a protectionist

02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:53.500
barrier.

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.760
If the ruble is weak enough,

02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:58.260
it means that you can buy a

02:02:58.270 --> 02:03:01.400
smaller amount of dollars

02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:03.480
or euros for this ruble and,

02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:07.080
accordingly, a smaller

02:03:07.090 --> 02:03:10.620
amount of goods for imports.

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:16.920
By 2001, this currency protectionism

02:03:16.930 --> 02:03:20.680
was exhausted.

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.940
Based on this, starting in 2001,

02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:25.420
pay attention to the scheme, in general,

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.180
the Russian manufacturer

02:03:30.190 --> 02:03:32.100
has already been in a situation

02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:33.940
of normal competitiveness,

02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:37.560
and the competition

02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:39.440
of imports from far abroad

02:03:39.450 --> 02:03:41.860
in this case has increased.

02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:43.380
This is not a new revelation

02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:45.840
for the Russian manufacturers.

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:50.580
The Russian ruble is still

02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:52.700
stable and has a certain

02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:56.360
growth rate.

02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.820
But here everything depends on

02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:00.980
the central bank's monetary policy,

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.880
to what extent it will be acceptable

02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:07.120
for the Russian economy to deliberately

02:04:07.130 --> 02:04:09.820
intervene to reduce the currency

02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:12.080
rate of the ruble.

02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:14.740
Such an automatic mechanism, which

02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:19.560
was associated with the weak

02:04:19.570 --> 02:04:21.000
national Russian currency ruble,

02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:24.820
is in this case already exhausted.

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.900
And for the past 5-6 years, Russian

02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:31.700
manufacturers have been forced

02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:33.680
to take this into account.

02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:39.480
Pay attention to Russia's import

02:04:39.490 --> 02:04:47.040
tariffs and the strange members

02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:49.740
of the conciliation group

02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:53.140
demanding the removal of

02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:55.040
some protectionist restrictions

02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:56.200
on agriculture.

02:04:56.900 --> 02:05:00.540
Our tariffs are quite comparable

02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:03.420
to the restrictions currently in force

02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:05.560
in the territory of developed

02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:07.520
and developing countries.

02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:10.700
In developing countries,

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:13.600
tariffs on agricultural

02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:15.300
imports reach

02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.440
almost 19%.

02:05:19.450 --> 02:05:23.260
In a large export and import economy

02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:24.960
like China, this is even

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.940
40%.

02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:29.880
In countries with transitional economies,

02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:34.240
this percentage is quite high and

02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:36.920
reaches about 16%.

02:05:36.930 --> 02:05:40.420
In developed countries, the national

02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:42.960
agricultural market

02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:43.680
protection

02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:45.600
is sufficiently strong.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:47.420
As you know, this is the main

02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:48.980
problem in the negotiations between

02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:50.900
the EU and the United States, in the

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.320
negotiations between the EU and

02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:54.580
developing countries.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:57.560
The EU has raised the protectionist

02:05:57.570 --> 02:06:00.320
protection in agriculture

02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:02.760
to 43.4%.

02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:05.320


02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:09.640
There is a prohibitive level

02:06:09.650 --> 02:06:12.180
of tariffs.

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:15.360
And based on these figures, we

02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:17.300
can say that our domestic agriculture

02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:19.060
and agricultural producers

02:06:19.070 --> 02:06:20.780
already operate within the framework

02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:23.100
of a sufficiently liberalized

02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:24.940
market for agricultural

02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:26.560
products.

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:28.900
Therefore, accession to

02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:30.540
the WTO whileining this

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:32.980
level of protection for a transitional

02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:34.740
period, or even a decrease

02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:37.020
at a certain stage of this

02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:40.380
level, will not lead to

02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:42.000
some unexpected results

02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:44.160
for agricultural producers.

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:46.540
Pay attention to the slide,

02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.540
which illustrates the actual level

02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:52.100
of import, import tariff.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:55.780
If we consider that the so-called

02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:58.460
weighted average rate of the import

02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:59.960
tariff is usually calculated in

02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:01.760
international debates and calculations,

02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:04.740
then by 2000, gradually decreasing,

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.540
it reached an average of 2.5% in

02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:08.820
our country.

02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:11.100
Of course, this average is quite

02:07:11.110 --> 02:07:14.360
conditional, because it is calculated

02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:16.300
as a kind of average temperature

02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:17.940
for the hospital.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.700
That is, one has a limit temperature,

02:07:20.710 --> 02:07:22.880
and the other, unfortunately,

02:07:22.890 --> 02:07:25.160
already. So, the weighted

02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:27.360
average rate is, I repeat,

02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:29.080
now already by 2000,

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:31.580
and now is still slightly

02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:34.360
below 12.5%.

02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:36.420
But an effective rate of the

02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:38.640
import tariff implies that we also

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.800
take into account the flows associated

02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:46.800
with the shadow economy and other

02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:53.740
negative protection of the

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:55.720
existing tariff.

02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:58.260
In this case, the effective

02:07:58.270 --> 02:08:00.300
rate of the import

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:02.520
tariff is only about

02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:04.640
9%.

02:08:04.650 --> 02:08:08.060
Thus, the Russian market, I repeat,

02:08:08.070 --> 02:08:10.560
has already used to working

02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:13.300
in fairly tough conditions

02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:15.980
of competitive struggle with imports.

02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:20.300
The Russian proposals on the part

02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:21.540
of the Russian delegation

02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:25.500
to the negotiations include expanding

02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:29.280
the corridor of protectionist rates

02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:31.120
and fixing the initial and

02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:33.700
final level of the related tariff

02:08:33.710 --> 02:08:35.220
bond, i.e. the upper and lower

02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:37.320
limit of the tariff,

02:08:37.330 --> 02:08:40.300
on industrial goods at the level

02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:47.020
of 14.3% to 9.8%, against

02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:52.760
the real level of 9.7% of the

02:08:52.770 --> 02:08:55.480
average tariff.

02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.820
What are the real factors

02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:02.260
of open economy?

02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:06.060
Of course, these are factors that are

02:09:06.070 --> 02:09:08.960
contrary to the normal operation of economic

02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:12.420
policy, which is developed and

02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:14.800
in accordance with our legislation.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:20.220
First, on the one hand, these are

02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:22.900
such negative factors as the

02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:26.020
existence of gray schemes, when

02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:28.960
goods produced and designed

02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:30.960
for lower income of the population,

02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:32.360
oriented to some third

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.780
of developing countries, fall

02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:35.780
on the Russian market and,

02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:37.000
accordingly, they

02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:39.240
are in relation to our goods

02:09:39.250 --> 02:09:41.160
in essence sold and offered

02:09:41.170 --> 02:09:45.160
under dumping schemes.

02:09:45.170 --> 02:09:47.480
On the other hand, importers have

02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:50.480
serious schemes of tax optimization,

02:09:50.490 --> 02:09:52.840
which also lowers the price

02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:56.360
level of imported goods.

02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:59.280
The last negative component is the

02:09:59.290 --> 02:10:02.920
boat imports, which have recently

02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:04.100
been somewhat reduced, as

02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:07.060
such competition in the Russian

02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:09.600
market, the growth of Russian population's

02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:13.620
income and the increase of the bar

02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:17.620
of requirements for product quality

02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:19.660
leads to the fact that gradually

02:10:19.670 --> 02:10:21.420
boat imports are collapsing

02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:23.700
and becoming more organized

02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:25.840
at the level of small and

02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:28.200
medium-sized importers.

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.760
The next factor, which is no longer related

02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:32.400
to the shadow economy and, in principle,

02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:34.880
is subject to possible regulation

02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:36.080
by the government in the

02:10:36.090 --> 02:10:38.040
person of the Central Bank, is the

02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.300
rise of the ruble.

02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.400
As I said, a stronger and more stable

02:10:43.410 --> 02:10:45.540
ruble, but with a tendency

02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:47.720
to rise, usually restricts

02:10:47.730 --> 02:10:50.500
exports and increases imports.

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.920
This factor has been working

02:10:54.930 --> 02:10:57.720
for a year, at least since 2002,

02:10:57.730 --> 02:11:01.300
and, accordingly, Russian manufacturers

02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:03.320
should have become

02:11:03.330 --> 02:11:08.620
accustomed to this factor too.

02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:12.080
In the case of gray imports, I would like

02:11:12.090 --> 02:11:14.540
to draw your attention to the fact that,

02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:19.440
according to the calculations of independent

02:11:19.450 --> 02:11:23.400
organizations, for the six months

02:11:23.410 --> 02:11:25.300
of 2006, gray imports amounted

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:27.760
to a fairly serious amount,

02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:33.300
which reached $18 billion.

02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.440
However, this type of imports

02:11:40.450 --> 02:11:45.360
may decrease.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:52.540
Because, if in 2005, gray imports

02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:54.340
worked, the development of modern

02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:56.520
legislation and adaptation to

02:11:56.530 --> 02:11:58.280
the WTO rules leads to the

02:11:58.290 --> 02:11:59.840
fact that gray imports are slightly

02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:05.420
reduced from 47% to 32%.

02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:07.920
True, the Central Bank gives lower figures,

02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:10.600
in fact, twice the case, but in this

02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:13.760
case we will consider that the

02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:15.700
truth is somewhere in the

02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:17.900
middle between the expert assessment

02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:20.480
of specialists and the calculations

02:12:20.490 --> 02:12:22.580
of the Central Bank.

02:12:22.590 --> 02:12:24.760
The last thing I would like to

02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:27.580
draw your attention to is that,

02:12:27.590 --> 02:12:30.640
based on the previous slide scheme,

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:33.040
we have in general already in the

02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:36.540
Russian economy for a number

02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:39.360
of years developed a fairly low

02:12:39.370 --> 02:12:41.580
level of average tariff, which

02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:52.520
covers the current and important

02:12:52.530 --> 02:12:55.540
problems related to Russia's

02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:57.520
entry into the WTO.
