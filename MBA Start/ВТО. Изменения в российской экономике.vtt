WEBVTT

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.540
Good day.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.260
My name is Natalya Ivanovna Dmitrieva.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.400
The World Trade Organization

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.500
changes the Russian

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.320
economy.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.360
In the course of international

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.720
economic relations we considered

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.340
with you that one of the forms

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.960
of international economic relations

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.260
is interstate

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.080
regulation of foreign

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.740
trade relations.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.140
The organizations involved in this process

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.720
are, first of all, the International

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.060
Monetary Fund, the World Bank,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.040
the Bank for International Settlements.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.540
The World Trade Organization is one

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.100
of the international organizations

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.100
that regulates foreign economic

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.500
relations within the framework

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.480
of the activities of about 150 countries.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.000
The World Trade Organization

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.740
(WTO) is the first organization

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.560
that regulates trade relations.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.000
The history of the establishment

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.960
of the World Trade Organization.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.240
In the postwar period of 47 years,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.220
as we already know, the countries

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.380
of Europe were moving to remove

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.020
barriers, because in the postwar

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.500
period the barriers were so

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.460
high that they were essentially prohibitive.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.080
The assistance of the United States of America

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.560
under the Marshal Plan envisaged the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840
fulfillment by all countries of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.280
the future European Union of the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.300
conditions of liberalization

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.060
of foreign trade relations.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.520
Therefore, negotiations within

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.280
the ministries of countries that would

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.700
like to liberalize their

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.580
international relations began almost

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.980
immediately in the post-war period.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.320
We talked for a long time,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.700
as you and I know, there

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.880
were a lot of rounds.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.900
Each round lasted for more than

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.740
a year, but the General

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.520
Trade Tariff Agreement

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.500
was eventually signed.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.020
The agreements that were reached

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.220
and signed within the framework of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.180
the GATT then formed the basis

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.620
for the next stage of development

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.880
of international regulation of

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.740
foreign trade, namely the creation

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.700
of the World Trade Organization.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.680
On January 1, 1995, the GATT

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.480
was transformed into the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.520
World Trade Organization.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.020
In this case, as far as the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.600
Uruguayan documents signed as

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.540
part of the Uruguayan Round, as

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.700
you can see on the slide that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.600
took place from 1986 until 1994,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.280
they were the basis of the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.560
World Trade Organization.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.980
At present, the WTO membership is

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.200
already 150 countries, which shows

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.760
the interest of all the countries in

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.060
the world, which maintain active

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.140
foreign trade relations, to be included

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.400
in the negotiation processes

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.080
and interest in participation

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.320
in the World Trade Organization.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.380
Most of the WTO member

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.120
countries were members of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.760
the General Trade Tariff

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.940
Agreement, but a certain

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.920
number of countries joined

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.800
it quite late.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.520
And if you look at the next

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.100
slide, see, for example, Moldova

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.760
joined the World Trade Organization

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.980
in 2001, and a country

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.260
like Saudi Arabia even

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.520
in 2005.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.040
In this case, the processes

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.720
in recent years have become more

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.480
complex for many countries.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.880
Why is?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.740
Because, as you have seen from the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.460
history of the development of

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.800
the World Trade Organization, negotiation

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.720
processes have been going almost since

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.340
1947.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.440
And of course, the major

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.700
WTO members who were

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.780
on the year-on-year deal made

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.740
it easier for them to enter

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.800
into their mutual agreements

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.060
precisely because they had

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.780
been negotiating for almost

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.040
decades.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.700
On this basis, a paradoxical

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.300
situation arises.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.100
Of course, new countries would

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.480
like to join the World Trade

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.240
Organization, but the WTO, as

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.640
some integration association,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.220
now looks very closely

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.160
at those members who claim

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.060
to join the World Trade

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.360
Organization and try to get

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.760
certain preferences from

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.820
new members in a more

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.380
rigid manner.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.680
The old members, when they joined

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.320
the WTO, were assumed to have reached

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.940
a certain level of tariff changes

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.660
and arrangements, and the

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.560
requirement to the old members

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.020
was to some extent even

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.760
less stringent.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.280
But nevertheless, such a careful attention

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.700
is understandable, there are

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.100
economic and political interests

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.840
in the participating countries, and they

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.100
are trying to get all possible preferences

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.160
from the emergence of a new country

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.200
as a member of the World

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.580
Trade Organization.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.160
The WTO is the permanent form

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.960
of membership.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.960
This is due to the fact

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.760
that the negotiation processes,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.640
WTO rounds are virtually not stopped,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.820
and as we will then look at the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.220
structure of the WTO, a permanent

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.360
annual summit is provided within

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.680
the framework of the World

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.160
Trade Organization to sign

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.980
or agree on some future agreements.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.860
In principle, eight rounds of

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.160
international trade negotiations

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.760
have been held since

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.440
1991, and the last round, which

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.380
is still in effect, is called

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.000
the Millennium Round or

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.000
Pre-Round, which, in general,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.520
began in 2000.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.160
The goal of the Dohrund

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.440
is to liberalize trade

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.960
in agricultural products.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.840
In general, this is the most painful

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.160
problem associated with the activities

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.380
of the members of the World

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.680
Trade Organization.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.120
Until now, most of the WTO

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.460
member countries have supported

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.340
certain protectionist

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.960
measures to protect national

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.320
agricultural producers,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.480
believing that their

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.140
production conditions are

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.860
so, so to say, difficult that

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.560
the state is obliged

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.080
to support them and

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.740
stimulate the development

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.120
of domestic agricultural

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.080
production.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.160
A study conducted by the World

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.300
Bank in the late 1990s on the

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.300
liberalization model, so

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.400
to speak, showed that if possible,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.060
of course, there are three

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.820
variants.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.720
The first option is such a general

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.420
and complete liberalization

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.540
of international economic relations.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.000
The second option is an intermediate

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.220
option, when, so to speak,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.040
liberalization will reach some

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.560
such average level.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.460
So, under the forecast

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.760
of specialists, if the

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.940
pig farm barriers are removed,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.580
then the developing countries,

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.540
including new market economies,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.900
I mean Russia, are the

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.900
winners.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.280
From this, it is clear what

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.760
serious interests are facing

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.500
within the problems

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.980
of pig liberalization.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.000
These are European

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.820
producers, as the European

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.620
Union is known to spend

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.820
50% of its EU budget

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:35.740
on supporting

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.660
its pig farmers.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.740
At the same time, the United States, walking

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.760
and accusing Europe of direct protectionism

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.260
in supporting its

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.260
agricultural experience.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.020
Nevertheless, the United States also

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.600
in the late 1990s carried out an intra-

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.440
national program for modernizing

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.740
agriculture, to stimulate

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.480
the intensification of production.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.280
And accordingly, within this program

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.920
there were also options for financial

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.960
support of the organization.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.800
The main goal of the agreement

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.600
is to further liberalize

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.960
world trade and ensure

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.260
fair competition.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.160
As we discussed with you in the course

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.800
of international economic relations,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.900
the principle that the second best

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.960
is not given, namely, better than

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.640
liberal economic relations, which

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.720
involve the rapid development

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.900
of export relations, has not

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.940
yet been invented by mankind.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.360
Another thing is that at some stage

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.780
of its development, each country

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.860
defends its national interests,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.360
considers the situation that

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.580
develops in the national

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.640
economy, and within the economic

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.300
cycle, if there is a situation

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.260
of recession, crisis or

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.460
some threat, in particular

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.940
to agriculture, then it

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.120
tries to protect its national

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.680
producers.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.840
Therefore, the national interests

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.980
of some individual countries may

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.040
go against the interests of

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.960
the world community, which is

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.980
interested in the general liberalization

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.140
of international trade,

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.980
as such will lead to a more rational

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.660
redistribution of

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.640
resources in the world, their

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.360
effective use, and, consequently,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.960
will lead to the growth

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.720
of the world gross product.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.060
What are the specific goals of the

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.300
World Trade Organization?

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.460
First of all, they aim to

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.920
support existing agreements,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.340
track them, and, so to

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.500
speak, live.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.760
Namely, the agreements on trade in

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.860
services and agreements that have

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.480
been signed in the last decade,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.880
almost the decade of

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.400
the twentieth century.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.260
This is practically an agreement

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.720
within the WTO, not within,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.320
so to speak, the GAD.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.440
This is the TRIMS agreement, which bears the name.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.840
This is the agreement on trade

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.500
aspects of the transfer of intellectual

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.440
property rights and the TRIMS

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.340
agreement, that is, an

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.880
agreement between countries

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.120
on trade aspects of investment

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.540
measures.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.000
Of course, the current goal,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.080
as I said, within the Doharound

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.360
is to create a new agreement

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.680
on retail products.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.400
What are the basic principles of GAD?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.240
First of all, it is assumed that

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.540
it is within this agreement that

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.740
the regime of the greatest favor

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.720
works most adequately.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.660
What is his main idea?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.020
It is assumed that the member countries, when

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.800
arranging foreign trade relations,

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.220
are oriented to the fact that the conditions

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.240
of trade between the countries

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.280
will be no worse than the conditions

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.760
between other member countries.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.440
Thus, it is assumed that the countries will

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.300
not increase the tariffs that have already

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.440
been introduced between the other member countries.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.240
That is, in essence, it is

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.180
an agreement on a certain level

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.140
of protectionist protection.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.220
The next principle of the General

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.900
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs is

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.600
the mutual granting of national

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.900
treatment.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.520
What is meant here?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.480
In this case, the main purpose

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.840
of this agreement is to create a

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.640
situation in which the importer

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:30.700
would have on its own producers,

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.280
that is, it would be granted

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.620
the same rights as its producers,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.760
which would increase competition

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.640
for national producers

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.860
and from the point of

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.800
view of general economic

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.400
theory would increase the

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.080
overall efficiency

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.320
of these national producers.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.000
The next principle of the GAD

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.480
is regulation of trade

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.760
primarily by tariff methods.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.580
We have again understood that

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.660
in the framework of state

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.900
regulation of foreign trade,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.780
various methods are used,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.200
and one of the most rigid

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.960
methods that generally reduces

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.260
the income of the state,

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.140
and most importantly, tightly

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.000
block the trade flows,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.280
is quota, that is, physical

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.920
restriction of exports.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.140
In contrast, tariff methods allow countries

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.440
- exporters, producers - exporters

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.480
themselves to choose the situation,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.520
whether they want to import goods

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.760
to this country under such tariffs

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.980
and restrictions or not.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.100
In particular, if it is large

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.580
enough firms that are

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.760
interested in seizing

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.480
the national local market, they

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.280
will go on to pay even higher

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.760
tariffs, and protectionism

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.240
in this case will not have

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.840
such a force.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.040
That is, the level of the real rate

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.780
of tariff protection will be much

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.940
lower, precisely because these

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.540
large exporters for such market

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.560
penetration can slightly reduce

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.820
their entry prices.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.420
Then in this case, the price will

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.060
not rise in the domestic market

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.240
as much as it would have risen

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.340
with the increase of tariffs and

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.160
the absence of a drop in world

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.880
prices.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.240
On the other hand, in this case,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.340
although consumers win,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.560
some producers of

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.660
the national economy lose.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.040
But the main idea is that the

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.240
competitiveness factor and

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.620
the maintenance of the competitiveness

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.760
of national producers will

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.720
act, and these firms, foreign

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.400
competitors, will push

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.760
national producers

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.560
to some measures to change

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.500
their production.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.960
This factor is positive.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.520
The following principle of

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.080
GAD is related to the refusal

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.300
to use quantitative restrictions.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.620
The quantitative restrictions

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.040
in this case, I will remind

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.480
you, include not only quotas,

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.720
but rather strict licensing and,

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.540
accordingly, various measures

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.280
associated with the distribution

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.600
of these licenses, often

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.620
not on a competitive basis,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.940
on the basis of the decision

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.260
of any government officials.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.560
In this case, the abandonment

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.100
of quantitative restrictions

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.080
means a world that is acting to

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.900
increase transparency of

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.860
the country’s economic policy,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.400
insofar as, as I have said, the

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.000
decision to give license to some

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.880
officials or not to give, contributes

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.660
to the rent-oriented behavior

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.880
of politicians, and, therefore,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.140
the possibility of developing

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.980
corrupt relations

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.420
that will undoubtedly

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.760
undermine international

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.580
competition.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.360
The next principle that is related

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.140
to the activities of

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.920
the General Agreement on Tariffs

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.220
and Trade is the transparency

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.940
or transparency of trade policy.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.120
It is, of course, related to the fact

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.040
that if countries decide, first,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.920
to limit quantitative restrictions,

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.320
develop a policy that will

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.760
be understandable to both countries,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.520
both the exporter and the importer,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.800
will reduce the risk factor

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.640
that arises in connection

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.880
with the inefficiency

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.440
of policy in decision-making

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:52.320
by somehow reducing opacity

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.280
of economic activity,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.640
will contribute to

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.660
the development of international

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.520
foreign trade.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.500
The last principle I would like to

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.660
draw your attention to is the settlement

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.820
of trade disputes through consultation,

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.900
first and foremost, and negotiations.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.000


00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.120
This system, which exists within the

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.940
framework of the General Agreement

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.120
on Trade Tariffs, attracts

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.860
many countries, as it is sufficiently

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.780
effective and there are

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.360
many appeals from member

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.180
countries to resolve trade disputes.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.660
What are the main functions of the World

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.340
Trade Organization?

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.920
The first function is, of course,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.040
the function of monitoring the

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.400
implementation of those agreements

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.580
that have already been reached

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.880
within the WTO.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.040
The second direction, functional

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.640
WTO, is to conduct multilateral

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.140
trade negotiations in order

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.680
to eventually make further

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.060
decisions on liberalizing

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.460
international economic

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.000
relations.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.680
Solution of trade disputes,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.760
of course, trade wars do

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.260
not lead to improved

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.740
welfare of any of the parties

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.700
involved in these trade

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.040
wars.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.460
Usually, the country of import and the

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.520
country of export are losers.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.700
The next functional direction

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.680
of the WTO is monitoring the

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.760
national trade policies of the

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.660
member countries.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.820
It is an interesting area, which

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.680
I will discuss in more detail later.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.020
Technical assistance to

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.160
developing countries for the development

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:49.840
of export-related programs.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.960
This technical assistance

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.140
is primarily for international

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.980
trade.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.940
The next direction is cooperation

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.580
with international specialized

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.320
organizations, both within

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.600
the WTO and those subdivisions

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.840
that are related to the

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.340
UN, the United Nations.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.080
What are the main advantages of WTO

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.200
membership?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.140
First of all, such fundamental advantages

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.500
can be highlighted here.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.060
First, relations between countries

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.100
members of the WTO are more predictable.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.500
Why is?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.300
Because it is assumed that

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.640
before signing an agreement within

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.060
the WTO, all parties that

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.800
are interested in this,

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:42.920
so to speak, signing

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.420
this agreement, they

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.640
must consult.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.680
This does not mean that

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.860
all 150 WTO member countries

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.000
will sign the agreement

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.880
with each other.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.720
It is assumed that from this group

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.700
will simply stand out, for example,

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.460
a group of countries that

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.580
are interested in the aspect

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.700
that is being developed at

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.480
this time.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.180
For example, let’s take the

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.340
agreement on the liberalization

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.440
of agricultural products.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.080
Not all 150 countries, but

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.800
those that are exporting

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.680
or importing agricultural

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.240
products, will take

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.600
part in these negotiations.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.660
So, the predictability of trade relations,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.680
it is guaranteed in this case

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.440
by the correct WTO

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.160
prescribed.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.900
And here in this same section we need

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.140
to talk about the transparency

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.020
of the foreign economic policy of

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.240
the member countries, which

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.380
is supported by various WTO

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.160
activities, in particular, by

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.660
the analysis of foreign trade policy,

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.460
which is regularly conducted

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.560
for one country or another.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.180
Eliminating discrimination

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.080
in trade is also an advantage, since

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.940
the principle of non-discrimination

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.060
is the second fundamental principle

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.320
of a trade organisation,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.240
which implies that unreasonable

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.600
discriminatory measures cannot

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.920
be applied against

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.480
a member country.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.810
Access to the WTO Dispute Resolution

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.090
Mechanism.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.530
This advantage is to be obtained

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.510
by all those countries that at

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.570
this stage of time are trying

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.190
to enter the WTO and are negotiating

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.910
the entry of the all-rounder

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.990
trade organization.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.190
And the last advantage, which can be

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.890
called in the category of the main,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.910
is the participation in the development

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.790
of these agreements, that is, participation

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.490
in international trade negotiations.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.150
Of course, a WTO member has a greater right

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.190
of voice, it is easier to hear than

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.350
an outsider from this organization.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.190
What is the legal basis

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.150
of a trade organization?

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.350
The WTO system could be called a multilateral

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.930
contract that involves the signing

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.550
of a whole package of

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.530
agreements.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.710
The WTO rules are practically

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.550
applied to most countries, as I

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.550
have said, the 150 most active

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.990
trading partners, and 97

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.310
percent of world trade is controlled

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.610
by the World Trade

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.890
Organization within the

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.230
framework of these rules.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.670
The Uruguay Round, which

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.370
is the basis of the WTO,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.970
has about 50 agreements.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.660
What are the principles of decision-making

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.720
in the World Trade Organization?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.140
This is the consensus method.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.820
It is expected that there are

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.680
very long negotiations between

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.440
all interested in making this decision.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.600
It is supposed that it is better to

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.060
shake down all the disputed issues,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.580
to remove them, than to leave

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.560
a losing side to the very

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.780
minority, which is dissatisfied

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.780
and not satisfied with the decision

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.220
that, suppose, the World

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.500
Trade Organization will take.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.320
In principle, the

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.040
WTO statute allows

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.580
the use of voting

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.360
method by a

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.100
majority vote.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.760
But this practice has not been implemented

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.580
by the World Trade Organization

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.680
so far.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.940
It is the consensus method that allows

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.040
to conclude such contractual

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.540
relationships that are stable

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.160
and that all WTO member

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.520
countries are satisfied with.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.000
What is the decision-making

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.740
structure within the

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.760
World Trade Organization?

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.620
First of all, it is a ministerial

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.320
conference, which meets once

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.700
every two years.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.240
The Ministerial Conference

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.880
is the legislative

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.840
body.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.140
Multilateral agreements,

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.200
packages of agreements are being

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.120
signed or negotiations are

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.780
being held on some issue in order

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.100
to further remove those issues

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.060
that have not been resolved

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.900
at the moment of the negotiation

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.080
round.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.780
In this case, it is a

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.440
legislative body.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.600
All the branches of the World

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.840
Trade Organization are not

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.860
legislative bodies, but

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.140
executive, so to speak, governmental

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.900
structures that help

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.640
implement the decisions

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.800
of the World Trade Organization.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.300


00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.960
The General Council is the most

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.480
important executive body, usually

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.760
composed of ambassadors and

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.720
heads of delegations.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.900
Please look at the slide that represents

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.360
the most generalized structure

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.520
of the peace trade

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.940
organization.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.620
The Ministerial Conference

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.740
is, as we say, a legislative

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.000
body.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.860
The WTO General Council as

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.380
the executive body.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.160
The General Council is bound

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.580
by three functional councils.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.920
It is the Council on Trade in Goods,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.200
the Council on Trade and the Council

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.560
on Trade Aspects of Intellectual

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.760
Property Rights.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.960
Besides the councils

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.980
of such auxiliary, there are trade

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.620
and development committees, budget

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.440
committees, etc., which help

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.780
the WTO General Council

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.660
perform its administrative

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.800
functions.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.520
As I said before, there is

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:34.440
a WTO secretariat, but the secretariat

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:38.460
does not have legislative functions

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.520
and does not make decisions.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.660
This is a service body.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.880
Let us now turn to the issue

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.640
of Russian foreign trade in order

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.200
to finally understand why Russia

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.600
needs to join the World Trade

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:56.940
Organization.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.820
On the one hand, yes,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.940
we looked at the whole

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.220
block of benefits that WTO

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.260
members receive, and especially

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.520
those members that have

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.180
just joined the WTO.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.140
But on the other hand, as I said,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.500
there is a situation where new members

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.060
are subjected to more stringent requirements

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.880
than those members who were

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.700
at the origin of the GAD.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.700
Accordingly, each country, before

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.180
joining the World Trade Organization,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.540
must weigh all the for

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.220
and against of joining

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.620
the World Trade Organization.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.120
Each country should look at what

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.140
concessions it can and cannot make,

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.980
and what preferences it should

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.240
simply demand from those

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.140
countries that are members

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.280
of the World Trade Organization.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.840
What are the characteristics of the

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.260
Russian export structure?

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.300
The term "the world's raw material

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.720
surplus" is associated with

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.160
Russian exports for almost all

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.220
Russian citizens.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.140
This is of course not very pleasant.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.020
The only thing that reassures is that

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.340
since the prices of energy in the

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.420
framework of the modern climate

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.260
are constantly rising, it gives

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.240
the opportunity to use some

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.240
time lag.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.400
This is a chance for oil or gas

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.220
dollars to invest in the

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.360
national economy of Russia and

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.420
try to develop industry

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.700
in the direction of export-

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.000
oriented industries, but not

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.920
related to raw material

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.240
exports, namely, products,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.300
first of all, machinery.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.120
As we can see, 63 percent of

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.060
Russian exports are fuel

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.900
and energy goods.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.340
About 16% are made of metals

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.160
and products.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.320
Metals are also quite raw materials-

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.680
intensive goods and are associated

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.540
with the use of irreplaceable natural

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.120
resources of Russia.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.320
And fairly uniform division is associated

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.900
with the products of

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.320
machinery, chemistry, wood processing.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.040
In the other group we will

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.000
probably include food.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.700
If you look at what companies

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.200
operate in the Russian export

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.440
market, it will prove that

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.400
suppose the exporters are the leading

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.460
sausage plant, which finally

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.780
got a quota in the European

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.060
market.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.220
But this is so small a miserable

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:56.500
share in our companies that,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:02.500
as I said, the main flow of

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.180
goods is connected with

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.540
that sublime energy

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.360
and mental complex.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.500
If we also consider that the class

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.600
of machinery products includes

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.540
military equipment, then, so to

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.820
say, goods not of military production,

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.840
and civil production occupy a very

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.360
small share of Russia's exports.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:37.660
Of course, Russia hopes, after joining

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.660
the World Trade Organization, that

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.700
it will be able to remove some

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.240
of the barriers that are already

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.740
aimed at more competitive products

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.180
in a number of sectors of

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.540
the economy.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.760
If, as I said, a agreed export

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.380
spa for agricultural products

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.840
is eventually created, then, in

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.720
principle, the potential of

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.220
Russia is huge here.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.680
And, as I said before, the World

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.360
Bank calculated at the

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.980
end of the 20th century

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.940
that the Russian grain producers

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.300
would benefit from

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.440
this liberalization.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.500
On the other hand, if you take

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.480
the metal products, there are

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.700
quotas against Russian exports

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.160
around the world.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.320
There is no direct export of metals

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.260
and products from them on the basis of free competition.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.960
The United States introduced quotas

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.140
that were raised in 1998, and this

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.080
has also provoked our financial crisis

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.600
to some extent.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.220
Germany, say, although

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.860
it increases its quota for

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.240
exporting metals to Germany

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.220
every year, it also

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.160
has a quota.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.700
And the most interesting thing is

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.600
that as soon as any of the new industrialized

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.340
countries master and develop its

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.100
metal production, the option

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.240
of quota or any kind of

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.180
anti-dumping sanctions immediately

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.620
arises against Russian exports.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.810
In terms of imports of goods from

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.650
Russia, let’s see what the commodity

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.810
structure of imports is here.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.310
First of all, 48% are related

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.210
to machinery products.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.850
Is it good or bad?

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.490
On the one hand, this proves

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.690
that our domestic engineering

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.030
in most parameters does

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.750
not satisfy our domestic

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.950
manufacturers using

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.910
machines and equipment.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.930
On the other hand, we can say

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.230
that this flow of imports

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.730
of machinery to the Russian

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.110
territory means that many of

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.830
our domestic manufacturers

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.150
are updating their main

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.430
foundations and putting new

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.170
equipment more technological,

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.190
more productive, which has

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.670
a greater productive effect.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.690
And, accordingly, there

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.230
is a possibility associated with the

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.810
fact that if we supply ourselves

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.510
such good products of imported

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.290
machinery, then it is on these machines

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.870
of equipment that we will be

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.210
able to create

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.910
quite competitive finished

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.430
products, which will take

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.130
up not only domestic

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.730
food goods and agricultural

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.770
raw materials occupy

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.190
about 15 percent.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.030
Per this trend is due to the

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.410
fact that often our farming

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.230
plants, our milk-meat

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.750
plants, they were built on

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.670
Western technologies in the

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.050
early 1990s and they are simply

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.230
technologically designed to

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.290
supply precisely specially

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.010
prepared raw materials

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.750
for the production

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.750
of finished food industry.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.850
The next, as we see, is the

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.310
production of the chemical industry.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.290
In this case, it is sufficient to

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.210
import not only finished

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.770
components, but also

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.190
components for chemical

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.830
products, which are

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.910
then used in our Russian production.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.670
If you pay attention, then all powders

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.270
with the imported name are produced

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.130
in Russia, but raw materials and

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.610
components, so to speak, for their

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.110
production are just imported

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.350
on the basis of imported supplies.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.350
The next component, the other.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.670
Of course, there will be

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.130
various companies, which

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.850
again can have quite good

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.790
competition from

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.310
domestic producers.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.850
And I, as I said, hope that equipping

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.010
our enterprises with

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.790
advanced technology and new equipment

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.830
in the long term should ultimately

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.430
lead to the fact that Russian

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.750
imports of goods will

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.630
be more adequate to

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.930
the demands of the developed

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.030
national economy.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.770
But, nevertheless, in recent years, Russian

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.010
imports have increased, and this question

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.770
we will consider with you.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.890
As for Russia’s foreign

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.790
trade turnover, it just

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.230
shows where export

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.390
and import flows are heading.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.730
See, 51% of our export and import

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.310
flows belong to the European

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.510
Union, only 18% to the Asia-

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.950
Pacific region and a small, so

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.410
to speak, smaller percentage

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.330
to another group of countries.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.010
The chart shows us that it is not by chance

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.030
that the main countries that entered

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.030
the commission on Russia’s entry

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.810
into the WTO were the members of the

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.370
European Union.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.990
For a long time, the European

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.750
Union’s representation was commissioned

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.250
by its commissions, commissioned

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.970
to study Russia’s foreign trade

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.190
policy and the EU was the first

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.670
block that began coordinating

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.770
various issues on Russia’

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.290
s accession to the World

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.050
Trade Organization.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.170
With regard to the merchandise simplicity

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.390
of the structure, the foreign trade

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.070
turnover of Russia, we would like

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.150
to give another example.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.210
Despite the fact that I said that

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.230
mostly our flows go to the European

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.410
Union, in the mid-1990s in connection

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.750
with the ruble was relatively expensive,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.330
some of the textile enterprises

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.950
of Russia were able to

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.910
re-equip their production, in particular

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.130
enterprises that sew women's

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.050
coats.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.830
So in that period of time,

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.670
such a paradoxical situation

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.270
emerged when the market for wool

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.930
coats, sewn by Russian manufacturers

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.610
on European medicines,

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.830
grew 20 times.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.170
As a result, the relevant organizations

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.310
and structures, the U.S. Chamber

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.190
of Commerce, were gathered and eventually

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.770
a decision was made on dumping

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.750
and the decision to avat the

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.650
import of the coat.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.090
This is just one of the concrete examples

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.470
that point to the fact that the opportunities

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.950
of Russian manufacturers associated

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.230
with increasing their competitiveness

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.970
in the market will be related

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.390
to the fact that within the framework

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.570
of the World Trade Organization

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.750
they will be able to enter

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.370
the general system of preferences

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:39.050
and the system of non-

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.570
discrimination.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.130
Because now a considerable

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.710
proportion of Russian exports

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.050
is under discriminatory

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.370
regime.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.110
The next thing I would like to draw

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.850
your attention to is the country

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.010
orientation of Russian foreign trade

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:06.150
based on two blocs of countries, namely

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.530
the countries of the near and abroad,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.870
or the countries of the CIS and

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.730
the countries of the far abroad,

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.190
that is, predominantly developed

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.690
countries.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.170
Please note that, in general,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.090
of course, the chart shows

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.070
on the chart that Russian exports

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.050
are constantly growing and

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.230
continue to grow in 2003-2005.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.170
What is the proportion of near

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.490
and far abroad?

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.870
The share of the near abroad is fairly

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.230
stable and the growth is quite small.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.270
But the share of far abroad, just outside

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.530
the CIS countries, it simply, for

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.190
example, jumped sharply in the

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.450
period between 2003 - 2005 and

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.930
continues to grow now.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:00.830
This is not only due to the

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.950
energy consumption in these countries,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.390
it is due to the overall level of

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.330
income and development in these countries.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.170
The richer the economy, as we have

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.290
learned in the course

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.550
of international economic relations,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.110
the more opportunities and capabilities

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.730
they have to participate

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.410
with our country in international

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.550
trade.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.990
Certainly the CIS countries, apparently,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.250
after going through the path of market

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.770
transformations, I hope to increase the

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.270
level of their income and then they will

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.670
also become the object of mutual

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.710
flows between Russia and the near abroad.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.650
Moreover, we are connected

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.090
by quite large historical traditions

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.270
and although over the past 15-17 years

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.430
our production has learned to live

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.290
independently and separately, but

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.470
nevertheless, as soon as the

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.070
crisis situation in these countries

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.570
is less, integration

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.670
ties, mutually beneficial

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.810
ties are again established.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.630
Because the structure of the exports

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.110
of the CIS countries is similar to the

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.750
structure of Russian exports, these

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.870
countries cannot offer the most advanced

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.650
technology in the required

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.570
volume, the machines of

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.750
equipment that occupy a large

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.550
share of our imports.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.530
Per, therefore, the ratio of

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.650
near and far abroad is as

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.130
shown in the scheme

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.290
presented to your attention.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.630
Now let’s pay attention to imports.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:57.350
In this case, the picture is repeated

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.310
again and there are no

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.650
fundamentally new export

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.690
and import solutions.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.110
That is, first of all, imports

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.030
from developed countries

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.690
and accordingly, as

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.950
I said, it is mainly machinery.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.410
And that is why the

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.990
competitiveness of the products offered

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.050
from developed countries is much higher

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.070
than from the countries of the

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.250
former socialist community.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:36.250
In principle, this scheme can change

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.390
with the general development

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.210
of foreign economic relations.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.090
And let us draw your attention to the

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.850
fact that countries that were previously

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.660
members of the Council for Mutual

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.630
Economic Aid and were part

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.090
of the socialist circle are either

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.310
already members of the World Trade

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.610
Organization or are

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.610
claiming to join the

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.490
World Trade Organization.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.370
Thus, they also already got the

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.930
advantages that Russia is trying

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.390
to get by entering it.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.170
And these advantages should

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.270
push their foreign trade turnover

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.650
and, apparently, relations with

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.530
these countries can be more

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.570
developed.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.790
These countries are usually

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.950
located closely with our

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.430
country.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.630
Accordingly, the cost

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.590
of transportation of goods, transportation

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.810
costs here are quite low

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.810
and this advantage is

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.930
not yet fully utilized.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.390
Moreover, the salary level in these countries

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.630
is much lower than in developed

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.230
countries.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.070
Therefore, this is another

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.570
absolute advantage that makes

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.410
products produced in the territory

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.130
of countries close to Russia

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.890
more competitive.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:13.530
And if the positive development

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.610
trends in these countries begin

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.250
to grow, it is possible that the foreign

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.050
trade structure of imports

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.630
in the country range for Russia

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.150
will change over time.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.210
Look at the Russian foreign

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.470
economic indicators.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.670
As you can see, in the last five years,

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.310
the situation has changed a bit.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:43.970
If Russia had a mostly positive

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.790
trade balance before 2003,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.710
then, starting in 2004, the

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.470
foreign trade balance has

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.350
become negative.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.710
What are the reasons for this situation?

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:05.350
The elements of this situation are related,

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.870
first of all, to the economic

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.210
growth in Russia, which has been

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.090
recorded since 2004.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.970
Within the framework of economic theory

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.610
it has always been proven that as

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.990
soon as the gross domestic product of

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.390
the country begins to grow, not only

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.310
is the internal confirmation of the axiom

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.950
of the theory of international economic

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.410
relations manifested in

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.010
the external economic

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.450
indicators of Russia growing.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.450
So, with the growth of income,

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.390
our end consumers and, most

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.810
importantly, our producers

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:53.030
agree to buy a larger share

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.250
of imported products in order

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.890
to raise both their standard

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.470
of living and to upgrade

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.630
the production that should

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.150
be more competitive.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.390
Another factor that affects the fact

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.090
that, since 2004, the foreign trade

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:15.950
saldo has become negative in Russia

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.310
is related to the fact that the Russian

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:25.150
ruble rate is increasing methodically.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.010
Despite the intervention that the Central

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.010
Bank regularly conducts on the currency

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.570
market, it is still not possible

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.510
to reduce the exchange rate

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.010
sharply enough.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.910
We considered that if the currency

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.750
rate of a country increases, it

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.670
will one way or another lead

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.990
to a trend of decreasing exports

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.890
and increasing imports.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.290
Why is?

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.250
Because the ruble is becoming more

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.470
expensive, and now we can

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.130
exchange more foreign currency

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.870
for a more stable, expensive ruble

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.050
and, accordingly, buy more

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.510
imported goods.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.050
On the contrary, the foreign

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.010
consumer of Russian exports is facing

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.730
a situation where the goods offered

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.130
by Russian production have not

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.710
only increased in connection with

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.750
the increase in global prices,

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.470
I mean energy, but

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.570
in principle other groups

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.390
of export products have increased

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.430
precisely because now in

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.850
order to buy this goods at the

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.230
same price, you need to

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.890
exchange more euros or

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.470
dollars for rubles.

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.190
This leads to a relative increase in

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.410
the price of goods.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:53.330
This situation is also known

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.570
to Europe, where Europeans

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.750
are not satisfied with the rise

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.030
of the euro against the US dollar,

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.890
and they even calculated how many

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.650
millions of euros they lost

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.750
there simply from the six-month

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.000
rise of the US dollar.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.260
But I want to draw your attention to the fact

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.040
that during this period of time, 2006-2007,

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.220
the rise in the ruble is not only associated

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.380
with the growth of our exports, it is

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.480
associated with the huge influx of

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:29.900
oil dollars and euros on the territory of

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.400
Russia, it is also associated with the fact

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.660
that the currencies of our foreign

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.160
partners, in particular the United States,

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.640
are subject to fluctuation.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.200
The period 2006-2005 was marked by

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.240
the fact that in this period of

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.360
time the dollar rate was steadily

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:50.540
declining.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.200
On the one hand, the Americans

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.580
just got export gains from such

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.440
a reduction in the ruble rate

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.940
and slightly improved their payment

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.120
and trade balance.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.400
The US partners, Russia,

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.080
should have suffered

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.740
from this situation.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.900
As you can see from the table,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.900
I will repeat again, our net

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.320
exports increased in negative,

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.620
it became unbalanced.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.240
As the US market is changing in

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.520
the stabilization of the dollar,

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.860
this trend was already marked

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.640
in 2007, when the US Central

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.740
Bank has already raised the refinancing

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.120
rate by a percentage

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:39.560
point, which gives the

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.480
opportunity to balance

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.460
Russia’s foreign trade

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.460
flows.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.700
As you can see, exports and imports

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.200
are influenced by a large

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.720
number of factors, both currency

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:56.240
and demand.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.280
In terms of demand, I would like

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.400
to point out that the growth of

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.440
our exports will still depend on

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:05.760
the growth of gross domestic

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.220
product abroad.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.760
That is, as far as countries, the

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:11.300
main consumers of our exports,

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.560
I mean Western Europe, as you

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.120
saw on the chart, is 60% of our

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.940
exports, as far as Western

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.080
Europe will maintain a stable

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.040
economic growth, so much

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.980
our goods in the Western

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:28.460
European market will

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:30.140
be in demand.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.500
If, God give it, their development

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.700
is somehow disrupted and there is some

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.500
economic decline, then our exports

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.540
may be reduced even more,

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:42.020
and for us this will be an

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.580
unwanted situation.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.880
From my example, you can see

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.440
how closely connected

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.640
all countries in the world are

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.520
by export and import flows.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.420
Therefore, in principle, the common

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.880
prosperity of one country cannot be

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.340
without the prosperity of neighbors

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:04.420
and more distant neighbors, since these

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:06.520
interrelated export-import flows

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.540
raise the overall economic development

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:12.760
of all countries in the world.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.060
Based on this, it is clear why the

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.560
countries outside the World

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.820
Trade Organization are trying

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.880
to join this negotiating integration

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.900
process and participate in the

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.520
World Trade Organization

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.180
rauts, to be an equal member

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.720
of the World Trade Organization.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.190
Look at the following chart for the

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.850
dynamics of export and import in the

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.250
last period of time.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:52.470
The balance of foreign trade

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.410
is generally positive.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.890
As you can see, these red-yellow

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.650
stripes reflect the positive

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.110
balance of foreign

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.130
trade on the chart.

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:12.380
And this is due to the fact that prices

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.900
are generally on a positive balance

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.140
of the year 2005.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:22.120
Prices of Russian exports have

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:23.800
increased.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.880
Based on this, the volume of Russian

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.640
value exports in some periods

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.400
of time increases due to the price

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:35.160
jump.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.600
Pay attention to 2007.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.360
In January, both imports

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:41.520
and exports fell.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.100
Probably it is tradition.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.580
See, again in January 2005 the decline,

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:47.600
it is the tradition of falling

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.840
demand in Christmas some New Year

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:51.060
period of time, and then

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.560
the trend of international

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.760
trade is gaining strength

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:58.460
again.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.900
What are the objectives and objectives of Russia’

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.940
s accession to the World Trade Organization?

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.400
Of course, these goals can be

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.560
formulated in connection with the

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.900
benefits that any country that has

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.000
become a member of the World

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.800
Trade Organization receives.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.820
The first goal is to obtain

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.680
non-discriminatory conditions

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:24.720
for access to foreign markets

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:27.540
for Russian products.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.760
As I have already given an example,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.740
there are quite strict rules

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.840
of discrimination on a number

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.120
of goods that are quite

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:40.520
competitive in the world market.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.040
Furthermore, access to the mechanism

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:49.760
for settling trade disputes, which

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.600
is well-developed within

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.580
the framework of the World Trade

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:55.640
Organization, is very important

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.980
for Russia and is not accidentally

00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.560
used by more and more

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:03.040
WTO member countries.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.240
On the other hand, if we become

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.140
members of the WTO, it means that

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.140
in principle most countries

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.640
in the world do not conflict

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:16.280
with us on trade, commodity and other

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.260
positions that fall within

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:21.180
the jurisdiction of the WTO.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.000
Our foreign policy

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.140
is becoming more

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.360
predictable.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.660
When countries join the World Trade

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.320
Organization, one of the requirements

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.000
in the WTO process is the harmonization

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:41.620
of domestic laws with WTO rules

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:43.640
and norms, with international,

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.840
so to speak, standards.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.700
International standards

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:49.780
envisage the liberalization

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.980
of domestic legislation in

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.380
relation to foreign investors.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.380
Thus, creating a blatant

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.980
clearing for investment is

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:02.680
also one of the goals of Russia’

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.340
s accession to the WTO.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.660
If you look at the statistics,

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.280
investors have reacted

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.860
very strongly to the fact that in

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.240
2006-2007 Russia was facing

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.980
a violent conviction with

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.100
all conflicting countries

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.360
or interested countries about

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.600
joining the WTO.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.520
And we have an influx of foreign

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.580
investment into Russia increased

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:33.520
to almost 40% in the first

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.600
quarter of 2007 compared to the

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.880
first quarter of 2006.

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.980
Why this happens?

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.720
It appears that foreign investors

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:46.840
are expecting Russia’s accession

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.060
to the WTO and are trying to take

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.540
positions in advance.

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:52.740
There is also a flow of reinvestments.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:53.760


00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.500
When domestic producers who

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:00.120
exported excess capital

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.780
abroad because they saw less

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.260
risky use of this capital

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:07.800
on Russian territory,

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:09.800
they were less likely to

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.960
invest money abroad, this

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.220
capital also begins to

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.940
return to the Russian

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:16.960
economy.

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:19.640
This process began in 2003

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:22.360
and continues to this day.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.500
Accordingly, the WTO membership

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.040
will be a laxmuse paper,

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.340
an indicator that will show

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.380
foreign investors to

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:35.120
come, invest, develop,

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.840
organize and create new

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:38.660
jobs on modern technologies

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:40.700
in Russia.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.540
Someone is scared of the

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.100
arrival of foreign investments

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:47.660
in Russian territory.

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.080
But note, even with this seemingly

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:52.020
stormy growth, what figures can

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:54.060
we give – 10, 20, 30 percent growth

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.640
over the last few years, nevertheless,

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:00.660
the share of foreign investment

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.240
in the total investment

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.640
of the domestic economy

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.420
is insignificant, that

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:09.720
is, the percentage there rises

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:12.120
slightly to 10 percent.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.540
In this case, Russia does

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:17.000
not experience any investment

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.560
risk.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.960
Well, if we recall the examples of new

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.920
industrialized countries that have

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:26.080
rapidly developed exports of developing

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.940
industries, and not raw materials,

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:31.020
namely industrial, then these exports

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.520
developed industries, first of

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:36.640
all, were created at the expense

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:38.820
of foreign investments.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.680
Russia has in this case favorable

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:45.000
opportunities for implementation

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.800
of such investment plans.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:51.000
In addition to the fact that these plans

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:52.600
will be beneficial to domestic consumers,

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.240
but it is also possible that Russian

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.220
products will go to the foreign

00:58:56.230 --> 00:59:00.600
market from such imported sources

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.360
of production.

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.340
What does it have to do with?

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:10.540
First of all, in Russia, sufficiently

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.320
developed, educated industrial

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.240
personnel.

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.020
And while we, so to speak, have

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:19.200
not yet spread this potential, it is

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:22.860
possible that when training personnel

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:24.240
in accordance with new technologies

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.700
of marketing and management,

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:27.580
which are generally occurring

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:29.200
in a number of our domestic

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.780
enterprises, will allow

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.240
to attract domestic workforce.

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.620


00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:38.640
And it will attract foreign investors

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:41.380
in Russia not only cheap raw

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.780
materials and energy, but also

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:46.800
the possibility of organizing

00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:50.840
such competitive production.

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.280
The next factor that will affect Russia’

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:57.240
s accession to the WTO is the possibility

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:06.720
of increasing I have already said

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.720
in the current international economic

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:12.760
relations that transnational

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.400
corporations are represented not

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.000
only in the Western economy and

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.540
in the group of developing countries.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.740
In Russia, they are called

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.340
international monopolies,

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.660
and financial and industrial

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.520
groups are called.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.260
So the financial and industrial groups

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.120
of Russia, they also already

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:38.140
feel the limitation of

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:39.520
the territorial capabilities

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.740
of Russia and agree to invest abroad.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.180
The next task of Russia’s accession

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.140
to the WTU is related to the expansion

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.940
of opportunities for Russian investors

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:51.880
in the WTU member countries.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.040
The situation in the Russian economy

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.360
is so that our transnational

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.300
corporations, which I have already

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.200
mentioned in the section of international

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.360
economic relations, also face

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.820
a situation when they do not

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:08.080
find adequate spheres of

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.440
application with their capital

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:12.260
on the territory of Russia.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.920
On the other hand, given that our

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:17.060
transnational corporations are closely

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.100
related to the gas sector,

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.340
namely, Gazprom, then, of

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.780
course, construction

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:27.560
and investment applications,

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.680
this corporation involves

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:33.020
facilitating the export of

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.720
Russian gas abroad.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.520
Therefore, the expansion of such

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.140
opportunities for investment

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:46.800
in WTO member countries is also a

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.880
significant factor for the

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.540
Russian economy.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.740
The establishment of cooperative

01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:00.160
ties between countries and WTO

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.200
members with the inclusion of

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.540
Russia in this industrial cooperation

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.360
again may be related to Russian

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.740
investments in countries and

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.380
in NGOs, so this is a

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.020
fairly progressive positive

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.700
process, and Russia may look in

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.700
this direction from joining the

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.520
world trade organizations.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.000
The next factor of Russia’s participation

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.880
in the WTO is the creation of conditions

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.200
for improving the quality

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.620
and competitiveness of the reporting products.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.580
After all, if the relations of the member

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:38.360
countries of the World Trade Organization

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.400
require liberalization of foreign

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.500
trade, the same requirement will

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.160
be introduced to our country.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.100
Of course, the level of liberalization

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.840
of our foreign trade relations is already

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.600
high enough, but once again, the

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.340
access of those foreign competitors

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.860
to our market will make domestic

01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.380
manufacturers think about

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:01.300
increasing the competitiveness

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.440
of their products.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.260
And despite the fact that, of course,

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.180
such a harsher competition

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.040
from the part of foreigners after Russia's

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.360
accession to the WTO will not

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.380
occur immediately, since each

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:19.680
new member country receives the right

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:21.220
to a certain transitional period,

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.040
in the presence of which its

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.460
producers will

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:27.820
adapt to the new situation.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.700
However, many manufacturers are

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:36.340
already thinking about the future

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:39.560
and increasing competition in the

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:41.300
Russian market.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.860
And this is reflected in the fact

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:47.480
that on the territory of the Russian

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.680
regions are held regular meetings

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:56.040
at the level of heads of regions and

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:58.220
various communities of Russian

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:05.200
industrialists of regional location.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.620
These meetings will help

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.140
to figure out what

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:15.020
risks the Russian manufacturers

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.960
face when joining the

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.800
WTO and what advantages.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.000
And as reports on such meetings

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:24.820
show, it turns out, often

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.500
Russian industrialists

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.460
and producers have limited information

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:30.500
about the advantages that

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:32.960
the WTO gives and their idea

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.420
of how and in what

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:39.540
ways, what steps Russia will

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:42.120
enter the WTO, about what

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.320
barriers will remain

01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:47.320
for the transitional period

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.980
are quite limited.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.860
Based on this, such consultations

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.500
with Russian industrial manufacturers,

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:55.120
taking place throughout the territory

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.780
of Russia, they promote the

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:00.740
understanding of this process

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.660
and produce a positive response

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:05.340
and feedback.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.900
That is, on the one hand, yes,

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.000
accept this situation as more

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:10.720
promising for the development of

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.360
Russia, and on the other hand,

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.100
to think about how to

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:16.540
increase the competitiveness

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.960
of its own production.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.280
As analytical studies show,

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.700
less than 50% of Russian

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.880
manufacturers thought

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.760
about Russia’s entry into

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.560
the WTO five years ago.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.620
At present, this figure has increased

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:40.540
sharply, and everyone understands,

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:42.400
on the one hand, what advantages,

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:45.120
and on the other hand, what shortcomings

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.080
are related to their organizational

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:48.960
activities and how prepared

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.140
or not prepared for Russia's accession

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:54.260
to the WTO.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.700
The next factor and task that will

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.460
be solved in the framework of Russia’

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:02.160
s accession to the WTO.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:06.220
This is Russia’s participation in the

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.380
development of international trade rules

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:11.100
and compliance with the defense of

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:13.000
its interests, national interests.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.360
I have already mentioned that the Doha

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:19.400
Round is dedicated to developing

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:22.260
the problems of liberalization of agriculture.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.800
In this case, Russia has rich

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.180
lands, natural agricultural

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:31.540
resources, opportunities.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.780
There is a high potential for the development

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.620
of the agricultural sector.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.340
And in general, its development is

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.160
not only in the direction of ensuring

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.760
domestic consumption, but also

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.340
penetration into the European market.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:52.260
As the latest history of Russia shows,

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:56.020
our agricultural workers do not

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:59.620
constantly experience the situation of crisis.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.380
Each time period is repeated

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.780
a fairly high harvest.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:09.000
But, as practice shows, often

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.540
public procurement

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.680
of agricultural products does

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.100
not cover the excess supply, for

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.520
example, grain and other

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.060
agricultural goods.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.060
And then, for the next year,

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.920
agricultural producers simply

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:25.160
reduce the volume of their

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.640
production supply.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.400
As I said in my course on international

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:30.540
economic relations, such

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.640
a surplus situation in the world

01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:34.960
free space is usually resolved

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:37.540
by the fact that such naturally

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:40.260
created surpluses, well, and,

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.680
of course, by the hard work

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.540
of Russian agricultural

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.220
workers, they can be

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:46.940
realized precisely by

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:47.960
export.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.200
Russia, in fact, within these all

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.700
sorts of quota restrictions,

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:54.320
such chances do not have

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:56.640
or have very limited scale.

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.020
In the end, this leads to negative

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:01.080
consequences, in essence, to

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.560
overproduction in some periods,

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.940
in some years in agriculture,

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.800
to the ruin of these

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:08.740
agricultural ones.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.400
The next component, so to speak,

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.700
is the benefits for Russia from joining

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:19.760
the World Trade Organization, the

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.860
next component is the improvement

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:24.680
of Russia’s image as a full

01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:26.860
participant in international

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.360
trade.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.440
While Russia is not a WTO

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.360
member, certain countries, governments

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:34.620
of certain countries or some

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:36.180
economic agents from some countries

01:08:36.190 --> 01:08:39.700
have the opportunity or the opportunity

01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:43.780
to discriminate against

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.180
Russia and, accordingly,

01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:47.580
prove some of their

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.800
rights to discriminate

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:54.700
against trade flows.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.400
This is the most case-specific example

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:07.960
of the Venec amendment in the United

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.160
States, according to which once

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:14.740
on the socialist Russia were imposed

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.280
restrictions on the export of advanced

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:21.040
technologies, on discrimination,

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.920
on export-import relations

01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.220
in connection with the restrictions

01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:26.880
that Russia then imposed

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:30.940
on the exit of Jews from Russia.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.140
In this case, despite the fact

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.180
that Russia in the new speech,

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.560
recognized a market, not a transitional

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.100
transformational economy,

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:44.780
the amendment is still in effect.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.620
And the amendment of Jones Venek,

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.300
it is clear that it is a

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.660
precedent, is to such a discriminatory

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:54.720
attitude of Russia.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:58.720
Although this amendment is suspended

01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:00.940
annually by the US President,

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:04.140
it has not been lifted.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.680
Despite the fact that, suppose, the negotiations

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.480
of Russia and the United States on Russia’s accession

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:10.460
to the WTO have already been completed,

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.220
and the precedent of the amendment remains.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.960
And the US says that only when Russia becomes

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.060
a WTO member, we will then eliminate

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:19.340
this amendment.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.420
In this case, there is no longer

01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:23.300
the country against which the amendment

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.880
was introduced, the object of the amendment

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.040
has changed.

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:29.920
Nevertheless, this is the

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.680
political pressure that remains,

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.660
and in this case, the image

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:37.800
of confrontation for Russia,

01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:40.780
when it enters some international

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:43.080
economic relations, remains.

01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:47.890
What are the main objectives of the Russian

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.610
accession negotiations to the WTO?

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.330
First of all, as I said, we need to

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:56.390
weigh the price of accession, that

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.170
is, what benefits and advantages

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.810
Russia will get from joining the

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.310
WTO, to these benefits and advantages.

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:05.010
On the other hand, what concessions

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.010
Russia is prepared to make for this

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.430
accession, to what level it should

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.650
reduce tariffs and to what extent

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.610
it has opened its domestic markets.

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:18.990
We and you remember that the World

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.410
Trade Organization does not mean

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:27.250
such a consistent trade.

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.490
Although all countries have agreements

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.650
on GAD, GAC, TRIPS and TRIMS, each

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.250
country, however, imposes within

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.810
a certain period of time those

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.270
restrictions which they consider

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.150
reasonable and reasonable, and

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.030
within the framework of the

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.350
agreement with the WTO these

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.250
restrictions pass.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.790
In this case, the task of Russian representatives

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.730
at the negotiations is to greater

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:57.010
advantages or at least to balance

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.930
the situation of losses and

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.530
benefits from Russia’s

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.130
accession to the WTO.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:12.460
Agreements on GAD goods.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.820
I would like to draw your attention

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:19.080
to the fact that the General

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:23.560
Agreement of 47 years ago, as I

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:26.700
said, was the basis for the

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:32.680
agreement of countries to join

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:34.380
the World Trade Organization.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.540
But before the organization

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.220
in the World Trade Organization

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:41.720
there was a new round of negotiations,

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:45.220
and the 94th General Agreement

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:51.060
contains additional positions.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.100
First, the 1994 agreement

01:12:56.110 --> 01:13:00.160
contains specific sector

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:02.060
agreements, namely agriculture

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.100
and textiles.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.340
In this regard, Russia, joining the WTO

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.260
at the present stage, rather than before

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.260
the 95th year, just gets some

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:17.200
advantages in this area, that

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:20.200
is, in the development of the

01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:21.840
agreement, in the end, participation

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:22.880
in the development

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:24.600
of the agreement on agriculture

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.700
and textile.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.860
The next component of GAD

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.600
94 is state trade.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.660
There are, of course, negative

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:38.680
points for Russia, because

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.660
within these agreements, government

01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.060
orders on foreign trade must

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.120
be distributed on a

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.560
basis.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.060
The tradition of the Russian economy

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.120
is associated with a

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.760
certain vulgarism of officials

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.120
who distribute certain

01:13:57.130 --> 01:14:01.940
government orders.

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:04.840
The next issue is related to the

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:07.640
standards for different products.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.200
The Russian standards have traditionally

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:13.120
been quite high.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.660
A conditionally primitive example is

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:17.960
how the amount of meat in the high-

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:20.460
quality Russian sausage is usually

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:23.800
higher than the same standards, for

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:26.660
example, concerning the European Union.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.420
But the same standards

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.900
are quite strict

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:35.300
in our drugs.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.040
And it is not by chance that, for

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:41.080
example, India recently entered into the discussion

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.740
of agreements on Russia’s accession

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.500
to the WTO under the GAD section.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.980
India is the largest

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:50.720
exporter of

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:51.960
medicines.

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:57.340
And if Russia stands in the position

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:59.500
of adopting such international standards,

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:01.420
which are usually accepted in the

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.260
World Trade Organization, and lower

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.860
some of its standards, it is

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:07.920
likely that this country will

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.920
get a greater opportunity to

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.720
penetrate the Russian market.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.820
As for subsidies.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.560
Indeed, the 1994 agreement

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:23.360
also includes subsidy

01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:26.640
issues.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.300
The issue of subsidies is

01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:35.740
the most painful issue in modern

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.500
doharound negotiations.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:38.880
Why is?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:39.980
First of all, it is

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.520
about agricultural

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:43.700
export subsidies.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.100
Of course, Russia, becoming

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:48.640
a participant in these negotiations,

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.540
can get certain preferences.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.420
And now, before joining

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.920
the EU, it must agree on

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:56.800
what level to fix protective

01:15:56.810 --> 01:16:06.760
barriers for entitled to subsidies.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.580
The next aspect, which was linked

01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:10.920
to the new GATT 1994 version,

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.960
is anti-dumping measures.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.680
In this regard, Russia has made

01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:17.380
a great progress, because in the new

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:21.100
XXI century anti-dumping legislation

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.840
and various on the territory

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:32.800
of Russia and the introduction

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:35.500
of anti-dumping sanctions

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:36.840
were adopted.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.140
I have already said that Russian

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.660
export flows are quite strongly limited

01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:46.780
in different directions, and

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.800
not only in the direction of the United

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:50.480
States and Western Europe,

01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:53.000
but even in the direction of the

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.100
Asian region, to new developed

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.040
countries.

01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:59.180
Once the countries have been

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.500
able to develop their heavy industry

01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:03.880
thoroughly enough, obstacles are

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:06.220
set and proved by the dumping

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.480
situation on, for example,

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.020
Russian goods, in particular,

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:13.500
metal production.

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.740
Now, of course, in general, in connection

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.060
with the rise of world prices

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:21.920
for various commodity-intensive

01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:24.380
goods, which are the main component

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.160
of Russian exports, such

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:30.300
dumping claims from buyers

01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:34.640
are coming to Russia less

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.820
and less.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.720
This is due to the fact that, for example,

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.680
mostly disputes with Russia

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:45.960
about dumping were from the 90s to 95s.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.060
It was during this period that Russia

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:50.280
was accused of a large number

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.180
of dumping charges and did not take

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.060
into account that the country at

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:58.880
this time was no longer a centralized

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:00.560
socialist economy.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.180
Indeed, the exporters used

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:03.720
some of their specific

01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.800
advantages associated with

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.280
cheap raw materials and

01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:09.060
cheap labor.

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:11.040
But since Russia was not yet

01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:12.600
recognized as a market economy

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.960
at that time, these anti-

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:17.820
dumping processes were heard and

01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.680
decisions were made on recognizing

01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:22.840
the dumping, and Russian exporters

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:25.240
were punished seriously enough,

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.620
thus curbing the flow

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:28.680
of exports from Russia,

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:30.140
which at that time was

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:31.520
in a rather crisis

01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:32.720
situation.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.580
For her, of course, export

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.640
revenues were significant

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:39.760
and important in supporting

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:47.460
some economic growth.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.700
As I said before, this is the principle

01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:51.880
of non-discrimination, which

01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:54.520
is implemented through the application

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.200
of the regime and the greatest favor.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.840
In this case, having obtained this

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:04.400
option, Russia will be able

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:10.740
to protect itself from various

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.080
claims on dumping.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.340
The principle of national regime

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.760
will allow at least to remove

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:21.360
the Venice amendment or some

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.080
other restrictive legislative

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.280
acts that act against

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.820
Russian exports.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.820
The abolition of quantitative restrictions

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.240
in favor of tariffs.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.100
In this case, this principle is already

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:36.040
strong enough in Russian exports

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.100
and is present in Russian imports.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.540
The new tariff legislation

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:42.340
was introduced during

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:47.400
the last edition of 2003-2002.

01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.000
During this period of time,

01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:50.600
we tried to bring all our tariffs

01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:53.440
in line, to prepare Russia’s accession

01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:56.120
to the WTO and, of course, to

01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:02.020
come to the tariffization of the system

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:04.520
of external economic barriers

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:05.880
as much as possible.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.420
The principle of publicity, transparency

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:16.740
in trade and development of

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.580
foreign trade legislation is, of

01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:22.960
course, a principle that in Russia

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:25.580
cannot be solved in one day.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.060
And at least these agreements,

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:29.600
which are taking place within

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:33.080
the WTO, help the Russian

01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:35.680
economy and Russian law to

01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:38.940
be more outspoken and transparent.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.140
If you look at the fundamental principles

01:20:41.150 --> 01:20:43.300
of the following, the agreement of

01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:44.960
the World Trade Organization (WTO),

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:47.680
that is, the agreements related to services,

01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:51.960
the purpose in this case of this

01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:53.560
agreement is the free export and

01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:55.800
import of services, regardless of

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.420
the method of their delivery.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.240
In accordance with this,

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.200
it is assumed that not only

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:04.280
commercial structures, but also

01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:06.760
individuals can freely provide

01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:09.220
services.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.280
Here there is a situation that

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:18.900
develops in such a way that the

01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:21.560
principle of the regime of

01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:23.440
the greatest favor and the principle

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.480
of the national regime is valid

01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:27.820
within this agreement so far with

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:30.460
exceptions, unlike the GAC, that is,

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.100
the agreement on trade tariffs.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.320
And these principles are basically

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.020
implemented only on individual

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:39.000
binding countries, only on

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:41.040
bilateral agreements.

01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:44.520
What sectors of the economy, what

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.820
sectors of services, to what extent

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:49.700
are ready to open up to foreign competition.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.220
This includes banking

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.440
services, especially insurance

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:55.100
services.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.220
As you can see, this is a big

01:21:57.230 --> 01:22:00.660
financial interest.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.760
Therefore, countries lobby

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:06.480
national, transnational banks

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:09.020
and corporations to limit

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.220
the free access of foreign

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:14.080
competition to these areas.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.740
As for the agreement, to institutional

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.960
level prepare its legislation

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:30.000
and reform its legislation

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:31.040
to meet the requirements

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.160
of the WTO.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.780
In particular, this applies to

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:38.120
the new version of the copyright

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:41.340
infringement law, which happened

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:46.020
in the spring of 2007 to eventually

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.140
reduce the flow of pirated

01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:53.800
products that goes to the Russian

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:57.240
audio, video and software

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.920
market.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.900
In this case, on the other hand,

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.080
this agreement defends the rights

01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:07.680
of Russian producers of

01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:09.720
similar products.

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.960
Therefore, the action of

01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.500
this agreement, if we join the

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:18.160
WTO, pushes to make the real reality

01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:21.700
in the field of financial

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:27.860
services and information

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.660
services correspond to world

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:32.000
standards.

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:35.260
Please note that the TRIPS Agreement

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:37.400
treats intellectual property

01:23:37.410 --> 01:23:39.760
fairly broadly.

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.300
This includes not only copyright

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:44.420
and trademarks or, for example,

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:46.480
geographical names and the use

01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:49.020
of product denominations.

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:50.680
Also included are industrial design

01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:53.660
samples, integrated chip topologies,

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:56.300
and even unresolved information,

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:59.040
such as trade sectors.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:05.040
Based on this, of course, in the

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:07.480
conditions of growing competition

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:09.600
of the modern market, in the conditions

01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:11.300
of the development of so-called

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:13.060
industrial or corporate espionage,

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:17.620
the development of the rules of the

01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:20.420
game and the most important follow-

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.880
up of these rules for Russia is also

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:24.400
a factor of increasing

01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:26.180
competitiveness and including

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:28.440
the competitiveness of its products.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.240
It is no secret that, as part

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:32.880
of the violation of intellectual

01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:34.040
property rights of Russian

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:36.720
production, the situation in Russia

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:43.160
was simply deplorable during the period

01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:45.580
of the 98th year, when this flow

01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:47.960
of intellectual information, not

01:24:47.970 --> 01:24:50.680
protected by copyright, literally

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.660
went west with packets and, as they

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:58.260
say, the market of offering Russian

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.500
technologies was simply stuck.

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:05.140
Based on this, of course, the inclusion

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.000
of Russia in such an adequate

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:11.440
international standard process

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:14.680
will protect not only foreign intellectual

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:16.260
property producers, but

01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:17.800
also domestic, which will increase

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:20.480
Russia's competitiveness, and most

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:22.960
importantly in the long term will

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.740
allow Russia to leave such

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.100
a cliché of the factory not the

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:33.060
factory of the world, but the

01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:35.120
raw material additive

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.140
of the world.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.300
I would like to also focus on such

01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:41.120
a component structure of the

01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:43.340
World Trade Organization as the

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.640
development of agreements

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:50.080
on rules for dispute resolution.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.020
The first is to resolve

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:54.180
disputes during

01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:57.000
consultation.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.000
In the second phase, the decision

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:01.960
is made by a group of experts.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.240
In the third phase, appeals are filed

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:07.300
against the decision.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.940
And the agreement on the rules

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:12.540
of dispute resolution is also a

01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:15.420
rather beneficial area for Russia

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:17.900
after joining the WTO, as countries

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.860
are treating this dispute

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:24.440
resolution system with

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:25.680
confidence.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.340
If you look closely, then if during

01:26:40.410 --> 01:26:43.700
this period of the Commission on

01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:48.540
disputes only 300 cases, only

01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:53.220
by March 1999 has been considered

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.540
and submitted, so to speak, for consideration

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.940
167 cases.

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.460
Thus, the trust in this system

01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:04.800
is quite high, and it is very

01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:07.000
profitable for Russia to come

01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.940
to some optimal solution that

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:12.940
will not contradict the

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:15.240
interests of the Russian country,

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:17.140
based on mutual international

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.940
agreements and balancing

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:22.100
disputes.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.120
The next component

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:27.200
of the WTO agreement is the

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:29.800
mechanism for reviewing

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.420
trade policy.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.280
This is a very fundamental

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.920
study, which is conducted

01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:39.520
by WTO groups, since

01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:44.080
1995 only 45 member

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:47.080
countries have been

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.300
reviewed.

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.140
That is, it is not expected that

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:53.620
all 150 members are subject

01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:57.720
to a permanent review of trade policy.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:01.560
45 countries are the world’s leading countries.

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.200
After all, such a mechanism forces

01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:07.300
the public of the governments

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.660
of these countries to

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.460
look critically at the system

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.640
that in the field of state

01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.860
regulation, foreign trade,

01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.340
develops in these countries.

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:21.340


01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.680
Therefore, such regular analytical

01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:27.220
studies and reviews are

01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:29.360
an important component of

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:33.000
raising the prestige of

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:35.480
the country, raising investment

01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.620
attractiveness.

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:40.720
If you want trade stability and in

01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:44.780
particular, if the country has received

01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:46.460
some bonuses, positive assessments

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.860
as a result of such a study,

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.440
there is a proven increase in

01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:53.680
transparency in the explanation

01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:56.040
of trade policy, then the conclusion

01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:59.560
of course acts as a certain

01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:08.420
when exporting its products

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.760
and large competitors benefits

01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:15.630
when inviting, or attracting

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.350
foreign investments

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.830
to its territory.

01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:25.370
So, let’s see what advantages the WTO

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.570
trade system offers in the first place

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.310
in terms of seemingly general

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.630
conclusions.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.250
See from the consumer’s point of view.

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:38.270
First of all, once barriers

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.050
that cross the trade borders

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:46.850
of different countries

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.370
are opened, it is assumed that

01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.690
products begin to

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.810
move more freely, and therefore

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.970
the supply volume increases.

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:57.150
The growth of the supply does not mean

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.150
only the growth of the range, a

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:01.230
wide range of goods and services.

01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:04.590
The increase in supply on export

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.030
imports and depreciation usually means

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.270
a decrease in prices.

01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:17.550
And then the price drop will affect

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.290
the cost of the consumer

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.190
basket or cost of living,

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.630
which will have a positive

01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:26.870
impact on the final consumers

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.290
of the national economy.

01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:32.190
But we should pay attention to the

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.870
fact that the removal of such foreign

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.910
trade barriers means a price reduction

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.330
not only for goods related to final

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.010
consumption, i.e. there clothing, food,

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.790
and so on, but is related to

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.230
a price reduction for components

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.630
that are imported into the

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.890
national economy.

01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:55.870
And although the principle of

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.750
tariff escalation, which we talked

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.810
about in the course of Mayoo, usually

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:04.070
applies in economies, suggests that

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.650
usually raw materials and components

01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:09.470
are imported at lower tariffs, and

01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:12.830
finished products are closed by

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.010
a barrier with higher tariffs.

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:17.330
But nevertheless, the greater

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.010
liberalization of the

01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:22.910
import of components leads to the

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.410
fact that domestic goods that

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.270
use these components are

01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:28.090
also becoming cheaper.

01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:30.030
Thus, the national producer

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.910
with its commodity products

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.250
becomes more competitive

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.030
both on the domestic market

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.950
and, possibly, on the international.

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:38.810


01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.170
Accordingly, from the consumer point

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.430
of view, the advantage of liberalization

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.710
of foreign trade is present.

01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:49.710
Another component that indirectly

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.110
affects consumers

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.670
is the growth of exports.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.910
It would seem that the growth

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.330
of exports is only won by the manufacturer,

01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:57.510
but in factories, say, enterprises,

01:31:57.750 --> 01:32:03.750
in some firms, exporters,

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.390
the Russian citizens are employed

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.110
first of all.

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.610
Accordingly, the growth of exports

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.130
means first of all the growth of

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.650
their incomes, and once their incomes

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.690
grow, the multiplier effect is

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:21.350
generally acting and the entire Russian

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.890
economy is beginning to grow.

01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:27.670
The International Bank for Reconstruction

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.690
and Development, as well as

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.010
various World Trade Organization

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.490
structures, estimated that

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.510
the cost of trade barriers

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:46.430
is causing £500 million

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.830
of damage to British consumers

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.410
annually, and it is because

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:56.550
these barriers are primarily

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:00.410
related to textile imports.

01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:03.350
On the other hand, Canada.

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:08.930
Canadians are bound by the same

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.110
agreement, in the same

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.510
direction, on imports of textiles,

01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:15.930
too, by certain barriers.

01:33:16.110 --> 01:33:18.550
Canadians overpay for their

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.830
clothes from -the import

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.330
barriers for textiles of

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.410
$780 million.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:29.830
On the other hand, if we take

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:33.130
the European Union, which liberalized

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:35.450
barriers within its integration

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:38.090
group, the liberalization

01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:40.790
of telecommunications

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.470
sectors in the European Union

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.630
led to a drop in prices on telecommunications

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.610
services on average

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.930
by 7-10%.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.890
Thus, even without calculating the

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.330
winnings of Russian consumers in

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.530
the Russian market, there

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.870
are quite a large number of examples

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.790
of statistical calculations, which

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.050
show how much consumers lose

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.350
or win in countries, members

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.070
of the World Trade Organization

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.330
or in countries that have

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.730
entered the path of integration

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.670
within integration

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.150
unions.

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:26.850
If you look at the general benefits

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.370
of joining the World Trade Organization

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:33.030
for the country, then in general, according

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.670
to the postulates of both the theory

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.490
of international economy and economic

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.730
theory, if you remember, we and

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.390
you discussed once in the section of

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.270
state regulation of foreign trade

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.690
the arguments for and against

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.010
tariffs, so these same arguments

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:48.630
for and against work in the

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.410
direction that we can quite clearly

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.930
determine the direction of the

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:58.610
common benefits of Russia's entry

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:00.000
into the world trade power.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.540
First of all, it is an increase in the

01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:05.000
country’s income.

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.940
At the same time, the state

01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:10.860
income increases, as the flow of

01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:14.040
goods and taxes in this case are

01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:16.280
collected not so much from

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:19.380
customs barriers, but the state

01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:22.080
receives income from the overall

01:35:22.090 --> 01:35:24.300
growth of the economy and,

01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:25.780
accordingly, for example,

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.520
collects a tax on profit or

01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:29.320
value added in a larger amount.

01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:31.000
The state still has incomes that

01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:32.340
are growing, and it will

01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.400
not lose from the fact that

01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:36.860
it will not collect higher foreign

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:39.240
trade taxes.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.340
And, accordingly, personal incomes are

01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:43.520
also growing, as I said before.

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.460
The owners of the factors

01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:47.080
of production employed in the export industries

01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:49.440
are profiting from the dispersal of

01:35:49.450 --> 01:35:50.880
international trade.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.140
The next benefit is the

01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:59.500
restructuring of the economy and

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:02.580
in this case there will be a redistribution

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.580
of production factors in

01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:07.200
favor of more efficient sectors

01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:11.720
of the economy, and redistribute

01:36:11.730 --> 01:36:14.580
in favor of owners of

01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:15.560
production factors,

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:17.660
adequately, effectively

01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:19.580
organizing their economic

01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:21.460
process, their activities.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.540
The third factor is the growth of employment.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.960
First of all, of course, this is the growth

01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:28.880
of employment in export industries, but

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:30.600
on the other hand, you and I have already

01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:33.680
found out that the image of the WTO member

01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:37.360
countries is increasing, and this increases

01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:40.340
the stability of the image of

01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:42.600
this national economy, increases the

01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:43.900
expectation of transparency,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.240
adequacy of foreign economic policy

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.820
of this country.

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.800
Thus, the influx of investment will

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:55.060
increase, and consequently, additional

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.800
are created, on the other hand,

01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:04.340
in this case there is a negative

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:06.160
factor.

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:10.280
If investments do not come to

01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.880
the import substitution sector, then

01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:18.760
it is possible that the subsectors

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:20.900
of the import substitution sector

01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:22.240
will not withstand international

01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.600
competition, and then in

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:26.200
this area there will be

01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:30.900
a reduction in employment and

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:33.920
job cuts, a fall in income.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.960
Then it will be the time

01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:39.800
for government intervention in these

01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:40.760
problems.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.680
The problem of structural support

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:50.880
for less protected industries is the task

01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:53.880
of the state and the task of preserving

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:55.520
certain economic and foreign

01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:57.180
trade barriers for the transitional

01:37:57.190 --> 01:37:58.140
period.

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:03.200
The next factor of benefits is the increase

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:06.200
in the efficiency of foreign economic activity.

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:09.180
In particular, it is assumed that

01:38:09.190 --> 01:38:11.720
if a country moves to develop

01:38:11.730 --> 01:38:12.660
such foreign economic

01:38:12.670 --> 01:38:13.680
legislation, even

01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:15.220
in the process of preparation

01:38:15.230 --> 01:38:17.400
for entry into the World Trade

01:38:17.410 --> 01:38:19.100
Organization, which more or

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.000
less meets the standard

01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:22.840
requirements of the World

01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:24.020
Trade Organization, if it

01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.920
unifies its legislation under

01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:28.000
the requirements, then

01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:31.820
the work of foreign trade

01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:33.920
various controlling

01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:35.520
organizations, including

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.660
customs, becomes more

01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:38.620
adequate.

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.280
And so-called transaction

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:43.200
costs or costs associated

01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:45.220
with corruption of officials

01:38:45.230 --> 01:38:46.840
are reduced.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.240
This gives companies the next advantage

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:55.140
– protection against lobbying.

01:38:55.150 --> 01:38:58.080
Because transparent policy implies

01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:01.260
that such a system is developed

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:03.760
in legislation that does not force

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.060
a double interpretation of

01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:11.060
one or another position of the law.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.400
Moreover, this transparent law

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:19.720
implies that it decides how

01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:26.540
to act on some economic agent,

01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:29.980
our exporter, not a official.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.680
It does not depend on his

01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:33.240
subjective decision.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.620
And laws in a certain degree foreign

01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:37.700
trade have the principle of

01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:39.300
automatic decision.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.540
This is why the demands of

01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:45.700
various large financial and

01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:47.920
industrial groups or some other

01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:49.520
structures that try to

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:51.540
lobby for the protection

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:53.780
of their group interests

01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:55.580
are reduced.

01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.100
An example of lobbying in

01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:59.760
the Russian market is, of course,

01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:01.880
our automotive industry and agricultural

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:02.900
producers, as well

01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:05.520
as the financial sector of

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:06.560
the economy.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.700
In this regard, corruption problems

01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:13.640
are closely linked to lobbying,

01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:17.540
since the framework between

01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:20.360
lobbying and demanding

01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:22.720
such a quota rent is

01:40:22.730 --> 01:40:26.680
often blurred.

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:34.480
Quota rent in this license for external

01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:36.020
economic activity or determine the

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:38.340
size of quotas, it is possible

01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:41.960
that they require their rent,

01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:45.040
their fee for making such

01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:46.020
a decision.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.260
If the foreign trade law becomes

01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:52.020
more transparent and the mechanism

01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:53.740
of its operation becomes more

01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:56.340
automatic, then, of course, the possibility

01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.460
of receiving such quota rent

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:00.500
decreases.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.300
The next benefit for the country’

01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:07.400
s economy as a whole is

01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:10.260
safety and standardization

01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:12.240
of products.

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:14.300
Of course, I have already said

01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:16.660
that often on some kind of

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.260
products standards of Russia

01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:20.480
are quite high, but on the other

01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:22.860
hand we can make, so to speak,

01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:24.540
a whole list, a whole list

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:26.400
of some other types of products,

01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:28.580
standards, which are quite

01:41:28.590 --> 01:41:29.720
unknown.

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.400
And here, in general, again, again, we

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.960
should not go far for the example.

01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.720
Take the emission standards

01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:37.520
of our automobile

01:41:37.530 --> 01:41:40.180
production, cars, some trucks,

01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:41.800
this is the whole cargo

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:43.040
fleet.

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.800
In Europe, the standard is already in

01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:48.880
effect beyond Euro 3, and accordingly,

01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:51.540
the Russian, so to speak, Euro 4 has already

01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:54.440
been adopted, and Russian cars are

01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:57.620
still being made under the old type of standard.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.300
Accordingly, such externalities

01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:02.500
or rebel effects from the activities

01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:05.380
of the Russian automotive industry

01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:08.020
are experienced by many cities.

01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.080
And, accordingly, this is the

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:11.540
national problem as ecology,

01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:14.900
it can somehow move towards

01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:16.720
its solution precisely because

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.320
of the fact that Russia will

01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:20.280
join the WTO and, accordingly,

01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:22.300
will enjoy certain security

01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:24.300
standards that are accepted

01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:26.220
in the entire civilized world.

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:31.480
Another important overall benefit

01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:33.460
of Russia’s accession to the

01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:36.980
WTO is a more stable political

01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:39.100
situation.

01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:43.060
After all, if conflicts related to

01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:51.280
the flow of goods and these problems

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.960
do not accumulate, some positions do

01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:59.200
not heat up, and the possibility of

01:42:59.210 --> 01:43:01.060
a solution, a peaceful solution

01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:02.700
leads to the fact that

01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:04.120
the political situation in

01:43:04.130 --> 01:43:06.140
the relations between countries

01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:08.040
becomes more stable.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.440
Of course, such a conclusion or investigation

01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:14.300
is not necessary.

01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.800
Why is?

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.600
Because I said before, when you and

01:43:16.610 --> 01:43:20.000
I discussed the introduction

01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.100
of economic sanctions, that,

01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:23.640
for example, economic sanctions

01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:26.080
are often the result of political

01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:27.560
struggle.

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.980
And they themselves do not

01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:33.200
reflect any trade disputes.

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:36.940
They are most likely just a weapon

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:38.560
in the hands of politicians

01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:41.000
to punish one side or the other.

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:45.480
But, nevertheless, if we do not take

01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:48.080
the options of introducing an embargo

01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:51.200
or such restrictions, then, in

01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:53.400
general, if there is a mechanism

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:55.480
for coordinating common decisions

01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:57.480
within the WTO, then

01:43:57.490 --> 01:44:00.420
the political situation without

01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:02.520
any major economic problems becomes

01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:05.000
more transparent and more

01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:07.900
stable, without major crisis

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:09.820
situations.

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.540
The overall benefits of Russia’s accession

01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:15.780
to the World Trade Organization are

01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:17.720
not only related to Russia itself.

01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.080
Per that is why the WTO

01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:21.700
members agree to move the

01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:24.580
talks, because if these countries

01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:28.640
were not interested in Russia’

01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:31.120
s accession to the WTO, they

01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.700
would probably have countered

01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:36.420
it in every way.

01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.960
Therefore, the other side of the countries

01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:40.960
and members are also interested

01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:43.620
in getting access to a sufficiently

01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:45.700
large Russian market.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.720
Therefore, the relationship between

01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:50.020
countries is settled by

01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:52.200
ensuring, first of all, equal opportunities

01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:55.680
for all members, including for

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.060
small countries, which, probably,

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:01.060
if they were to speak separately

01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:03.560
in negotiations with such a

01:45:03.570 --> 01:45:06.760
giant as Russia,, would often

01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:08.200
have less chances for

01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:11.240
defending their interests.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.880
The common benefit, again, is an

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.380
effective dispute resolution

01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:19.000
mechanism, a failure to take unilateral

01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:21.220
action, which ultimately these

01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:22.800
unilateral actions usually lead

01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:24.500
to a banal trade war, when

01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:27.480
both sides start to impose counter-

01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:30.000
tariffs, quotas and restrictions,

01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:31.520
and ultimately suffer

01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:33.720
both the producer and consumer,

01:45:33.730 --> 01:45:36.560
and the countries that

01:45:36.570 --> 01:45:39.180
started the trade bath,

01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:41.500
and the country that

01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:43.340
is taking only retaliatory

01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:44.520
measures.

01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:47.660
The next benefit, of course,

01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.400
normal development, stable development

01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:54.600
of economic relations will reduce

01:45:54.610 --> 01:45:57.760
the risks, for example, trade, international

01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:59.460
trade crises, international financial

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.980
crisis, and in the end

01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:04.220
all this strengthens international

01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:06.040
stability and pushes

01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:08.580
away the possibility

01:46:08.590 --> 01:46:10.960
of such an abnormal

01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:13.620
situation as the world economic

01:46:13.630 --> 01:46:15.340
crisis.

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:18.960
Lastly, we will emphasize once again

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:22.040
that in this case, the risk of political

01:46:22.050 --> 01:46:25.860
conflicts is reduced for all countries.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.200
What is the history of negotiations

01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:31.160
on Russia’s accession to the

01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:33.140
World Trade Organization?

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.080
In 1993, Russia filed an application

01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:40.580
for accession to the

01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:42.780
then-existent tariff and

01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:44.400
trade agreement.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.920
And then, by the decision of the

01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:49.400
GAD, a working group on accession was created.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.980
The first thing that this working

01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.280
group did was to study the Russian

01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:57.300
trade regime and to elaborate

01:46:57.310 --> 01:47:00.400
those questions, problems, these

01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:02.200
requirements that Russia had

01:47:02.210 --> 01:47:04.920
to fulfill in the framework

01:47:04.930 --> 01:47:06.020
of adjusting its

01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:08.720
foreign trade regulation legislation.

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.680
The 93th year is still a rather difficult

01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:13.680
year in the development of Russia itself.

01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.720
Therefore, of course, in the first

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:19.880
stages up to the 95th year,

01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:23.420
there was no real negotiation

01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:25.540
process, only some conditions

01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:27.360
for further decisions

01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:28.560
were developed.

01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:31.180
As I said before, since Russia primarily

01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:33.740
trade with the European Union, it

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.960
is the representatives of the European

01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:40.440
Union that were entrusted with the

01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:43.840
preparation of these very requirements

01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:46.700
and conditions for Russia’

01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:48.360
s accession to the WTO.

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:54.640
Only in 1998 began the initial

01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:58.040
offers on access to the market

01:47:58.050 --> 01:48:03.000
of goods and services and on the

01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:06.500
level of support for agriculture,

01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:12.460
from Russia and member countries.

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:15.040


01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:19.240
These initial proposals were

01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:21.080
adjusted for quite a while,

01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:23.320
almost for two years, and in

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.800
fact only from the beginning of

01:48:25.810 --> 01:48:28.020
the new millennium in 2000 all aspects

01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:30.860
of Russia’s joining the

01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:33.300
World Trade Organization

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.380
were burstingly discussed,

01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:39.800
not just the problems related

01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:42.880
to the GAD and GAC agreement.

01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:44.100


01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.280
The current working group, which

01:48:46.290 --> 01:48:49.460
conducts, analyzes, makes decisions,

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.160
analyses the problems related to

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.500
Russia’s accession to the WTO, is

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:54.820
in a state of affairs.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.680
First of all, the requirements, as

01:48:58.690 --> 01:49:00.540
in the WTO, standard requirements

01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:02.980
for all potential WTO members.

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:04.780
This group includes, of course, not

01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:07.680
all 150 countries, not representatives

01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:12.020
of not all 150 countries in the world,

01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:14.260
namely those countries that maintain

01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:16.400
the closest foreign trade relations

01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:19.180
with a potential member, and precisely

01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:23.100
those countries that, so to speak,

01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:26.020
have some unconsensual issues

01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:32.560
in this very foreign trade.

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.800
By the end of 2006, the Working

01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:42.020
Group had 58 member countries.

01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:43.300


01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:46.020
At the same time, note, the European

01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:49.420
Union was a single bloc and

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:51.800
considered as one country, so 58

01:49:51.810 --> 01:49:54.460
countries are a large enough group

01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:56.140
of countries, which include not

01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:57.840
only developed, but also developing

01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:00.000
countries, which are interested

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:02.120
in the Russian market or in importing

01:50:02.130 --> 01:50:07.140
Russian products or from

01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:09.120
Russian territory.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:13.020
In early 2007, Vietnam

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:14.680
and Cambodia joined

01:50:14.690 --> 01:50:16.920
the negotiations.

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.300
What could this be related to?

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.940
First, Vietnam and Cambodia

01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:24.820
are large agricultural

01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:27.140
producers.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.960
On the other hand, Vietnam has

01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:32.500
recently tried to intercept the world

01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:36.060
factory squad from China.

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.980
That is, on the territory of Vietnam,

01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:39.300
export-oriented

01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.900
production of enough

01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:48.620
clothing is organized, with the

01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:52.720
assembly of some final consumption goods.

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.880
They joined the negotiation

01:50:55.890 --> 01:50:58.100
process in 2007 because

01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.940
the barrier issues to agricultural

01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:03.480
products are being

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:05.340
resolved right now.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.100
The number of working groups

01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:10.500
that are working on

01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:13.020
Russia’s accession to

01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:16.000
the WTO is now 50 members.

01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:18.120


01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.400
These are 50 member countries,

01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:26.080
which are the countries that are

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.260
primarily interested in regulating

01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:31.500
trade issues.

01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.680
In terms of access to

01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:36.380
the Russian market, the group

01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:38.300
has about 30 members.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:44.240
If we summarize the situation

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.240
of the negotiation process

01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:50.080
now, we can highlight the

01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:52.720
following elements of this

01:51:52.730 --> 01:51:54.680
negotiation process, which

01:51:54.690 --> 01:51:56.960
took place in 2007.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.600
First of all, it is currently determined

01:52:00.610 --> 01:52:03.040
the level of binding of

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.460
the rates of roaming duties on

01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:07.860
Russian territory.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.480
What is the level of connection?

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.920
It is defined by different commodity

01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:13.260
groups.

01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:15.860
The maximum interest rate

01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:19.400
that will beined after Russia

01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:20.980
joins the World

01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:22.980
Trade Organization.

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.640
So, fortunately, this process is basically

01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:28.600
completed with all the members of the

01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:30.740
working group.

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.100
They agreed that the initial level

01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:35.660
of bonding of customs duties

01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:39.840
would not be lower than the current level.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.280
In the first year,

01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:44.100
no tariffs will be

01:52:44.110 --> 01:52:45.060
reduced.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.880
The level of customs protection

01:52:47.890 --> 01:52:50.120
of agriculture will not decrease,

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.960
and in a number of positions

01:52:53.970 --> 01:52:56.420
Russia even has the right to raise

01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:59.300
the tariffs a bit in this very

01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:02.840
transitional period until 2009.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:08.780
In 2009, the right to use tariff

01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:12.180
quotas for three types of meat was

01:53:12.190 --> 01:53:14.360
recorded - beef, pork and poultry

01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:15.320
meat.

01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:20.900
The technology for determining these

01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:23.700
quotas is the current level of quotas

01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:26.820
plus two and a half expansions

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.900
of quotas depending on the annual

01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:35.000
growth of the supply of

01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:39.180
meat production on Russian territory.

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.800
You know that 2006-2007 was marked by

01:53:43.810 --> 01:53:48.020
quite bitter disputes of the European Union,

01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:50.640
in particular Poland, over the embargo

01:53:50.650 --> 01:53:52.920
on the import of meat from the

01:53:52.930 --> 01:53:56.580
territory of the European Union, and

01:53:56.590 --> 01:53:58.680
not only from the territory of

01:53:58.690 --> 01:54:00.280
Poland, but this list includes

01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:02.060
a number of countries.

01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:06.320
It is because of the fact that, in the opinion

01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:07.900
of the Russian country, certain

01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:10.580
technical, so to speak, medical

01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:14.120
standards have been violated.

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.900
In the future, as you can see, Russia

01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:21.020
has at least at this stage of negotiations

01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:23.840
obtained the right to maintain

01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:25.440
such protectionist

01:54:25.450 --> 01:54:28.100
measures with regard to meat

01:54:28.110 --> 01:54:30.240
imports.

01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:38.110
And in general, for example, the substantial

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:39.670
direction of the negotiations,

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.290
the negotiations on agricultural issues

01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:45.410
came to the fact that in general, the

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:49.530
position of Russia has not yet been

01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:52.250
recognized, the parties do not

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.170
agree to accept the demand or

01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:57.810
the offer that Russia made for negotiations.

01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:58.670


01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:02.250
Russia proposes to fix the amount

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.130
of support for our agriculture

01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:12.910
for the period 1993-1995.

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:18.410
The amount of support will

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:23.830
be $9.5 billion a year, but it

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.970
would seem that this is not

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:28.870
as much as the EU’s investments

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:35.330
in its negotiating countries

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.890
as the normal level of

01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:40.990
protectionist

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.670
protection in the form

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.450
of state subsidies

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:48.230
for agriculture, export

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.070
or national production economy.

01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:57.030
Moreover, the allowed amount of domestic

01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:00.670
state support of the agricultural sector,

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.770
it does not, of course, apply to

01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:05.350
all types of agricultural products,

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.330
but only to a certain list of the

01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:09.690
so-called yellow basket.

01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:12.170
This list includes agricultural

01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:12.990
products for which

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.130
the World Trade Organization

01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:18.270
demands a reduction

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.770
in protectionism.

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.670


01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.640
The next block is the

01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:30.560
access to the service market.

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.260
This is primarily financial

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:38.620
services and energy

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:40.740
services.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.140
And in this respect, of course, the

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.280
struggle is due to the fact that

01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:51.520
restricting access to the service market

01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:55.900
is lobbied by our financial groups.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:59.160
And they prove that access to the

01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:00.920
financial market, which is not

01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.040
yet so sustainable, they think

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.980
should be limited.

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:06.500
Consequently, these problems

01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:09.700
are being solved during the negotiations.

01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:10.460


01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.720
The next sector is not only

01:57:13.730 --> 01:57:15.760
financial, but also energy.

01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:19.720
And here India advocates for access

01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:21.920
to individuals.

01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.600
India, Canada and Switzerland

01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:26.540
are advocating for individuals’ access

01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:30.760
to the Russian market

01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:33.120
in certain sectors of financial and

01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:35.380
energy services.

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.180
In principle, the negotiators concluded

01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:41.440
that Russia agreed to open

01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:45.200
115 services sectors out of

01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:49.080
the 150 sectors listed by

01:57:49.090 --> 01:57:53.000
the World Trade Organization.

01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.980
But it puts forward requirements

01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.860
that involve tightening the working

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:03.600
conditions of foreign service

01:58:03.610 --> 01:58:08.140
providers in the Russian market.

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.260
And the next block, the last block,

01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:15.340
concerning the negotiation process,

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.820
is negotiations on systemic issues.

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.320
This is primarily

01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:21.040
the Russian law.

01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.500
Three blocks of questions are raised.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.540
The first.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.800
The Russian legislation, the

01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:31.840
requirements of the WTO in the field

01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:34.240
of application of sanitary and phytosanitary

01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.680
measures.

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.840
Mostly, we have raised these questions

01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:39.700
with you already.

01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.060
This includes not only the various

01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.200
tariff quotas for meat, but also,

01:58:44.210 --> 01:58:46.960
as the WTO working group believes,

01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:49.340
excessive requirements for alcohol

01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:52.160
and pharmaceuticals.

01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.440
As you understand, the country that is being

01:58:54.450 --> 01:58:55.960
targeted is Georgia, and

01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:58.560
the country that is interested is India.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.300
The next direction is the use

01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:09.000
of some elements of state

01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:10.040
regulation in the sphere

01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:11.640
of foreign economic

01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:13.760
activity, which, again, does

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.560
not meet the requirements

01:59:15.570 --> 01:59:17.280
and standards of the

01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:19.500
World Trade Organization.

01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.940
The last block of requirements on

01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:24.060
systemic issues of change of the

01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:28.220
legal system of Russia is called the WTO+.

01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:30.360
In principle, of course, Russia may

01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:31.680
not pay attention to them because

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:34.520
they are not within the jurisdiction

01:59:34.530 --> 01:59:37.960
of the World Trade Organization.

01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:40.240
They are related to government procurement

01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:43.000
of civil aviation equipment.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.940
However, in order to eliminate possible

01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:48.740
conflicts and subsequent problems

01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:49.840
with the situation in foreign

01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:52.040
trade flows, these negotiations

01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:55.020
also take place.

01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:58.360
What other requirements do WTO member

01:59:58.370 --> 02:00:00.340
countries make to Russia in the

02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:02.860
framework of mutual agreements?

02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:05.380
This is the abolition of national

02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:07.680
components of investment projects.

02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:11.460
For now, it was assumed that when

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:15.060
direct investments are made

02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:19.440
in the Russian market,

02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:22.100
the property belonging to

02:00:22.110 --> 02:00:23.780
domestic producers, the same

02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:25.500
national component, should

02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:27.480
also be included in this

02:00:27.490 --> 02:00:28.840
investment process.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.220
The next requirement is to ensure

02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:33.860
compliance with the requirements

02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:35.540
of the WTO, the applicable tariff

02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:37.400
quotas.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.040
This applies to agricultural

02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:41.140
agreements.

02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:44.600
This requirement involves

02:00:44.610 --> 02:00:45.960
such agreements that

02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:47.600
reduce their use.

02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.940
The next requirement is

02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:53.940
the organization of transactions

02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:55.220
of sale by state trade enterprises

02:00:55.230 --> 02:00:59.680
on a measureable basis.

02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.460
And the most important requirement is not

02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:06.200
to discriminate against foreign companies in participating

02:01:06.210 --> 02:01:08.640
in these transactions.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.820
This component is due to the

02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:13.980
fact that in the developed

02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:15.820
countries, the state

02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:18.500
primarily distributes

02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:22.680
state orders among domestic producers.

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.020
But within the framework of these

02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:28.160
negotiations it is assumed that a consensus

02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:30.380
will be developed on the video,

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:32.920
which will allow foreign companies

02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:34.960
to participate in more

02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:37.300
in government procurement

02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:39.400
programs.

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.600
And the last essential

02:01:41.610 --> 02:01:43.000
requirement, put forward

02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:44.540
by the participants of the World

02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:46.820
Trade Organization, is the question

02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:52.660
of dual education on energy

02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.420
developed hard position,

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:59.200
showing that we all, however,

02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:01.160
our energy goods, energy

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:04.400
donors in certain volumes

02:02:04.410 --> 02:02:06.820
and at certain stable

02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.680
prices must first of all

02:02:08.690 --> 02:02:11.160
provide national demand

02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:13.640
of national producers.

02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:17.260
Now we will consider the last question

02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:20.420
of our lecture, concerning

02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:23.360
the readiness of the Russian

02:02:23.370 --> 02:02:24.820
market of Russian producers

02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:26.500
to join the WTO.

02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:29.180
On the one hand, Russian producers

02:02:29.190 --> 02:02:31.540
were protected from foreign flow of

02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:35.420
goods and services at the expense

02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:38.460
of the currency component almost

02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:42.980
in the period after the 1998 crisis.

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.220
We have been aware of the situation

02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:47.620
in international economic relations

02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:50.360
where the exchange rate

02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:51.880
can act as a protectionist

02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:53.580
barrier.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.760
If the ruble is weak enough,

02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:58.260
it means that you can buy a

02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.400
smaller amount of dollars

02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:03.480
or euros for this ruble and,

02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:07.060
accordingly, a smaller

02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:10.000
amount of goods for imports.

02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:16.920
By 2001, the protectionism

02:03:16.930 --> 02:03:20.720
was exhausted.

02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:22.940
From this point of view, starting from

02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:25.420
2001, pay attention to the scheme, the

02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:26.480
schedule.

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.640
The Russian manufacturer is in

02:03:31.650 --> 02:03:35.660
a situation of normal competitiveness.

02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:39.420
And the competition of imports from

02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:41.640
far abroad in this case has increased.

02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.360
This is not a new revelation

02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:45.840
for the Russian manufacturers.

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.600
The Russian ruble is stillining

02:03:50.610 --> 02:03:52.700
stability and a certain

02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:56.380
pace of growth.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.800
This is all dependent on the

02:03:58.810 --> 02:04:01.020
central bank’s monetary policy.

02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.880
To what extent the central bank will decide

02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.940
it is acceptable for the Russian economy

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:09.820
to deliberately intervene to reduce

02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:12.040
the currency rate of the ruble.

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:15.620
Such an automatic mechanism,

02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:19.540
which was associated with

02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:22.500
a weak national ruble, is

02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:24.920
now exhausted.

02:04:24.930 --> 02:04:28.240
For the past five to six years, Russian

02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:31.620
manufacturers have been forced

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:34.020
to take this into account.

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.500
Russia’s tariffs on imports of

02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:41.480
agricultural products.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.740
In general, despite the fact

02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:48.680
that countries in the Conciliation

02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:53.120
Group demand some protectionist

02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:55.020
restrictions on agriculture,

02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:58.640
our tariffs are quite comparable

02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:00.540
to the restrictions

02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:03.380
currently in force in the territory

02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:05.540
of developed and developing

02:05:05.550 --> 02:05:07.520
countries.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.680
In developing countries,

02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:13.600
tariffs on agricultural

02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:15.260
imports are almost

02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:20.180
19%, and in such a large

02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:23.280
export economy as

02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:26.920
China, even 40%.

02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:29.880
In countries with transitional economies,

02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:33.160
this percentage is quite high and

02:05:33.170 --> 02:05:36.840
reaches about 16%.

02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:40.420
In developed countries, the level

02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:42.960
of protection of the national

02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:43.680
agricultural market

02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:46.060
is strong enough and, as you know,

02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:48.000
this is the main problem in negotiations

02:05:48.010 --> 02:05:49.800
between the EU and the United

02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:51.600
States, negotiations between

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:54.580
the EU and developing countries.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:56.960
The EU has raised

02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:59.080
the protectionist protection

02:05:59.090 --> 02:06:01.620
in agriculture

02:06:01.630 --> 02:06:05.320
to 43.4%.

02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:08.080
In other words, there is a prohibitive

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:11.440
level of tariffs.

02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:15.360
And based on these figures, we

02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:17.300
can say that our domestic agriculture

02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:19.080
and agricultural producers

02:06:19.090 --> 02:06:20.680
already operate within the framework

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:23.080
of a sufficiently liberalized

02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:24.940
market for agricultural

02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:26.560
products.

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:28.880
Therefore, the entry into

02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:30.560
the WTO whileining this

02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:32.980
level of protection for a transitional

02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:34.740
period, and even a decrease

02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:36.980
at a certain stage of this

02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:40.240
level, will not bring

02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:42.000
some unexpected outcome

02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:44.140
for agricultural producers.

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:46.560
Pay attention to the slide,

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.540
which illustrates the actual level

02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:52.160
of the import tariff.

02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:55.760
If we consider that the so-called

02:06:55.770 --> 02:06:58.460
weighted average rate of the import

02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:59.960
tariff is usually calculated in

02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:01.740
international debates and calculations,

02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:04.740
then by 2000, gradually decreasing,

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.520
it reached an average of 2.5% in

02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:09.020
our country.

02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:11.480
Of course, this average is quite

02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:14.280
conditional, because it is calculated

02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:16.280
as a kind of average temperature

02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:17.940
for the hospital.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.680
One has a high temperature,

02:07:20.690 --> 02:07:22.860
the other is already

02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:24.080
cold.

02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:26.660
So, the weighted average rate

02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:28.560
is, I repeat again, now

02:07:28.570 --> 02:07:31.020
already by 2000, and now is

02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:34.500
still slightly below 12.5%.

02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:36.440
But an effective import

02:07:36.450 --> 02:07:38.660
tariff rate implies that we

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:43.680
also take into account the shadow

02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:46.840
economy flows and other negative

02:07:46.850 --> 02:07:49.500
factors that lower the

02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:53.220
protectionist protection of

02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:55.600
the existing tariff.

02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:58.180
In this case, the

02:07:58.190 --> 02:08:00.300
effective rate of the import

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:02.520
tariff is only about

02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:04.800
9%.

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:08.560
Thus, the Russian market has already

02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:12.380
become accustomed to working in fairly

02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:14.360
tough conditions of competitive struggle

02:08:14.370 --> 02:08:16.080
with imports.

02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:20.300
The Russian proposals from the

02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:21.540
Russian delegation at

02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:25.500
the talks include expanding the

02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:29.280
corridor of protectionist rates

02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:31.140
and fixing the initial and

02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:33.680
final level of the related tariff

02:08:33.690 --> 02:08:35.220
bond, i.e. the upper and lower

02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:37.320
limit of the tariff,

02:08:37.330 --> 02:08:40.300
on industrial goods at the level

02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:47.020
of 14.3% to 9.8%, against

02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:52.780
the real level of 9.7% of the

02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:54.960
average tariff.

02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:00.640
What are the real factors

02:09:00.650 --> 02:09:02.600
of open economy?

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.900
Of course, these are factors

02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:08.100
that are contrary to the normal

02:09:08.110 --> 02:09:10.580
operation of economic policy that

02:09:10.590 --> 02:09:14.820
is developed and in line with our legislation.

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:20.200
First, on the one hand, these

02:09:20.210 --> 02:09:22.980
are such negative factors as

02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:26.000
the existence of gray schemes,

02:09:26.010 --> 02:09:28.980
when goods produced and

02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:30.940
designed for lower income

02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:32.360
of the population, oriented

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.880
to some third developing countries,

02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:35.760
fall on the Russian

02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:36.780
market.

02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:39.220
Accordingly, they are essentially

02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:41.040
sold and offered under dumping

02:09:41.050 --> 02:09:45.020
schemes in relation to our goods.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.480
On the other hand, importers have

02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:50.460
serious schemes of tax optimization,

02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:52.840
which also lowers the price

02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:56.400
level of imported goods.

02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.260
The last negative component is the

02:09:59.270 --> 02:10:02.980
boat imports, which have recently

02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:04.060
been somewhat reduced, as

02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:08.180
competition in the Russian market,

02:10:08.190 --> 02:10:10.740
the growth of Russian population's

02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:15.100
income and the increase in the

02:10:15.110 --> 02:10:17.620
level of product quality requirements

02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:19.680
lead to the fact that gradually

02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:21.400
boat imports are collapsing

02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:23.700
and becoming more organized

02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:25.980
at the level of small and

02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:28.200
medium-sized importers.

02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:30.760
The next factor, which is no longer related

02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:32.320
to the shadow economy and is in principle

02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:34.880
subject to possible regulation by

02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:36.060
the government in the person

02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:38.700
of the Central Bank, is the rise

02:10:38.710 --> 02:10:40.380
of the ruble.

02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:43.400
As I said, a stronger and more stable

02:10:43.410 --> 02:10:45.540
ruble, but with a tendency

02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:47.720
to rise, usually restricts

02:10:47.730 --> 02:10:50.560
exports and increases imports.

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.960
This factor has been working

02:10:54.970 --> 02:10:57.720
for a year, at least since

02:10:57.730 --> 02:10:59.380
2002.

02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:02.520
Russian manufacturers

02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:04.660
have also been used

02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:07.440
to this.

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.060
According to the calculation

02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:21.620
of independent organizations, for

02:11:21.630 --> 02:11:24.740
six months of 2006 gray

02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:26.960
imports were quite serious,

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.340
reaching $ 18 billion.

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:40.440
However, this type of imports

02:11:40.450 --> 02:11:45.340
may decrease.

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:45.740
Why is?

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.920
Because if in 2005 the gray circuits

02:11:48.930 --> 02:11:52.480
covered a large range of products,

02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:54.340
the development of modern legislation

02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:56.500
and its adaptation to the

02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:58.280
WTO rules leads to the fact

02:11:58.290 --> 02:11:59.840
that gray imports are slightly

02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:05.420
reduced from 47% to 32%.

02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:07.940
The central bank, however, has

02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:12.200
lower figures, twice as low.

02:12:12.210 --> 02:12:15.000
But in this case, we will consider that

02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:16.600
the truth is somewhere in the middle

02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:18.600
between the expert assessment

02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:20.840
of specialists and the calculations

02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:21.940
of the Central Bank.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.740
Well, the last thing I would like to

02:12:24.750 --> 02:12:27.920
draw your attention to is that based

02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:31.200
on the previous slide scheme, we have

02:12:31.210 --> 02:12:33.620
in general already developed and introduced

02:12:33.630 --> 02:12:38.140
a fairly low level of average tariff

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:40.080
in the Russian economy for a number

02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:41.860
of years, which covers

02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:44.800
about 50% of the products.

02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:52.380
Thus, we have solved the urgent and important

02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:55.540
problems related to Russia’s

02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:57.480
accession to the WTO.
