00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
Now I would like you to consolidate your knowledge on a practical example.

00:12.400 --> 00:22.640
If you remember, we discussed Thomas Gedde's approach and his two concepts,

00:22.640 --> 00:26.960
the thinking field of the brand and brand code.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.600
What would I like to recommend to you?

00:29.680 --> 00:38.240
Let each of you take this technology as a basis and now imagine a brand of your own company.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.160
If it is created, take the one that is created.

00:42.160 --> 00:58.240
If it is not yet, imagine that you are the creator of this brand and try to write the thinking field and brand code according to the technology and the tool that Thomas Gedde proposed.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.360
But I would like you to add this section.

01:03.360 --> 01:12.480
Try to create a portrait of your brand as a person.

01:12.480 --> 01:26.240
Why? Because we always try to associate ourselves with living beings, like people.

01:26.320 --> 01:35.680
It is not by chance that many brands, not only sports brands, use specific animals, faces, etc.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.040
So try to imagine yourself.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.480
If your brand, your brand, is to be imagined as a person, then who would he be?

01:44.480 --> 01:49.120
Gender, age, hair color, social status, behavior, etc.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.560
Why is this done?

01:50.640 --> 01:56.880
You have to draw what you would like me, as your consumer, to see.

01:56.880 --> 02:02.080
Then, when you conduct a focus group and testing, you will be able to compare and understand.

02:02.080 --> 02:09.440
And the target audience that you planned for, they also see your brand.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.440
This is a method of adjustment.

02:13.520 --> 02:20.480
So, colleagues, when you imagine yourself as a person, as a brand person,

02:20.480 --> 02:24.640
you will always be able to see how your consumer perceives it.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.480
You will have the opportunity to adjust your advertising campaign.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.480
Or you will have to learn what you have not noticed.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.480
Or, on the contrary, you will have to form what you would like to form.

02:36.480 --> 02:41.440
Well, on this, colleagues, let's finish our course.

02:41.520 --> 02:49.520
And as a general wish to all of you, people who are engaged in such creative activity,

02:49.520 --> 02:53.920
we sometimes use such an old advertising slogan, we say,

02:53.920 --> 02:56.640
to people doomed to be creative,

02:56.640 --> 03:03.680
let me, as a general wish, quote you a wonderful poem by the English poet William Blake.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.520
In one moment to see eternity,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.000
A huge world in the grain of sand,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.720
In a single handful of infinity,

03:12.720 --> 03:15.040
And the sky in a cup of flowers.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.520
Good luck to you, colleagues, on this very difficult task.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.720
Thank you.

03:20.720 --> 03:26.160
Colleagues, in this section of our today's course,

03:26.160 --> 03:29.600
I would like to present you a selection of works,

03:30.560 --> 03:35.360
namely, the advertising of famous Russian and foreign brands,

03:35.360 --> 03:38.560
so that you get acquainted with the examples and techniques

03:38.560 --> 03:42.400
that they use in their advertising practice.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.520
But I would like you to not only get acquainted with the examples

03:47.520 --> 03:49.520
that are given here in the section,

03:49.520 --> 03:53.200
you also turned to the workbook, to the first task.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.960
The purpose of the task is as follows.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.320
From the video series you are offered,

03:58.320 --> 04:01.360
you choose as many as you consider necessary,

04:01.360 --> 04:04.880
preferably at least two or three advertising works,

04:04.880 --> 04:10.480
and try to evaluate these works in accordance with the proposed technique.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.080
We have criteria there, there is a bias assessment.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.080
This is the first part of the work.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.560
The second part of the work is that

04:18.560 --> 04:23.360
you will have to try to modify

04:23.360 --> 04:28.320
or offer to modify the solutions proposed to you for review.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.680
Most importantly, when you try to do the second part,

04:31.680 --> 04:33.920
namely, modify the proposed solution,

04:33.920 --> 04:40.000
please do not do any kind of re-processing of this approach.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.560
The approach should remain as it is accepted by the customer.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.920
I present to you in the selection of advertising works

04:47.920 --> 04:51.680
already accepted, known and, say, used.

04:51.840 --> 04:58.000
Therefore, the customers who were for the advertising agency,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
they are rated as positive.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.640
Therefore, in the second part of the practical work,

05:02.640 --> 05:06.240
just try to think what you would offer to improve,

05:06.240 --> 05:09.280
or correct, or change the text,

05:09.280 --> 05:10.880
maybe something in color, and so on,

05:10.880 --> 05:15.200
but remaining within the content that is here.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.600
That is, no principled revolution,

05:17.600 --> 05:19.200
remove everything, remove it.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.320
Try to avoid these proposals.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.280
Well, let's then, after you understand

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
what is the meaning of our today's block,

05:27.280 --> 05:31.040
let's look at the works that I have selected for you.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.560
Of course, colleagues, this is not all the best that is.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.320
Surely, you can give more vivid examples,

05:38.320 --> 05:42.080
but from the point of view of the solutions,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.480
they seemed to us the most interesting.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.960
In the first slide, we see

05:46.960 --> 05:50.880
an advertisement for a cleaning tool for black clothes.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.880
Why did we include this slide?

05:52.880 --> 05:54.880
Look how simple and concise

05:54.880 --> 05:57.520
from the point of view of technology this slide is solved.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.520
Nothing staged, right?

05:59.520 --> 06:02.400
You see a hanger and see the straps

06:02.400 --> 06:05.200
from some evening dress, most likely.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
If the clothes are black,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.440
then naturally, and it is perfectly black,

06:09.440 --> 06:10.640
that is, perfectly clean,

06:10.640 --> 06:14.080
then you could not see anything else, of course.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.720
The next slide is such an untraditional

06:16.720 --> 06:18.720
ad for Ariel.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.960
Well, I think that you all know this tool,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
the advertising campaign that is held

06:22.960 --> 06:25.680
for this tool is constantly in the air.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.560
But look how interesting this topic is solved.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.560
Also no staging slides,

06:30.560 --> 06:33.680
no stars, great actors, etc.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.680
Just such a...

06:35.680 --> 06:39.280
Remember how we talked about the basic techniques?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.320
Humor and games.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.320
Just such a good, good, light humor,

06:44.320 --> 06:46.320
some small irony.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.320
T-shirt before, T-shirt after using Ariel.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.520
Another cleaning tool.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.800
Pay attention to the famous Che Guevara image.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.160
Today, many people use it.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.360
But look, because the clothes are so soft

07:03.360 --> 07:08.000
and so tender, Che Guevara fell asleep on the girl's T-shirt.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.560
That is, he is so good, he is so comfortable.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.280
Here, two topics are very competently played out.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.840
And the softness of the powder itself,

07:15.840 --> 07:17.840
which allows you to make the material like this.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.320
And some kind of erotic theme,

07:20.320 --> 07:24.160
because he falls asleep on the chest of a young girl.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.960
This solution that you see here

07:26.960 --> 07:28.960
for a cream for shoes, in my opinion,

07:28.960 --> 07:31.760
is very clever, very competent

07:31.760 --> 07:33.200
and very professional.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.480
Look, what is written in the advertising slogan

07:36.480 --> 07:37.440
on this photo.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.640
The shoes are so shiny that you can write them off.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.880
If you look carefully at the slide,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.040
you will see that the advertising slogan

07:45.040 --> 07:48.080
is not just text, but formulas.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.320
It is written, if you pay attention,

07:50.320 --> 07:52.320
it is like in a mirror reflection.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.320
That is, you really, like in a mirror,

07:54.320 --> 07:57.920
should see everything as it really is.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.000
What else did I want to draw your attention to

08:00.000 --> 08:00.800
on this slide?

08:00.800 --> 08:04.000
Please note that the deck is completely traditional,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.480
banal and maybe even a little old.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.360
You see some dirty corners,

08:09.360 --> 08:10.960
some scratches and so on.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.680
This is not some kind of elite establishment.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.040
This is ordinary, and here is the tape that is glued.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.760
That is, the whole plot is taken from life.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.920
And this is a very curious solution

08:23.920 --> 08:26.320
in the section of social advertising.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.360
We still have, in my opinion,

08:29.360 --> 08:31.280
a relationship with social advertising,

08:31.280 --> 08:34.880
let's say, not very worthy

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
in terms of the importance

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
that this direction should give.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.960
You probably remember one of the first

08:40.960 --> 08:42.960
social advertising,

08:42.960 --> 08:44.960
it's not shooting a pigeon,

08:44.960 --> 08:46.960
call your parents and so on.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
And if you remember that ad,

08:48.960 --> 08:50.960
call your parents,

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
it was generally very strange

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
and I remembered the parody of Yefim Shefrin

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
when he went on the stage

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
and said, he is playing the call to his father,

08:58.960 --> 09:00.960
the father asks him,

09:00.960 --> 09:02.960
what did you call, son?

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
Call your parents.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
And he called.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
Here, social advertising is solved more competently.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
You see, family and a wonderful phrase,

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
you harm those you love the most.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
You see, a man's hand with a cigarette,

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
it is as if taken out

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
beyond the framework of a family portrait.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
Another direction of social advertising,

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
in this case, the Olympic Sports Federation of Germany.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
Traditional sculpture,

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
you have probably seen it

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
more than once in your life.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
But you see how they

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
transformed it

09:33.120 --> 09:35.120
and made a wonderful slogan,

09:35.120 --> 09:37.120
if you do not move,

09:37.120 --> 09:39.120
you become fat.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.120
That is, you play the image

09:41.120 --> 09:43.120
which is generally known

09:43.120 --> 09:45.120
and it is quite popular,

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
but it shows you what can happen

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
if you stop doing physical culture.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.120
This is an ad,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.120
and the bill for strong teeth

09:53.120 --> 09:55.120
is very specific,

09:55.120 --> 09:57.120
very clear.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.120
Why did we include it in the selection?

09:59.200 --> 10:01.200
Today, bill advertising

10:01.200 --> 10:03.200
in terms of its popularity

10:03.200 --> 10:05.200
in promoting brands

10:05.200 --> 10:07.200
is probably one of the first trends

10:07.200 --> 10:09.200
in our country.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.200
Today,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
the trend is quite clear

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
and therefore,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
probably,

10:17.200 --> 10:19.200
ordinary techniques in bill advertising,

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
that is, such a tradition

10:21.200 --> 10:23.200
in presentation, in form,

10:23.200 --> 10:25.200
it is already obscured

10:25.200 --> 10:27.200
in perception

10:27.280 --> 10:29.280
and it does not attract the attention

10:29.280 --> 10:31.280
that should have been.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
Therefore, look at what an unexpected

10:33.280 --> 10:35.280
solution for bill advertising.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
Agree that if you go

10:37.280 --> 10:39.280
or will go,

10:39.280 --> 10:41.280
then such a bill will definitely

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
interest you

10:43.280 --> 10:45.280
and at least you will stop

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
and see what is there

10:47.280 --> 10:49.280
and read that it is a toothpaste.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.280
Very unexpected

10:51.280 --> 10:53.280
and very competent solution

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
in the Bryansk dentistry company.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.360
In fact,

10:57.360 --> 10:59.360
a classic bill advertisement

10:59.360 --> 11:01.360
on the fence is imitated,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.360
but in this case it is a shield

11:03.360 --> 11:05.360
and you are subconsciously told

11:05.360 --> 11:07.360
how popular it is

11:07.360 --> 11:09.360
that people seem to jump

11:09.360 --> 11:11.360
and try to tear off

11:11.360 --> 11:13.360
individual phones.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.360
That is, it is specially done

11:15.360 --> 11:17.360
that not all phones are below

11:17.360 --> 11:19.360
these petals,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.360
and some petals are torn off.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.360
That is, you are created an illusion

11:23.440 --> 11:25.440
that you are suffering here

11:25.440 --> 11:27.440
and tear off just to find out

11:27.440 --> 11:29.440
how to call this hypothetical company.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
Another solution

11:31.440 --> 11:33.440
for bill advertising

11:33.440 --> 11:35.440
is the traditional promotion

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
of seat belts and so on.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
Of course,

11:39.440 --> 11:41.440
such a solution is much more expensive.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
Firstly, because

11:43.440 --> 11:45.440
you occupy not one place,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
but two and so on.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
But agree, colleagues,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.440
that the audience gives a clear association

11:51.520 --> 11:53.520
with the product,

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
and the unexpected volume

11:55.520 --> 11:57.520
certainly attracts attention

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
and you will most likely notice it.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
Another example of bill advertising

12:01.520 --> 12:03.520
is the famous scotch tape.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.520
Please note that

12:05.520 --> 12:07.520
there is no text on this slide at all.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.520
Well, of course,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.520
the photo is taken from the street,

12:11.520 --> 12:13.520
so you probably won't be able

12:13.520 --> 12:15.520
to read the brand of the product,

12:15.520 --> 12:17.520
the brand of the tape that is written

12:17.520 --> 12:19.520
on the inside, but it really is.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
I'm not showing you the product

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
in its action.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
I'm just saying,

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
look, see this iron shield?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
It just sticks to my scotch tape.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
What else do you need

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
to prove that it is good,

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
high-quality and so on?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
I'm just showing you in reality

12:37.600 --> 12:39.600
how it all hangs in life.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
This is a shield

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
dedicated to laser epilation.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.600
It is made

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
with erotic elements,

12:47.680 --> 12:49.680
but pay attention

12:49.680 --> 12:51.680
to the fact

12:51.680 --> 12:53.680
that this eroticism

12:53.680 --> 12:55.680
is not direct,

12:55.680 --> 12:57.680
not frontal,

12:57.680 --> 12:59.680
but a very unambiguous

12:59.680 --> 13:01.680
classic association.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.680
It is quite obvious

13:03.680 --> 13:05.680
that you will definitely notice

13:05.680 --> 13:07.680
such a stand,

13:07.680 --> 13:09.680
you will definitely look at it.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.680
You will probably smile

13:11.680 --> 13:13.680
with some irony.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.680
And this irony,

13:15.760 --> 13:17.760
without insulting anyone's feelings,

13:17.760 --> 13:19.760
without insulting any public opinion,

13:19.760 --> 13:21.760
and so on,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.760
I think this is a very original

13:23.760 --> 13:25.760
and very competent solution.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.760
Another original solution

13:27.760 --> 13:29.760
from the point of view of shield advertising

13:29.760 --> 13:31.760
is the advertisement of the Economist magazine.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.760
Well, first of all,

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
I just wanted to remind you

13:35.760 --> 13:37.760
that the Economist magazine

13:37.760 --> 13:39.760
in its advertising, both printed and shield,

13:39.760 --> 13:41.760
traditionally uses only two colors,

13:41.760 --> 13:43.760
white and red.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.840
And this is because

13:45.840 --> 13:47.840
the Economist magazine

13:47.840 --> 13:49.840
has always been famous

13:49.840 --> 13:51.840
for its very competent

13:51.840 --> 13:53.840
work with texts and slogans.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.840
And it is not by chance

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
that the shield's location

13:57.840 --> 13:59.840
is crossed by a pillar,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
well, as it were,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.840
with a pillar of architecture,

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
it is not by chance

14:05.840 --> 14:07.840
that it is placed here,

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
because the slogan

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
that is used here

14:11.920 --> 14:13.920
is, in my opinion,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
one of the best slogans

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
and advertising shields

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
that the Economist magazine

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
had at the time.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.920
It is the same magazine,

14:23.920 --> 14:25.920
with a red tab and white numbers.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
The first tab

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
said 0% of foresight.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
The next tab

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
said 100% of competence.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.920
And the next tab

14:35.920 --> 14:37.920
said 360 degrees of view.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.920
For an economic

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
daily magazine

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
oriented to a fairly

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
professional audience,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
it is probably more difficult

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
to come up with a more accurate

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
slogan for promotion.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
That is, you have translated everything

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
into specific, unambiguously

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
perceivable numbers.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
0, 100, 360.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And a person understands

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
what he will have

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
when he reads this magazine.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
What is this slide

15:08.080 --> 15:10.080
about?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.080
The frames decide everything.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.080
I specifically included it in the subject

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
because today the topic of retro

15:16.080 --> 15:18.080
has become fashionable again.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.080
Let's say,

15:20.080 --> 15:22.080
revolutionary topics,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.080
topics related to

15:24.080 --> 15:26.080
post-war times, etc.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.080
And here,

15:28.080 --> 15:30.080
you see,

15:30.080 --> 15:32.080
many people do not immediately

15:32.080 --> 15:34.080
understand that

15:34.080 --> 15:36.080
in this case

15:36.160 --> 15:38.160
it is about a digital camera.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.160
The digital camera is so small

15:40.160 --> 15:42.160
that you still need to somehow look at

15:42.160 --> 15:44.160
the fact that the camera camera

15:44.160 --> 15:46.160
hangs on the chanel of the leader.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.160
Because it is the image of the leader

15:48.160 --> 15:50.160
that is played,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.160
the phrase that is, in general,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
well, quite popular

15:54.160 --> 15:56.160
and today it has also become very popular.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.160
The frames decide everything.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.160
By the way, if you look carefully,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.160
under it is written

16:02.160 --> 16:04.160
Joseph Stalin,

16:04.240 --> 16:06.240
which is very confusing in this poster.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.240
This is the phrase

16:08.240 --> 16:10.240
«In the network, too, look».

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
You see, «In the network, too, look»

16:12.240 --> 16:14.240
in combination with Joseph Stalin's image

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
has, in my opinion,

16:16.240 --> 16:18.240
a certain negative character.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.240
This is an unexpected

16:20.240 --> 16:22.240
advertisement

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
of gin and tonic

16:24.240 --> 16:26.240
in one of the Siberian cities.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.240
An advertising shield.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.240
What is the trick here?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.240
You know perfectly well that

16:32.320 --> 16:34.320
you can't advertise in such a way.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.320
Look how the colleagues here

16:36.320 --> 16:38.320
tried to get out of the situation gracefully.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.320
In fact, they wrote at the top

16:40.320 --> 16:42.320
«Gin tonic»

16:42.320 --> 16:44.320
alcohol content below this.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.320
But really, those of you who know this product,

16:46.320 --> 16:48.320
looking at the picture

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
on the right, they understand

16:50.320 --> 16:52.320
that this is not gin tonic,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
this is, excuse me, ordinary classical vodka.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
And the game is on the jargon.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
Yes, believe yourself,

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
you can eat more.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.400
But in general,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
as for the jargon,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
you have to be very careful here.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.400
Yes, because of such jargon expressions,

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
I personally liked

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
and remembered

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
the advertisement of one of the computer companies

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
that advertised

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
the latest model of the keyboard

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
by making such a slogan

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
«The keyboard is young,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.400
simple and reliable».

17:24.400 --> 17:26.400
This is such a game

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
in the young slang

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
of the keyboard as a keyboard.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.480
That is, as a keyboard,

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
as a feminine name,

17:34.480 --> 17:36.480
as a customary abbreviation,

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
and so on.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.480
You see, the ad was great

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
in the same company

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
for liquid crystal monitors.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.480
In those days,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
when they appeared on the market,

17:48.480 --> 17:50.480
they came out with such a slogan

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
«Love us flat».

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
But this solution,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
in my opinion, is quite controversial.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.560
It can affect

17:58.560 --> 18:00.560
a certain category of the public

18:00.560 --> 18:02.560
on the street.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.560
It can shock.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.560
An unexpected ad

18:06.560 --> 18:08.560
of chewing gum.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.560
You see how beautifully

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
this topic is played out,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.560
that chewing gum is inflated.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
Most likely,

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
this ad is aimed

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
primarily at the younger generation,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
for which such an irony,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
such an obviously unrealistic situation

18:24.640 --> 18:26.640
can cause certain positive emotions.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.640
Very original,

18:28.640 --> 18:30.640
very competent

18:30.640 --> 18:32.640
ad of Extra Fine.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.640
The pen of the super-thin.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.640
Look, a tiny piece

18:36.640 --> 18:38.640
of this plastic.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.640
And how much is written on it.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.640
After all, look how competently

18:42.640 --> 18:44.640
the scale of the slide is chosen.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.640
They show you the hand.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.640
You understand that such a hand

18:48.640 --> 18:50.640
in life cannot be.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
It is clearly enlarged.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
And on this piece you have

18:54.720 --> 18:56.720
phones, addresses,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.720
and all the questions

18:58.720 --> 19:00.720
about whether it is really very thin.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.720
They just disappear

19:02.720 --> 19:04.720
when you see the fact

19:04.720 --> 19:06.720
that it is thin.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.720
I will show you

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
what I will tell you.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
Look here how much

19:12.720 --> 19:14.720
I wrote on this piece of plastic.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.720
This is a new ad,

19:16.720 --> 19:18.720
also quite unexpected,

19:18.720 --> 19:20.720
quite curious.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
Credit for small and medium business.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
You see, for our loans,

19:24.800 --> 19:26.800
even big ones

19:26.800 --> 19:28.800
will want to become small.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
Yes, a traditional elephant

19:30.800 --> 19:32.800
and he has such an inscription on his ear.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
I am a cat. I am not big,

19:34.800 --> 19:36.800
but I am quite small.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
Not a traditional ad for tires

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
and wheels.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.800
Pay attention, colleagues,

19:42.800 --> 19:44.800
how it was done.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.800
That is, you see that this is a car theme

19:46.800 --> 19:48.800
based on the hangar that is.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.880
And the tires are served

19:50.880 --> 19:52.880
as a kind of jewelry.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.880
When you went to a jewelry store,

19:54.880 --> 19:56.880
you probably saw it.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.880
Any jewelry, a ring,

19:58.880 --> 20:00.880
is usually made

20:00.880 --> 20:02.880
in such velvet boxes.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.880
And to emphasize that it is a jewelry,

20:04.880 --> 20:06.880
pay attention, colleagues,

20:06.880 --> 20:08.880
each tire has such a thread

20:08.880 --> 20:10.880
and a tag in it,

20:10.880 --> 20:12.880
and something is written on it.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.880
Everything is imitated

20:14.880 --> 20:16.880
as if it were a jewelry.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
This category is

20:18.960 --> 20:20.960
a very significant thing,

20:20.960 --> 20:22.960
a very expensive thing

20:22.960 --> 20:24.960
and almost precious.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.960
A very unexpected ad

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
for lowering prices

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
for a discount program

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
for a Golf Starting car.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.960
First of all,

20:34.960 --> 20:36.960
pay attention to the combination.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.960
That is,

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
the idea is clear that the cheekbone has fallen,

20:40.960 --> 20:42.960
your index jaw has fallen

20:42.960 --> 20:44.960
from the moment you saw this price.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.040
But to make it clear

20:47.040 --> 20:49.040
why the index jaw has fallen,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
pay attention to the hands.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.040
The hands are clearly not of a young person.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.040
And then the combination of this structure

20:55.040 --> 20:57.040
of hands, veins,

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
and the fallen jaw

20:59.040 --> 21:01.040
creates an absolutely

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
unambiguous association.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.040
It would be unreasonable

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
to tell a young person

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
that his index jaw has fallen

21:09.040 --> 21:11.040
because the price has dropped

21:11.040 --> 21:13.040
by only 15-950 euros.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.120
You make a conclusion here.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
Everything is stylish

21:17.120 --> 21:19.120
and taken into account.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.120
Mistakes in the details

21:21.120 --> 21:23.120
that we talked about

21:23.120 --> 21:25.120
when we still have such situations

21:25.120 --> 21:27.120
in advertising.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
When we think about the details

21:29.120 --> 21:31.120
of the relationship,

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
there was a child with blue eyes,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.120
then with a fat one,

21:35.120 --> 21:37.120
then this.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.120
Here, there is no such detail.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.120
Everything is thought out very accurately.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
Advertising slogan

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
as an advertising motto

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
should be in two words,

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
in three words,

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
in four words.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.200
It should be very bright,

21:53.200 --> 21:55.200
very striking and encouraging.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
But there are a number of services,

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
a number of goods,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.200
including industrial goods,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
complex services,

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
where it is almost impossible

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
to express the idea

22:07.200 --> 22:09.200
and the motive

22:09.280 --> 22:11.280
of the purchase.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.280
Although we have a wonderful

22:13.280 --> 22:15.280
and rich Russian language,

22:15.280 --> 22:17.280
it is still not always possible

22:17.280 --> 22:19.280
to maneuver opportunities

22:19.280 --> 22:21.280
in three or four phrases.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.280
That is, to find something

22:23.280 --> 22:25.280
that no one has told you.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.280
Therefore, today,

22:27.280 --> 22:29.280
along with the concept

22:29.280 --> 22:31.280
of the shortness of the sister of talent,

22:31.280 --> 22:33.280
along with the bright,

22:33.280 --> 22:35.280
short,

22:35.280 --> 22:37.280
not long slogans,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.360
it is very fashionable

22:39.360 --> 22:41.360
and, in my opinion,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.360
it is very correct

22:43.360 --> 22:45.360
that some philosophical essays

22:45.360 --> 22:47.360
began to appear.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.360
One of the first

22:49.360 --> 22:51.360
who started doing this

22:51.360 --> 22:53.360
was the Rybak company.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.360
And look,

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
I just took one of the solutions

22:57.360 --> 22:59.360
from two years ago.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.360
It would seem,

23:01.360 --> 23:03.360
this is such a plot,

23:03.360 --> 23:05.360
you see a girl running,

23:05.440 --> 23:07.440
she is clearly, let's say,

23:07.440 --> 23:09.440
such an ordinary ordinary person

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
and not in uniform.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
And you see that man

23:13.440 --> 23:15.440
who is there,

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
half already in the ground,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
his hands are already twisted.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
And look what a wonderful phrase

23:21.440 --> 23:23.440
from the point of view of philosophy

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
and action.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
When exhaustion makes the tired,

23:27.440 --> 23:29.440
when suffering twists from pain,

23:29.440 --> 23:31.440
when defeat prepares a white flag,

23:31.440 --> 23:33.440
I will still be here,

23:33.520 --> 23:35.520
this is self-assertion,

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
that when it would seem,

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
you see what sky,

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
everything is so angry,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
everything is so gloomy,

23:43.520 --> 23:45.520
but I'm still here

23:45.520 --> 23:47.520
and I'm not just standing here,

23:47.520 --> 23:49.520
I don't know, waiting for something,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.520
I'm running,

23:51.520 --> 23:53.520
that is, I continue to act,

23:53.520 --> 23:55.520
I live.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
Another unexpected solution

23:57.520 --> 23:59.520
for advertising the same sneakers.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.520
You see how basketball shoes are advertised.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.600
The advertisement is on the top of the billboard,

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
with jars,

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
that is, on the one hand,

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
you will notice it,

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
on the other hand,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
you are offered to try

24:13.600 --> 24:15.600
to get into this basket,

24:15.600 --> 24:17.600
because the basket

24:17.600 --> 24:19.600
is completely real.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
In my opinion,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.600
such a daring solution

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600
of this billboard,

24:25.600 --> 24:27.600
on which you see,

24:27.600 --> 24:29.600
probably,

24:29.680 --> 24:31.680
is the most suitable for everyone.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.680
It's beautiful to write

24:33.680 --> 24:35.680
that not everyone can become a client

24:35.680 --> 24:37.680
of our clinic,

24:37.680 --> 24:39.680
we choose the clients,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
but you must understand

24:41.680 --> 24:43.680
that some of the potential clients

24:43.680 --> 24:45.680
you can always reject from yourself,

24:45.680 --> 24:47.680
even though

24:47.680 --> 24:49.680
you can count on

24:49.680 --> 24:51.680
that there are elite categories of clients

24:51.680 --> 24:53.680
who will say that I am worthy.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
Probably, if you are a very famous company,

24:55.680 --> 24:57.680
if you have some kind of

24:57.760 --> 24:59.760
super-spinning image,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.760
it is positive,

25:01.760 --> 25:03.760
you can try to take a risk.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.760
But in my opinion,

25:05.760 --> 25:07.760
such a solution is quite controversial.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.760
It is quite controversial

25:09.760 --> 25:11.760
in terms of

25:11.760 --> 25:13.760
promoting your consumers

25:13.760 --> 25:15.760
to use your services.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.760
This ad was

25:17.760 --> 25:19.760
from the very beginning

25:19.760 --> 25:21.760
on the eve of our

25:21.760 --> 25:23.760
2007,

25:23.760 --> 25:25.760
when this large

25:25.840 --> 25:27.840
mega-electronics store

25:27.840 --> 25:29.840
Mediamarkt

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
tried to play the theme of the year

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
of the Pig Year.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
But, you know, colleagues,

25:35.840 --> 25:37.840
the name of the five

25:37.840 --> 25:39.840
and the head of this pig

25:39.840 --> 25:41.840
is probably good,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
probably attracts attention.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.840
But, you know, colleagues,

25:45.840 --> 25:47.840
the Mediamarkt store

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
is not a category

25:49.840 --> 25:51.840
of goods

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
of close,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
very low prices.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.920
This is, in general,

25:57.920 --> 25:59.920
a high-quality and not the cheapest

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
technology.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
And maybe in this sense

26:03.920 --> 26:05.920
to address buyers with the phrase

26:05.920 --> 26:07.920
«Sneeze at low prices»

26:07.920 --> 26:09.920
can, in my opinion,

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
cause a potential consumer

26:11.920 --> 26:13.920
some kind of caution,

26:13.920 --> 26:15.920
or maybe even a negative.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.920
The next ad

26:17.920 --> 26:19.920
is a famous

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
Moscow network

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
of perfumery and cosmetics

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
«L'Etoile»

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
«Go for the smell»

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It is quite obvious, colleagues,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
that it is impossible

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
not to notice such a shield.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
But how much

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
a person, a buyer

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
or, moreover, a buyer

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
of, say, perfumery and cosmetics

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
from the category,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
but clearly not related to the category

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
of the mass,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
such a visual image

26:50.080 --> 26:52.080
will promote him

26:52.080 --> 26:54.080
to the purchase.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
You see, here the horse

26:56.080 --> 26:58.080
even around the eyes

26:58.080 --> 27:00.080
shadows are laid, and so on.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.080
Remember, we talked

27:02.080 --> 27:04.080
about typical mistakes

27:04.080 --> 27:06.080
in the ad campaign

27:06.080 --> 27:08.080
of Russian brands

27:08.080 --> 27:10.080
about the lack of context.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.080
In this case, in my opinion,

27:12.080 --> 27:14.080
it is such a vivid example.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.080
Advertisements of Arda refrigerators.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.080
What do we see here?

27:18.160 --> 27:20.160
A man holding

27:20.160 --> 27:22.160
a very expensive

27:22.160 --> 27:24.160
decoration in the form of a pendant

27:24.160 --> 27:26.160
or a chain,

27:26.160 --> 27:28.160
and a young woman

27:28.160 --> 27:30.160
who does not react

27:30.160 --> 27:32.160
to this gesture at all,

27:32.160 --> 27:34.160
but is only interested

27:34.160 --> 27:36.160
in the refrigerator.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.160
All her eyes,

27:38.160 --> 27:40.160
all her aspirations

27:40.160 --> 27:42.160
are only for this refrigerator.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.160
How adequate is this?

27:44.160 --> 27:46.160
It seems to me that

27:46.240 --> 27:48.240
somehow,

27:48.240 --> 27:50.240
how to tell you,

27:50.240 --> 27:52.240
there is a slight inconsistency

27:52.240 --> 27:54.240
between the first and the second.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
Because the refrigerator,

27:56.240 --> 27:58.240
whatever it is,

27:58.240 --> 28:00.240
is a slightly different function

28:00.240 --> 28:02.240
than a chain, a pendant,

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
which allows you to have

28:04.240 --> 28:06.240
some other inner feelings,

28:06.240 --> 28:08.240
even from the point of view of self-assertion.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.240
We took this ad shield

28:10.240 --> 28:12.240
in the city of Tomsk

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
near GUM,

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
on the eve of the New Year.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
What did he attract us with?

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
He attracted us

28:20.320 --> 28:22.320
with this expression of a girl.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.320
Look at the expression

28:24.320 --> 28:26.320
in her face,

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
in her movements of her hands,

28:28.320 --> 28:30.320
and in this phrase

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
«You promised me a fur coat».

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
It seems to me that from the point of view

28:34.320 --> 28:36.320
of the female audience,

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
this is a completely accurate

28:38.320 --> 28:40.320
address,

28:40.320 --> 28:42.320
that is, an exact address

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
of a friend, a partner,

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
and so on.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
It is you who promised

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
and you must do it.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
Look very carefully at her expression,

28:52.400 --> 28:54.400
even at the muscles

28:54.400 --> 28:56.400
that she has on her forehead.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
This is the expression, the energy.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
It was this that attracted us

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
to include this poster

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
in the collection.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
The ad shield

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
dedicated to the 15th anniversary

29:08.400 --> 29:10.400
of the publishing house «Commercant»

29:10.480 --> 29:12.480
that most of you are familiar with.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.480
This is what was recognized

29:14.480 --> 29:16.480
as the best ad shield of the year.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
Perhaps,

29:18.480 --> 29:20.480
it would not have caused

29:20.480 --> 29:22.480
such a stir,

29:22.480 --> 29:24.480
although the phrase

29:24.480 --> 29:26.480
is very cleverly thought out

29:26.480 --> 29:28.480
from the point of view of the name

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
and the 15-year term,

29:30.480 --> 29:32.480
if this shield had not appeared

29:32.480 --> 29:34.480
on the Lubyanka Square for the first time.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.480
The same «Commercant»

29:36.480 --> 29:38.480
house had another ad shield

29:38.560 --> 29:40.560
that sounded like

29:40.560 --> 29:42.560
«There would be a «Commercant»,

29:42.560 --> 29:44.560
but the article will be found».

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
That is, the same theme,

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
played out,

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
but in this case

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
the name «Commercant» is played out

29:52.560 --> 29:54.560
very competently.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.560
And this is the second plan,

29:56.560 --> 29:58.560
the second context

29:58.560 --> 30:00.560
that allows us to speak

30:00.560 --> 30:02.560
the native Russian language.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.560
One of the last solutions

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
that we saw from the point of view

30:06.640 --> 30:08.640
of the «Commercant» house

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
is the fact that

30:10.640 --> 30:12.640
the world of the wild nature

30:12.640 --> 30:14.640
is waiting for you.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.640
The wild nature,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.640
this beast,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.640
and he has such a beautiful mouth,

30:20.640 --> 30:22.640
he says,

30:22.640 --> 30:24.640
he is ready for you to come,

30:24.640 --> 30:26.640
come,

30:26.640 --> 30:28.640
and we will have dinner,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.640
lunch, breakfast,

30:30.640 --> 30:32.640
as it turns out.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.640
This is a good,

30:34.720 --> 30:36.720
this is a good idea,

30:36.720 --> 30:38.720
but he says,

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
you want some kind of exotic,

30:40.720 --> 30:42.720
but you subconsciously mean

30:42.720 --> 30:44.720
that in the wild nature

30:44.720 --> 30:46.720
there may be such animals

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
that can be waiting for you

30:48.720 --> 30:50.720
on all these safaris,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
and so on.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.720
Another tour operator.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.720
Yes, look,

30:56.720 --> 30:58.720
how curious this poster is.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.720
If you remove the signature

31:00.720 --> 31:02.720
of the float in this ad,

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
the majority of you,

31:04.800 --> 31:06.800
regardless of your gender and age,

31:06.800 --> 31:08.800
most likely,

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
you know,

31:10.800 --> 31:12.800
there is some kind of greed,

31:12.800 --> 31:14.800
you will be a little affected

31:14.800 --> 31:16.800
by such an appeal.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.800
But all in all,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
one element of the solution.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.800
You add the signature of the float,

31:22.800 --> 31:24.800
you bring in the element

31:24.800 --> 31:26.800
of ironic humor,

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
and you do what you

31:28.800 --> 31:30.800
remember,

31:30.880 --> 31:32.880
and it's all interesting.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.880
The advertising shield of the

31:34.880 --> 31:36.880
hypermarket of wholesale prices

31:36.880 --> 31:38.880
may seem to someone

31:38.880 --> 31:40.880
the primitiveness

31:40.880 --> 31:42.880
of this slogan.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.880
You see, colleagues,

31:44.880 --> 31:46.880
in my opinion,

31:46.880 --> 31:48.880
it is absolutely professional

31:48.880 --> 31:50.880
because it is focused

31:50.880 --> 31:52.880
on the wholesale.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
On a person of a certain

31:54.880 --> 31:56.880
mentality and, pardon,

31:56.880 --> 31:58.880
a certain level of education.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.960
In his understandable jargon,

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
most likely,

32:02.960 --> 32:04.960
it will move him to come

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
and see what is actually offered

32:06.960 --> 32:08.960
and at what real prices.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.960
This is one of the rare

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
Beline advertising companies

32:12.960 --> 32:14.960
back in 1996,

32:14.960 --> 32:16.960
if I remember correctly.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.960
Advertising half-stripe

32:18.960 --> 32:20.960
in the newspaper

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
Commercant Daily.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.960
It was going somewhere

32:24.960 --> 32:26.960
in the middle of the year

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
and it was going

32:29.040 --> 32:31.040
three or four times in a row.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.040
I think it was the second

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
or the third, I don't remember.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
But it was exactly the half-stripe

32:37.040 --> 32:39.040
of Commercant Daily.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.040
Look at what, in my opinion,

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
a little tough text.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
Do not listen to those who advise,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.040
do not listen to those who assert.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.040
Do not believe anyone,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
even yourself.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
Believe this advertising.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.040
Well, somehow, you know,

32:55.120 --> 32:57.120
there is some element of

32:57.120 --> 32:59.120
such an imposition.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.120
That is, this is advertising,

33:01.120 --> 33:03.120
as it is true in the last instance,

33:03.120 --> 33:05.120
today, when we generally have

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
so many conversations about quality,

33:07.120 --> 33:09.120
reliability, and so on,

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
advertising, probably,

33:11.120 --> 33:13.120
but you don't have to do that.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.120
But they don't do it.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.120
I just left you this example

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
so that you just remember

33:19.120 --> 33:21.120
that there were such options.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.120
Another option for an advertising invitation

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
to the seminar training

33:25.200 --> 33:27.200
is the modern methods of conducting

33:27.200 --> 33:29.200
competitive wrestling.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.200
So that you have no illusions

33:31.200 --> 33:33.200
of what competitive wrestling is

33:33.200 --> 33:35.200
and how to deal with it,

33:35.200 --> 33:37.200
what methods of its conduct,

33:37.200 --> 33:39.200
I will give you on the left side,

33:39.200 --> 33:41.200
not me, I mean the customer,

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
on the left side,

33:43.200 --> 33:45.200
a completely specific graphical image

33:45.200 --> 33:47.200
of a self-propelled gun,

33:47.200 --> 33:49.200
caterpillars, antennas,

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
and so on.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
And when you write

33:53.280 --> 33:55.280
the phrase

33:55.280 --> 33:57.280
of an invitation to a seminar training,

33:57.280 --> 33:59.280
there are some associations with training.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.280
Training is a practical activity.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
What practical activities

34:03.280 --> 34:05.280
within a seminar can be with such

34:05.280 --> 34:07.280
military equipment?

34:07.280 --> 34:09.280
And now, colleagues,

34:09.280 --> 34:11.280
I would like to draw your attention

34:11.280 --> 34:13.280
to this slide.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.280
This is a completely new approach

34:15.280 --> 34:17.280
to the promotion of goods and services.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
So, this is a series,

34:19.360 --> 34:21.360
an advertising campaign

34:21.360 --> 34:23.360
that was held in the city of Riga

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
and in all the republics of Latvia,

34:25.360 --> 34:27.360
where services

34:27.360 --> 34:29.360
of bank credit cards

34:29.360 --> 34:31.360
were promoted.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.360
Colleagues, advertisers,

34:33.360 --> 34:35.360
as, how to say,

34:35.360 --> 34:37.360
heroes of advertising campaigns,

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
accounts, posters, and so on,

34:39.360 --> 34:41.360
chose real

34:41.360 --> 34:43.360
pocket criminals

34:43.360 --> 34:45.360
who,

34:45.360 --> 34:47.360
how to say,

34:47.440 --> 34:49.440
were in prison for pocket thefts.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.440
Of course,

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
they were involved in contracts,

34:53.440 --> 34:55.440
and so on.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.440
Here is one of the examples.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.440
So, here is such a,

34:59.440 --> 35:01.440
I would say, not the most kind face,

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
who looks at you

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
with such a stern look

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
and what text

35:07.440 --> 35:09.440
is on this advertising account.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
It really pisses me off

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
when you take out

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
your wallet at risk,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.520
and there is only a card

35:17.520 --> 35:19.520
and no cash.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.520
It's terribly infuriating.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
Carry cash with you,

35:23.520 --> 35:25.520
as all normal people do.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.520
Don't imagine

35:27.520 --> 35:29.520
all that is about this piece of plastic.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
And now imagine

35:31.520 --> 35:33.520
the situation that you are standing at a bus stop

35:33.520 --> 35:35.520
and such a not very friendly

35:35.520 --> 35:37.520
face says,

35:37.520 --> 35:39.520
well, you are annoying me,

35:39.520 --> 35:41.520
I climbed up to you,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.520
I kind of made

35:43.600 --> 35:45.600
a kind of kindness

35:45.600 --> 35:47.600
and here you are,

35:47.600 --> 35:49.600
and you have a piece of plastic there.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
How effective is this? It's hard to say.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.600
But the move is completely unexpected,

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
and everything unexpected in advertising

35:55.600 --> 35:57.600
is perceived very well,

35:57.600 --> 35:59.600
better than some

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600
traditional,

36:01.600 --> 36:03.600
outdated tricks.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.600
A very original solution,

36:05.600 --> 36:07.600
a very original solution

36:07.600 --> 36:09.600
by Federal Express.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.600
Federal Express is a carrier,

36:11.680 --> 36:13.680
and so on,

36:13.680 --> 36:15.680
all over the world.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.680
The company is in the DHL category,

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
for example, we have EMC,

36:19.680 --> 36:21.680
Garan Post, and so on.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.680
Look how gracefully

36:23.680 --> 36:25.680
they played their advantage

36:25.680 --> 36:27.680
over the DHL company.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.680
You see the packaging,

36:29.680 --> 36:31.680
in it, some kind of packaging,

36:31.680 --> 36:33.680
only those who are familiar

36:33.680 --> 36:35.680
with this,

36:35.680 --> 36:37.680
will see that on the inside

36:37.680 --> 36:39.680
of the white packaging,

36:39.760 --> 36:41.760
you see the end of the DHL inscription.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.760
Formally,

36:43.760 --> 36:45.760
there is no direct

36:45.760 --> 36:47.760
opposition of competitors.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.760
That is, for those who understand,

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
it is clear,

36:51.760 --> 36:53.760
but for the rest,

36:53.760 --> 36:55.760
probably, it is not very necessary.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.760
A very clever solution,

36:57.760 --> 36:59.760
in my opinion,

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
and does not allow

37:01.760 --> 37:03.760
to appeal to a direct

37:03.760 --> 37:05.760
opposition

37:05.760 --> 37:07.760
in advertising,

37:07.840 --> 37:09.840
but it is clear that

37:09.840 --> 37:11.840
there is no direct opposition

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
of competitors,

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
and so on.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.840
I'm not trying to defame

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
your reputation,

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
I'm just saying subconsciously

37:21.840 --> 37:23.840
that your shipping

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
goes through my channels,

37:25.840 --> 37:27.840
but there is no such thing.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.840
We brought this poster

37:29.840 --> 37:31.840
from Kaliningrad,

37:31.840 --> 37:33.840
which is Konigsberg.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.840
What amazed us?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.920
If you,

37:37.920 --> 37:39.920
especially representatives

37:39.920 --> 37:41.920
of the beautiful sex,

37:41.920 --> 37:43.920
consider yourself

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
or belong to the category

37:45.920 --> 37:47.920
of an aristocrat,

37:47.920 --> 37:49.920
then probably the word

37:49.920 --> 37:51.920
washbasin

37:51.920 --> 37:53.920
is not from your lexicon at all.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
But if we assume

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
and accept it as possible,

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
then please look carefully

37:59.920 --> 38:01.920
at the glasses that lie

38:01.920 --> 38:03.920
in this water.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
They are a little more significant

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
than in general drinking.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
You can't take it away.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
If it's a washbasin for aristocrats,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
then at least

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
there should not be the same dishes.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I say it again,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
a washbasin for aristocrats

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
is some kind of strange nonsense.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
If an aristocrat,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
then what kind of washbasin?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
One of the advertising companies,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
or rather posters,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
MTS,

38:32.080 --> 38:34.080
which advertised today's rebranding

38:34.080 --> 38:36.080
and everything is in your hands.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
In this case,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.080
the Hands Free system is advertised.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.080
When we first saw this poster,

38:42.080 --> 38:44.080
we involuntarily remembered

38:44.080 --> 38:46.080
the wonderful song by Angelika Ivarovna.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
Do you remember how it was?

38:48.080 --> 38:50.080
I know everything is in your hands,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.080
even me.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
This association is simply

38:54.080 --> 38:56.080
asked about.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.080
In my opinion,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.080
and in the opinion of many colleagues,

39:00.160 --> 39:02.160
this is the most interesting

39:02.160 --> 39:04.160
of all the posters on the Internet

39:04.160 --> 39:06.160
on the washbasin.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.160
What is it curious about?

39:08.160 --> 39:10.160
If you imagine that you are going

39:10.160 --> 39:12.160
on the street

39:12.160 --> 39:14.160
and see such a huge poster

39:14.160 --> 39:16.160
with such a phrase,

39:16.160 --> 39:18.160
you will involuntarily

39:18.160 --> 39:20.160
tremble inside.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
Because the expression

39:22.160 --> 39:24.160
is not considered

39:24.160 --> 39:26.160
a wish of the best,

39:26.160 --> 39:28.160
the best,

39:28.240 --> 39:30.240
but rather a wish

39:30.240 --> 39:32.240
of the best.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.240
In this case,

39:34.240 --> 39:36.240
the poster is not only

39:36.240 --> 39:38.240
on the washbasin,

39:38.240 --> 39:40.240
but also on the advertising.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.240
There is a very specific product,

39:42.240 --> 39:44.240
it is photographed.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.240
The product is a mess in the canteen.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.240
I don't know what you mean.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.240
In this case,

39:50.240 --> 39:52.240
I meant the product

39:52.240 --> 39:54.240
that is in the corner

39:54.240 --> 39:56.240
on the poster.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
The next item is a calendar.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
A small calendar table.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
You all know it well.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
TEX Import is a company

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
from the category

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
of former foreign trade unions.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.320
Why did he interest us

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
and why did we include him

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
in our selection?

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
We really liked the idea itself.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
This is the spraying

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
where the arrow

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
on the hip part

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
of this man

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
is sprayed.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
This is a very simple

40:28.400 --> 40:30.400
Russian phrase

40:30.400 --> 40:32.400
– throw off your panties.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
This is our expression

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
– throw it off.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
You are offered

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
to take something hard,

40:40.400 --> 40:42.400
a coin,

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
as we used to do

40:44.400 --> 40:46.400
when we activated

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
cards on the phone.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.400
You wash it off.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
What do you see?

40:52.480 --> 40:54.480
This is a good element of humor.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.480
But in my opinion,

40:56.480 --> 40:58.480
it would be more appropriate

40:58.480 --> 41:00.480
for more mass products,

41:00.480 --> 41:02.480
for a wider audience.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.480
It would be a nice joke.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.480
If it is a company

41:06.480 --> 41:08.480
of a higher scale

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
and more serious services,

41:10.480 --> 41:12.480
there is a danger

41:12.480 --> 41:14.480
that it may not be

41:14.480 --> 41:16.480
adequately perceived.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.480
The next item

41:18.480 --> 41:20.480
is a calendar.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.560
It is a very unexpected

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
solution

41:24.560 --> 41:26.560
of the last year.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.560
These are ritual services.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Look,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.560
you see

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
a memorial place

41:34.560 --> 41:36.560
where you have a urn

41:36.560 --> 41:38.560
and a wonderful phrase

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
– luxurious urns

41:40.560 --> 41:42.560
– in the sense of a coffin

41:42.560 --> 41:44.560
– and there is a microphone

41:44.560 --> 41:46.560
and you hear

41:46.560 --> 41:48.560
– no one has complained yet.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.640
The topic of irony

41:50.640 --> 41:52.640
and humor

41:52.640 --> 41:54.640
is in a completely

41:54.640 --> 41:56.640
non-traditional

41:56.640 --> 41:58.640
sphere of services.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.640
If you think about it,

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
who can complain about it?

42:02.640 --> 42:04.640
And in the picture

42:04.640 --> 42:06.640
you see a microphone

42:06.640 --> 42:08.640
and a wire near the memorial urn.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.640
You see that everything is on

42:10.640 --> 42:12.640
but no one has complained

42:12.640 --> 42:14.640
that he is not comfortable there.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.640
You see,

42:16.720 --> 42:18.720
ritual services

42:18.720 --> 42:20.720
are also services

42:20.720 --> 42:22.720
and they should be promoted

42:22.720 --> 42:24.720
and advertised.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.720
It may be

42:26.720 --> 42:28.720
a little harsh,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
but it is clear

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
that it will be remembered

42:32.720 --> 42:34.720
rather than just

42:34.720 --> 42:36.720
mentioning several options

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
of memorial urns

42:38.720 --> 42:40.720
and saying that our urns

42:40.720 --> 42:42.720
are the most wonderful.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.720
Rather, such a solution

42:44.800 --> 42:46.800
is more suitable

42:46.800 --> 42:48.800
for those who have

42:48.800 --> 42:50.800
a problem with it.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.800
The same topic

42:52.800 --> 42:54.800
is played out

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
in the ritual agency

42:56.800 --> 42:58.800
of Yesenia.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.800
You see,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.800
here it is written

43:02.800 --> 43:04.800
on the advertising board

43:04.800 --> 43:06.800
– drunk or drunk,

43:06.800 --> 43:08.800
we are waiting for you.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.800
And on the left,

43:10.800 --> 43:12.800
to make this ad a little softer,

43:12.880 --> 43:14.880
to make it a social approach.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.880
We say that

43:16.880 --> 43:18.880
drunk or drunk,

43:18.880 --> 43:20.880
we are not waiting for you at all,

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
but drunk or drunk.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.880
One of the ads

43:24.880 --> 43:26.880
of the mid-90s

43:26.880 --> 43:28.880
is that

43:28.880 --> 43:30.880
I have never heard

43:30.880 --> 43:32.880
the combination

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
of eating sadness.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.880
In Russian, there was always

43:36.880 --> 43:38.880
the expression

43:38.880 --> 43:40.880
to drown the sadness.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.960
I don't know,

43:42.960 --> 43:44.960
with cheese, sausage,

43:44.960 --> 43:46.960
something else.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.960
But somehow it was not met.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.960
And so, such a move

43:50.960 --> 43:52.960
to eat sadness

43:52.960 --> 43:54.960
with Edam cheese,

43:54.960 --> 43:56.960
I don't know.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.960
It seems to me that

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
there is no such thing.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.960
If you use the context

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
of the Russian language,

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
then it must be used

44:06.960 --> 44:08.960
in close-minded terms.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.040
But it must be appropriate.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.040
It must be unobtrusive.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.040
It should not pressure.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
It should not cause

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
a rebellion among the population.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
It should not be that,

44:21.040 --> 44:23.040
as if parents said,

44:23.040 --> 44:25.040
do not need to watch it,

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
were afraid to go out somewhere,

44:27.040 --> 44:29.040
to show some magazines,

44:29.040 --> 44:31.040
and so on.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
In my opinion,

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
inappropriate use

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
of the erotic theme

44:37.120 --> 44:39.120
You see,

44:39.120 --> 44:41.120
we keep promises

44:41.120 --> 44:43.120
and guarantee quality

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
below.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.120
Also erotic advertising,

44:47.120 --> 44:49.120
but made more competently.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.120
This is an advertising blog

44:51.120 --> 44:53.120
from the Expert magazine.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.120
Respectable edition.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.120
Hypothetical lending plus gift.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.120
Here is a wonderful phrase

44:59.120 --> 45:01.120
about the fulfillment of a dream.

45:01.120 --> 45:03.120
And there is a woman's hand,

45:03.120 --> 45:05.120
a ring, keys.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.200
There is no forehead.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.200
There are only hints,

45:09.200 --> 45:11.200
some lines.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.200
The fulfillment of a dream reminded me

45:13.200 --> 45:15.200
how once we saw

45:15.200 --> 45:17.200
a very competent advertising slogan

45:17.200 --> 45:19.200
of one of the first casinos

45:19.200 --> 45:21.200
in St. Petersburg.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.200
You know how it was written there?

45:23.200 --> 45:25.200
You walk along Nevsky,

45:25.200 --> 45:27.200
you see this casino,

45:27.200 --> 45:29.200
I don't remember what the picture was,

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
but it was a wonderful slogan.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.200
Try to get in.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.280
Try to taste the sin.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.280
That is, from the very beginning

45:37.280 --> 45:39.280
you were told that

45:39.280 --> 45:41.280
yes, visiting a casino is certainly

45:41.280 --> 45:43.280
not a plus, it is a sin.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.280
But again, you were told

45:45.280 --> 45:47.280
that in life everything must be tried.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.280
Try the taste of sin.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.280
Maybe you won't like it,

45:51.280 --> 45:53.280
but try it.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.280
I didn't impose,

45:55.280 --> 45:57.280
but very intelligently

45:57.280 --> 45:59.280
warned that it was a sin.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.280
Another erotic theme.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.360
This is a sports app

46:03.360 --> 46:05.360
for the Observer magazine.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.360
You know,

46:07.360 --> 46:09.360
colleagues,

46:09.360 --> 46:11.360
that this is a very serious

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
analytical publication.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.360
Look at what it means

46:15.360 --> 46:17.360
and how it uses

46:17.360 --> 46:19.360
the same topic of eroticism

46:19.360 --> 46:21.360
in promoting its sports review.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.360
The slides, the plots

46:23.360 --> 46:25.360
that we have taken

46:25.360 --> 46:27.360
within the framework of the viewing

46:27.360 --> 46:29.360
of sports programs and so on

46:29.440 --> 46:31.440
and you have seen them

46:31.440 --> 46:33.440
more than once.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
And suddenly you are suddenly asked

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
if you remember this frame.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
Well, let's say figure skating

46:39.440 --> 46:41.440
or bobsleigh or wrestling.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.440
Do you remember this frame?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.440
You say, of course I remember.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.440
And suddenly you are asked

46:47.440 --> 46:49.440
if you have ever thought

46:49.440 --> 46:51.440
that people may have a certain problem

46:51.440 --> 46:53.440
as it is written here

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
no sex before sports.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.440
Have you ever thought

46:57.520 --> 46:59.520
that it is a very serious topic

46:59.520 --> 47:01.520
and you are asked

47:01.520 --> 47:03.520
whether you remember

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520
this frame.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.520
And suddenly you are asked

47:07.520 --> 47:09.520
if you have ever thought

47:09.520 --> 47:11.520
that people may have a certain problem

47:11.520 --> 47:13.520
as it is written here

47:13.520 --> 47:15.520
no sex before sports.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.520
And suddenly you are asked

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
whether you remember

47:19.520 --> 47:21.520
this frame.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.520
And suddenly you are asked

47:23.520 --> 47:25.520
whether you remember

47:25.520 --> 47:27.600
this frame.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.520
And here I would like to draw your attention

47:57.520 --> 47:59.520
to the fact that

47:59.520 --> 48:01.520
the car is a family.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.520
So how many people are there?

48:03.520 --> 48:05.520
Most likely,

48:05.520 --> 48:07.520
we do not take minivans,

48:07.520 --> 48:09.520
buses and so on.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.520
That is, five people.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.520
Therefore, there are exactly five people

48:13.520 --> 48:15.520
in the lower layer on the rope.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.520
Moreover, you can clearly see

48:17.520 --> 48:19.520
that among the lower layer

48:19.520 --> 48:21.520
there are parents,

48:21.520 --> 48:23.520
and there are children.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.520
Most likely, there are children.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.520
And when you hear

48:27.520 --> 48:29.520
this slide,

48:29.520 --> 48:31.520
you say,

48:31.520 --> 48:33.520
these elements of dirty spots

48:33.520 --> 48:35.520
should shock you.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.520
But on the other hand,

48:37.520 --> 48:39.520
yes, this is exactly what attracts attention.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
But most importantly,

48:41.520 --> 48:43.520
on the other hand,

48:43.520 --> 48:45.520
they show you how scary it was for people.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.520
This fear

48:47.520 --> 48:49.520
has poured out into these spots.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.520
But at the same time,

48:51.520 --> 48:53.520
it means that they are all alive.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
And the main task of the tires

48:55.520 --> 48:57.520
is that they have saved lives.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.520
It is solved.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.520
Well, colleagues,

49:01.520 --> 49:03.520
this is a small fragment

49:03.520 --> 49:05.520
that we have included for you.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.520
I would like to draw your attention

49:07.520 --> 49:09.520
to the fact that

49:09.520 --> 49:11.520
you should be careful

49:11.520 --> 49:13.520
when you walk down the street,

49:13.520 --> 49:15.520
when you watch advertising videos,

49:15.520 --> 49:17.520
watch magazines and so on.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.520
Look at the solutions

49:19.520 --> 49:21.520
that are offered.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.520
Try to understand every time

49:23.520 --> 49:25.520
what the customer wanted to bring in.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.520
Try to think for yourself,

49:27.520 --> 49:29.520
if you can say so,

49:29.520 --> 49:31.520
to refine this program.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.520
Train your mind.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.520
You will better perceive

49:35.520 --> 49:37.520
someone else's advertising.

49:37.520 --> 49:39.520
You will be more familiar

49:39.520 --> 49:41.520
and more,

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
yes, more moments

49:43.520 --> 49:45.520
that push you to come up with

49:45.520 --> 49:47.520
something so original and so on.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.520
At the same time,

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
I would like to draw your attention

49:51.520 --> 49:53.520
to the fact that

49:53.520 --> 49:55.520
we have such a habit.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.520
If we work in some business sphere

49:57.520 --> 49:59.520
and we have a task of developing

49:59.520 --> 50:01.520
the brand concept,

50:01.520 --> 50:03.520
we start to study

50:03.520 --> 50:05.520
everything that our competitors

50:05.520 --> 50:07.520
do within our industry.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.520
And everything that we see in advertising,

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
what we see on TV,

50:11.520 --> 50:13.520
on the billboards,

50:13.520 --> 50:15.520
we ignore because

50:15.520 --> 50:17.520
we are not interested in everything

50:17.520 --> 50:19.520
that is in perfumery.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.520
Everything that is in alcohol is not for us.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.520
This is, in my opinion,

50:23.520 --> 50:25.520
one of the biggest mistakes.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.520
You see, colleagues,

50:27.520 --> 50:29.520
most likely everything that could be

50:29.520 --> 50:31.520
invented, original,

50:31.520 --> 50:33.520
and in the decision of promoting

50:33.520 --> 50:35.520
your brand within your industry,

50:35.520 --> 50:37.520
your business specifics,

50:37.520 --> 50:39.520
most likely it is almost

50:39.520 --> 50:41.520
all chosen.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.520
Therefore, watch advertising as such.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.520
Look for a technique, look for a move.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.520
You see, advertising

50:47.520 --> 50:49.520
affects the psychology of the consumer's perception.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.520
And the consumer,

50:51.520 --> 50:53.520
in terms of his psychotype,

50:53.520 --> 50:55.520
he is alone.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.520
What is he interested in?

50:57.520 --> 50:59.520
Is he interested in expensive washing machines?

50:59.520 --> 51:01.520
What is he interested in?

51:01.520 --> 51:03.520
Is he interested in jewelry, and so on.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.520
Motives that promote him to action,

51:05.520 --> 51:07.520
they are approximately,

51:07.520 --> 51:09.520
how can I tell you,

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
they can be classified.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.520
Develop an associative series

51:13.520 --> 51:15.520
and try to

51:15.520 --> 51:17.520
use techniques

51:17.520 --> 51:19.520
that may have never been used

51:19.520 --> 51:21.520
in advertising before.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.520
Your specifics were not used.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.520
Understand this point.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.520
Everything is copied in advertising.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.520
Everything.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.520
And here, as it were,

51:31.520 --> 51:33.520
the secrets and some kind of advertising intelligence,

51:33.520 --> 51:35.520
well, of course, at the stage of development, yes.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.520
At the stage of development

51:37.520 --> 51:39.520
of an advertising campaign, yes.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.520
And this is where advertising, of course, takes place.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.520
But advertising is public.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.520
As soon as you came out with your brand

51:45.520 --> 51:47.520
and advertisement, everything became clear to me.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.520
Everything is clear and what to hide here.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.520
Understand, yes. Therefore, analyze

51:51.520 --> 51:53.520
what you see. Try to

51:53.520 --> 51:55.520
compilation, pardon,

51:55.520 --> 51:57.520
from one and another to find a solution

51:57.520 --> 51:59.520
that no one has ever found before you.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.520
It's not easy.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.520
But the more you look,

52:03.520 --> 52:05.520
the more you see,

52:05.520 --> 52:07.520
the more you try to analyze,

52:07.520 --> 52:09.520
the more chances you have

52:09.520 --> 52:11.520
that you will come to

52:11.520 --> 52:13.520
some kind of good result.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.520
Do not forget that the method of trial and error

52:15.520 --> 52:17.520
it, you will not get away

52:17.520 --> 52:19.520
from it. And far from

52:19.520 --> 52:21.520
always that advertising campaign,

52:21.520 --> 52:23.520
idea, plot that you came up with

52:23.520 --> 52:25.520
and which seems absolutely

52:25.520 --> 52:27.520
ingenious and just has to

52:27.520 --> 52:29.520
promote the masses so that they run

52:29.520 --> 52:31.520
just to your company, called,

52:31.520 --> 52:33.520
tried to buy. It will not work.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.520
Such a sphere that

52:35.520 --> 52:37.520
you will be engaged in here

52:37.520 --> 52:39.520
as if such a person here

52:39.520 --> 52:41.520
as if to exclude it is impossible.

52:41.520 --> 52:43.520
We also talked to you about this.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.520
Therefore, here is what we

52:45.520 --> 52:47.520
you picked up and what we

52:47.520 --> 52:49.520
included in you. We hope that

52:49.520 --> 52:51.520
it will help you, well, let's say so.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.520
A little bit to expand, yes,

52:53.520 --> 52:55.520
vision and approach. See

52:55.520 --> 52:57.520
some tricks, perhaps which

52:57.520 --> 52:59.520
you have not seen. And most importantly, here is what

52:59.520 --> 53:01.520
we call you to do.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.520
Try to play with

53:03.520 --> 53:05.520
my mind. Try to take any,

53:05.520 --> 53:07.520
I say again, yes, any two or three

53:07.520 --> 53:09.520
examples and try to think

53:09.520 --> 53:11.520
how would you improve

53:11.520 --> 53:13.520
these decisions.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.520
What would you add? Maybe some text,

53:15.520 --> 53:17.520
maybe some drawing. This is a training

53:17.520 --> 53:19.520
your mind that

53:19.520 --> 53:21.520
well, absolutely for sure, will not pass

53:21.520 --> 53:23.520
you, will not pass for nothing and

53:23.520 --> 53:25.520
which you will definitely be able

53:25.520 --> 53:27.520
then already in your everyday

53:27.520 --> 53:29.520
work, so to speak, when moving your

53:29.520 --> 53:31.520
brand to use.
