00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.340
My name is Kabaret Valery Viktorovich.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.380
I will teach you the course of financial management.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.580
I am a professor of Moscow Business School.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.340
Today we discuss the financial

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.760
documents of the company.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.940
We will consider two main issues.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.200
First, we will see what financial documents

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.100
are mainly in the company.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.200
Let us look at the main document.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.860
The balance sheet of the enterprise, as

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.220
well as on the second question, we analyze

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.980
the financial statements, which is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.360
visible from financial documents.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.160
So let’s start with our first question.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.640
Financial statements are the set

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.100
of information about the funds

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.280
of the enterprise, the sources of these

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.260
funds and their movement.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.060
The most important question is why do we

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.620
need financial reporting?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.940
Why do all companies in our country

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.520
and any other country in the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.700
world prepare this report?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.160
Who needs it and how much?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.840
Let us think about this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.120
with you.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.240
Who do you think needs financial

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.260
reporting?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.020
Who gets interesting results?

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.150
You are absolutely right.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.750
First of all, financial reporting

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
is needed by the owners of the enterprise.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.970
The owner of the enterprise is the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.730
most interested person in successful

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.350
business.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.830
He is very interested in whether he

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.290
has invested his money correctly,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.610
whether the business he is engaged

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.690
in brings him the most income.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.030
Therefore, the owner of the enterprise

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.090
studies and is ready to consider

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850
every day all the financial

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.730
information that he receives.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.650
The second place in interest

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.930
is the manager who manages

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.890
this enterprise.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.970
More and more managers, the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.530
first persons of the enterprise,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.270
are not the owners

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.630
of the enterprise.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.830
This is a common trend worldwide.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.210
The owners gradually depart from the management

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.230
of the enterprise, transferring the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.010
management to high-level professionals.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.990
A high-level professional

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.650
is interested in the owner

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.230
highly appreciating his work.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.690
What is the evaluation of his work?

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.910
The success of the enterprise.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.590
Therefore, for

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.150
the manager, the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.010
results that the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.890
enterprise achieves

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.570
are the most

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110
important point

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.990
that characterizes

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.690
it.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.110
Who needs financial reporting?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.830
Also right.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.510
You have absolutely rightly noticed

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.210
that financial reporting is needed

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.490
by government agencies.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.270
I draw your attention to the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.610
fact that the state in all countries

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.490
of the world obliges enterprises

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.510
to report and provide this

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.130
report to government bodies.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.830
Among the state bodies, two can be

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.710
distinguished, which are especially interested

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.930
in the financial statements

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.490
of the enterprise.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.250
The first is of course the tax inspection.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.250
The tax inspectorate is responsible

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.170
for collecting taxes, it monitors,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.370
controls the activities

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.990
of enterprises, so working with

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.770
financial statements, receiving

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.910
them, analyzing them is an important

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.950
duty for it.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.830
And the second state

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.730
structure, which is interested

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.970
in financial reporting,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.090
and not only financial,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.210
but also more broadly, is state

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.410
bodies that study statistics

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.630
of both enterprises

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.550
and industries and the whole

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.630
state as a whole.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.890
And therefore, they also need

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.590
accounts that come

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.510
from the company.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.290
I dare assure you that the financial

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.550
statements prepared by enterprises

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.310
in terms of accounting reporting

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.910
are the statements that are

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.590
needed first of all by

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.810
government bodies.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.470
It is designed to make

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.730
the reporting necessary

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.130
for these state structures,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.610
and we will be back

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.870
to this subtle issue

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.690
several times in our

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.050
lectures and mention

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.230
it several times,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.430
but today I am

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.870
making this the most

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.730
important emphasis

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.990
in our material.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.390
Imagine that you are the company

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.710
that invests in the business.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.310
You are very curious about

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.290
how successful the business is done by

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.570
those you invest your capital in.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.890
Therefore, it is very important

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.190
for you to know their financial

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.710
statements, analyze them

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.890
and be sure that the same approach

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.950
is followed by the bankers.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.250
They give loans to companies.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.890
It is very important for them to get

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.850
the loan back.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.950
This is the result of the work of the bankers,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.510
their professionalism.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.350
And in the end, it is their business

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.750
earns on giving out loans.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.010
Therefore, the bankers are

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.610
very careful to whom they

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.550
give loans.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.270
And this is especially important,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.350
because you need to remember that

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.770
loans are primarily interested in

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.770
those who lack money for one or

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.350
another reason.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.710
Therefore, among them may be those

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.130
who already have a very difficult

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.410
financial situation.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.450
They will not even be saved by

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.150
any credit, but they lack Solomenkov.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.950
They are trying to take this loan

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.530
to pull their business out of a difficult

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.810
situation.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.030
Banks are very careful to

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.870
pay back the loan.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.530
The next person interested

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.550
in financial situation are

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.370
business partners.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.010
Imagine that you are doing business,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.170
your company is doing business

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.450
with one or another enterprise.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.670
You jointly build a business,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.290
plan, make purchases,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.210
invest money.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.150
Do you not care how sustainable

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.710
the company you

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.670
will work with is.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.930
If it burns, you will burn

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.470
with it.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.750
We should know the financial position

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.530
of the business partner is a very

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.010
and very important point.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.510
Therefore, before starting large

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.310
projects, you must definitely examine

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.290
your partner’s financial

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.570
situation.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.790
But even if you don’t start

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.610
their joint major projects,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.530
you just take, buy, buy, make

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.830
a commodity or sell goods

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.130
to that enterprise.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.690
After all, you plan your business

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.470
on the basis that your partner

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.270
will constantly make these purchases.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.750
This requires a stable

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.710
financial situation.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.390
Therefore, the interest in financial

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.570
reporting in this case is very even

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.590
appropriate.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.530
And last but not least, the

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.030
interest in the financial statements

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.450
of the enterprise

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.790
is shown by the employees

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.410
themselves.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.510
But not always.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.290
There are cases in the life

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.790
of an enterprise when the enterprise

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.370
has a very difficult financial

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.910
situation, and when it is about to

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.590
become bankrupt, bankrupt,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.390
and then all the employees

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.330
of this enterprise will be

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.690
behind the door.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.650
Most often in this case, employees

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.370
are dismissed without paying

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.950
wages, with many months

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.850
of delay in wages occurring.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.270
Employees are very concerned and

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.730
worried about these cases.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.590
It is very important for them

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.270
to know how sustainable the enterprise

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.790
is, whether it will survive,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.970
whether it will return.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.490
After all, they are patriots, they

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.810
continue to work on their enterprise,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.330
they hope, they believe in this

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.430
enterprise.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.070
They want to know that everything

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.830
is okay in this company.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.670
They are ready every week, every

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.190
day to wonder if we are going

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.170
to be well.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.450
Here we saw with you who needs

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.930
financial reporting in the company.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.490
Thus, financial statements are

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.370
not empty, not naked figures on paper,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.910
and financial statements are business and

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.450
this is the life of a large number of

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.090
people who are connected by business

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.590
lines with this enterprise, that

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.430
is why we need to know financial statements

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.410
to study and understand to be able

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.270
to read to be able to evaluate

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.570
and make relevant conclusions here and

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.610
will be devoted to this and our present

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.570
day lecture with you Now we will

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.790
talk about the financial

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.970
statements itself.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.010
What requirements are presented by all

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.330
the above-mentioned higher persons

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.910
who are interested in studying financial

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.210
statements.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.590
We will list them and discuss the most

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.570
important of them and reveal their content.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.550
Financial statements must be objective.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.310
She must be true.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.750
It should not be a lie, it should not

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.630
be a decoration, because

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.330
everyone studies the financial

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.850
statements and perceives it as

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.270
a pure coin.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.550
It must be absolutely true.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.950
Unfortunately, it should be noted

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.450
that business in our country does

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.990
not always provide objective financial

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.270
statements.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.150
So it has been today business in our

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.590
country that financial reporting

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.910
is being decorated.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.610
It is specially designed for

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.310
tax services.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.890
Moreover, you can even meet such

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.370
an attitude of business managers

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.730
that the financial statements of

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.470
the accounting are made for the

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.130
tax service and the manager

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.410
is not even interested

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.390
in financial statements, so far

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.890
from the real reality.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.170
This bad attitude toward financial

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.330
reporting is the situation that

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.050
needs to be avoided.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.710
Time, of course, will put everything

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.530
in place, the tax time in our

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.830
country will become more or less

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.410
normal, civilized, as in the whole

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.530
world, and our business will

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.630
not escape from taxes, will

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.270
not hide from taxes, but will

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.310
be honest, the laws pay those

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.090
small taxes that must be

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.750
in any civilized country.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.550
Then the financial statements that

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.010
we are talking about will become

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.710
absolutely objective, there

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.550
will be no drop of what is not

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.510
really.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.810
The second requirement of financial

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.710
statements is its neutrality.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.750
It should be irrelevant to the interests

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.250
of one or another business, it is

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.650
neutral, it is such that it is ready

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.510
to be perceived by any entity

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.950
that is interested in financial

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.270
statements.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.670
It reflects the interests of all these actors.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.730
Financial statements should be independent,

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.070
that is, it should be as objective

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.310
as possible and as independent

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.190
as possible from those who prepare

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.170
it.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.850
Recently, there has been a trend

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.390
in our country when accounting

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.530
is transferred to outsourcing.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.750
That is, when there are

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.370
specialized firms that are

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.650
engaged in accounting.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.350
Here it is indeed possible

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.590
to note that if an independent

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.350
firm, which does not obey

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.410
the owner of the enterprise

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.030
it serves, nor its

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.970
CEO, keeps accounting,

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.090
then this accounting

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.830
is more independent of

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:50.650
the will of the outlet.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.570
Therefore, it is more objective,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:56.530
it is more accurate in reflecting

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.130
information.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.410
The next requirement for reporting

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.790
is comparability.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.010
Why do we need comparison?

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.270
The fact is that the reporting we

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.010
are talking about is not necessary

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.290
in itself.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.610
It is not necessary to put it on

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.110
the shelves, and it was lying

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.810
there, dusting, and so on.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.010
Reporting is necessary to analyze,

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.770
compare different enterprises

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.890
or within the same enterprise different

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.750
periods of its business, compare

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.350
different countries with each

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.250
other, consider the development

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.730
of our own country, in which

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.190
we live from the point

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.730
of view of business.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.890
But in order to do all this, all

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.790
reports must be similar, comparable.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.750
In this case, they can easily

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.510
be compared to each other.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.430
Financial statements should be periodic,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.670
it can not be published every

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.210
day, this is not necessary,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.290
because the preparation

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.430
of this report requires a large

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.970
effort of the employees who

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.630
prepare it.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.770
But it can not go out at the

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.850
same time over very long periods

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.410
of time, say once every 10

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.210
years.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.790
The fact is that making management

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.770
decisions once every 10 years

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.310
is pointless.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.170
Anything can happen to the company

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.790
in 10 years, it may not survive

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.650
until the next financial

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.910
statements.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.210
There is a certain optimal

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.650
regime in which financial

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.490
statements are prepared.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.450
Financial reports are

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.770
made once a quarter, that

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.210
is, four times a year.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.890
Annual financial statements are

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.030
made for the year.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.730
The next requirement is full coverage.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.850
Financial statements should take

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.250
into account all the costs that

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.950
the entity has incurred that are

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.450
necessary to obtain the pain

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.150
of the results that it has achieved.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.610
It should cover everything, reflect

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.270
everything and show all the operations

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.390
that took place at the enterprise.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.810
Do not leave anything on board.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.230
Financial reporting and shadow

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.430
economy, as we see, are incompatible.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.530
Because one presupposes the absence

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.270
of the other.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.550
Financial statements must be reliable.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.850
The information contained

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.930
in it must be true, must be

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.190
understandable, it must arouse

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.290
trust.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.210
Moreover, the information that

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.390
is considered in the financial

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.730
statements should not

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.930
be unlimited.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.350
It should be narrowed to the level

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.790
that is necessary to understand

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.510
the real financial condition

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.230
of the enterprise.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.190
This is stated in the following quality

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.390
that is presented to the financial

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.410
statements.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.330
That is its substance.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.090
Only the essential points should

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.670
be financial statements.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.470
What does the annual financial

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.730
report include?

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.510
Financial reports prepare accounting.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.610
Annual financial statements include

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.130
the following forms, which are

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.270
presented to you on the slide.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.710
Accounting is the form number one.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.510
Profit and Loss Report is form number

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.230
two.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.610
Form 3 report on capital changes,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.230
form 4 report on cash

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.570
flow, form 5 report on

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.230
balance sheet, explanatory

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.310
note, which analyzes the

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.630
factors that led to the company’

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.810
s performance, and

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.370
the final part of the audit

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.210
report in cases where

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.270
this audit report

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.510
is mandatory for

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.330
the company.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.450
Now we will look at the main

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.910
document of financial statements

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.270
in more detail - the

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.650
balance sheet.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.850
In general, before studying

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.530
the accounting balance sheet,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.930
I recommend you to keep

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.130
it in your hands.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.510
That is, one thing to study

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.770
it theoretically, and another

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.010
thing to see it before yourself.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.250
In the slide that is right before you,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.890
you can see a general example

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.190
of the balance sheet.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.910
It consists of two parts, the left and

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.710
the right.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.150
We will talk about this now in

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.210
detail, but most importantly,

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.470
that such a accounting balance

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.710
sheet must be supported by you.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.810
Use your own business.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.170
It will not be uninteresting for

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.130
you to know how your business develops.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.890
The balance sheet is an

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.490
open document, no one

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.750
hides it.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.390
This document is provided to those

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.630
who request it.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.230
You can go to your accounting

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.750
office and say that by studying the

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.730
course of financial management

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.890
and preparing to become a high-

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.630
end financier or head of enterprise

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.570
who understands the activities of

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.710
the enterprise and will

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.190
manage them very high quality,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.910
this requires you to study

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.130
the accounting balance sheet.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.250
No one will refuse you.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.530
You will receive a balance sheet

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.370
and you will carefully study it,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.870
read it, understand and

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.990
see a mass of useful information.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.170
What does the accounting

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.930
balance sheet contain?

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.650
The left and right column, the left

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.850
column, the right column.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.630
The left column shows the assets of

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.010
the enterprise, then the enterprise,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.090
structured by composition and

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.050
direction of their use.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.470
The right side of the balance sheet is the

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.270
same resources, but only

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.790
structured according to the sources of their financing.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.090
The left and right side are to be taken into account.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.370
These are the same resources of the

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.850
enterprise, but the cuts of these resources

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.270
are different.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.250
One cut reflects the direction

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.030
of use, and the other cut

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.570
indicates the sources of these

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.410
resources.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.790
Where did these resources come from

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.850
and where they were directed?

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.650
You see how simple it is in

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.350
this accounting balance.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.770
Nothing is complicated.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.130
The following requirement

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.690
is met in the balance sheet.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.350
Since these are the same

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.310
resources as in the left and the

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.610
right, the balance sheet of the

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.690
left is equal to the balance

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.430
sheet of the right.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.430
They are the same resources.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.910
On the left side of the assets, on the right side

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.010
of the passives.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.010
Therefore, it is safe to assert that the

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.570
sum of all assets of the enterprise is equal

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.690
to the sum of all liabilities of the enterprise.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.590
Enterprise passives are

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.390
the sources of financial enterprises.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.490
It consists of two blocks.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.490
own capital of the company.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.850
The main source of capital in the company.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.390
His own resources, plus his obligations.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.450
The company has

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.390
to borrow some money.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.750
So, equal assets are equal to assets,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.050
equal liabilities are equal to

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.930
assets, and equal assets are equal

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.470
to the sum of equal assets and liabilities.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.690
This condition is fulfilled

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.470
for accounting to understand,

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.230
understand what it consists of,

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.430
why there are certain lines written,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.430
why and why they are written

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.870
there in one or another order.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.750
There is nothing accidental in balance,

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.670
nothing chaotic.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.010
It has the enormous logic of the financiers

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.990
who prepared this balance sheet.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.070
The assets of the company in the balance

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.910
sheet are grouped by their liquidity.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.050
Liquidity means the ability

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:50.090
to convert resources into money.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.870
The more liquid the resource, the

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.130
easier, the faster it becomes a

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.790
form of money.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.950
The most liquid resource

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.990
is money itself.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.710
They become very easily themselves.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.370


00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.630
All the rest requires a

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:18.590
longer time to convert these

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.790
resources into money.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.770
The asset lines are recorded from top to bottom

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.650
in terms of the degree of increased liquidity.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.570
The top line is the least

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.050
liquid assets, the bottom

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.470
line is the fastest liquid

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.710
assets.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.550
So, from top to bottom in terms of the

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.930
level of liquidity increases.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.510
The assets are divided into two blocks.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.730
The first is long-term assets, they are

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.130
located at the top of the balance

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.750
sheet, you see them in front of you,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.850
and at the bottom are short-term

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.550
assets that live in a shorter

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.070
period than long-term assets.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.890
In the balance sheet they are

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.950
also called non-currency funds and currency funds.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.170
Long-term assets are used for more

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.250
than one reporting period.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.590
As you may remember, we have already

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.830
told you that the reporting period

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.790
of the financial statements is one

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.090
year, and those assets that are

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.950
used for more than one year that,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.170
in participating in the production

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.930
process, move their value slowly,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.730
through amortization for more

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.610
than one year, are long-term assets.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.450
There are short-term

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.690
assets whose life span is

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.930
less than one reporting period.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.790
As for the liabilities that are shown on

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.410
the right side of the balance sheet, they

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.510
are grouped by the urgency of the repayment

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.130
of obligations.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.910
Again, the upward downward movement

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.390
from those obligations that are longer

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.830
in terms of repayment periods to

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.030
those that are shortest in terms

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.250
of repayment periods.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.510
That is why the top line of the

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.930
liability is own funds, the

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.810
established capital of the enterprise.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.390
This is what is expected

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.570
to return to the

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.710
last.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.210
And in the best case,

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.330
if the companies will

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.730
work long, long, long and

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.410
never return.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.550
This will continue as

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.450
long as the company exists.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.710
If we look at assets with

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.710
you, we will see that the working

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.410
assets, those that serve

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.610
less than one reporting

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:58.930
period, include stocks,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.610
debit debt, short-

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.810
term financial investment

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.670
and cash.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.150
We have already said that

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.630
the money is not accidental,

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.030
it is in the bottom line.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.890
They have the highest liquidity,

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.130
they already have cash.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.570
Following them by the rate

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.030
of conversion into cash is

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.310
short-term financial investment.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:23.790
These are the money you invested

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.130
in a very short period of time.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.310
Maybe you gave them.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.450
They will soon be returned

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.670
in cash.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.430
They are therefore slightly higher

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.390
than the money.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.190
Then there is debt.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.010
Debit debt, these funds

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.230
that you have to return

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.510
but have not yet been returned.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.010
We will talk to you a little later today.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.790
In the case of debt and credit

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.590
we will deal with this in

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.530
more detail.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.990
Now let’s say there are still

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.150
stocks.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.230
This is the top line of

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.730
operating assets.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.090
Stock is what a company

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.890
needs to function normally.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.610
The point is that if the enterprise

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.930
does not have inventories, the

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.330
enterprise risks to disrupt

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.030
the rhythm of its work.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.850
The enterprise must work figuratively,

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.850
like a clock, rhythmically, minute

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.550
by minute.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.910
This is the production cycle.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.250
But, unfortunately,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.360
there is a reality, a

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.880
reality that is connected with

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.240
the actions of other companies,

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.200
related to which raw materials

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.500
are purchased.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.240
There is an electricity supply,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.680
which can also be unstable,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.860
sometimes can be disconnected,

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.400
interrupted.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.300
There are employees of the enterprise

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.440
who are also people alive who sometimes

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.520
go on vacation.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.440
They are also not at work

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.920
during this period.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.300
Sometimes they get sick, sometimes

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.680
they take care of children.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.340
This is also a disruption

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.800
of the production process,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.360
a violation of rhythm.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.900
But a violation of rhythm for the

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.160
enterprise is a painful phenomenon.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.260
The fact is that the enterprise,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.060
again, is not on its own, not

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.660
on the moon, not separated from

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.720
the real reality.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.980
This enterprise is linked to a huge

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.940
number of contractual deliveries with

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.400
other enterprises, which are waiting

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.840
for the delivered products.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.380
And the fact that the rhythm

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.220
is disrupted in the enterprise and

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.360
it cannot provide the supply of

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.140
this product on time leads to

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.920
failure of other enterprises.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.280
They have their own rhythm.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.680
But no one wants to deal with

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.200
irritmic business.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.480
with business unpredictable,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.020
which can be interrupted, breach the contract.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.480
This is uncomfortable for business.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.740
Therefore, an enterprise

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.420
that breaks the rhythm of its

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.340
work is not very profitable

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.360
as a partner.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.320
Not everyone wants to deal with him.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.220
Not everyone wants to trust

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.860
his finances or invest

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.040
in this enterprise.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.460
Unfortunately, companies have

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.000
to have stock.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.080
And with the help of stocks to ensure

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.520
the rhythm of their work.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.510


00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.610
Yes, stocks require a certain depletion

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.130
of resources, a certain

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.390
additional expenditure

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.770
of funds.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.970
These stocks need to be stored.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.830
These warehouses need to be stored.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.410
And only when there are warehouses

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.550
with components, normal rhythmic

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.670
work will be done.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.110
But these are additional costs.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.110
But unfortunately, these additional costs

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.270
must be borne by enterprises, then

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.350
they will ensure the rhythm of work.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.470
In our country, and not only in

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.730
our country, it has not yet been possible

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.430
to such a degree of support of rhythm

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.410
that it could be done without

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.290
inventories, so that it could be made

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.430
direct deliveries, components for

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.770
the enterprise, and the enterprise

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.470
would not need warehouses,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.290
would not need inventories.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.190
The only country that

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.570
has taken this opportunity

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.330
is Japan.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.110
Just in Time system provides Japan with the

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.870
supply of components directly from

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.890
the wheels to the enterprise where they

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.070
are sold in the production process.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:59.670
No need for stock and warehouses.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.910
No other country has been able to

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.670
repeat Japan’s characteristics.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.550
It is probably related to

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.110
the mentality of Japanese business.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.290
Japan is also a territorial

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.210
small country.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:17.970
Very small.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.390
Compare Russia and Japan.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.910
Imagine the vast Russia

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.690
and small Japan

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.330
on the map.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.910
Now, for comparison, these

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.810
two countries have roughly

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.590
the same population.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.410
The vast Russia and small in the territory

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.130
of Japan and this small size

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.310
of the territory created the potential

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.870
for the rapid delivery of components

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.770
from one company to another can be

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.950
only worth the way to move and

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.570
delivery has already been carried

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.710
out this is one of the reasons why

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.050
in Japan managed to implement

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:09.870
a system without warehouses at firms.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.570
However, in our country, with its

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.230
vast spaces, and often

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.930
with the non-obligation

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:24.930
of subjects, stocks are simply vital.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.810
There are inventories, there is rhythm,

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.610
there is excellent work and there

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.670
is support for good relationships between.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.060
The next point we will

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.320
talk about is the

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.900
debts that exist in the

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.840
company.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.520
The company has

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.440
two types of debt:

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.940
debt and credit.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.540
Debit debt is the funds that

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.140
are due to the enterprise,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.120
but not received by this

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.420
enterprise.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.180
Per the company carries out the shipment

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.720
of goods and provides the so-

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.500
called commodity credit.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.800
This is especially common in

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.380
trade.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.500
The trade enterprise tries to get

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.600
the goods without money, with a

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.480
payment time, in order to return

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.300
the money after the sale of this goods.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.020
Producers also

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.440
have debt.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.200
They owe more and

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.620
more money.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.260
But we must understand that

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.140
no company can always give

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.120
away its products without

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.400
receiving money back.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.060
Otherwise, it will stop

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.680
working and stop working.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.940
All in moderation.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.840
For this reason, every company

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.460
in the country, as in the

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.300
world, strives to avoid

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.700
high debt debt.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.220
Yes, all companies agree

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.360
to ship goods to reliable partners,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.460
but a little, for a short time

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.860
and necessarily with a refund.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.880
In the enterprises even a whole

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.140
policy for the repayment of

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.940
debt debt is carried out.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.660
There are employees

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.820
whose functional duty

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.860
is to take care of the

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.460
repayment of debt.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.000
They call the counterparts,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.220
they talk to them daily, they

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.480
persuade them, beg, ask.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.360
Then, in order order, they are

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.900
asked to return the money.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.560
And in the extreme case,

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.160
when absolutely nothing is resolved,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.500
they turn to the legal authorities

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:57.240
in a arbitration, which can

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.740
force the enterprise to return

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.360
the funds, and may recognize

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.240
it bankrupt if it can

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.300
not return these funds

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.000
at all.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.880
Appeal to legal bodies is

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.020
the most reliable, most effective,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.360
although the last remedy.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.480
In addition to debt, the

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.520
company has a credit debt.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.880
Credit debt is a clever

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.820
debt.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.700
This is what you should and don’

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.760
t want to return it for some reason.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.320
The most common reason is nothing

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.460
to return.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.640
Yes, I have a debt, but I have nothing to pay back.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.480
You have to explain to your partners

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.500
that you are a reliable partner, that

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.140
you will definitely return these things

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.360
right now, and you will immediately

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.200
calculate, but you can not

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.360
return them yet.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.320
Often before the product you

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.680
have received.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.400
When you sell the product,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.880
you will have money

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.540
to repay the debt.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.720
But sometimes the enterprise

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.360
abuses its creditorship,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.200
and even when they have cash,

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.360
and when it develops very quickly,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.680
very rapidly, they are

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.020
progressing in their development,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.080
they try not to return it.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.780
In this case, it works negatively.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.800
The fact is that the repayment

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.700
of creditors’ debt is like a card

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.160
debt, it is a matter of honor.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.240
If the enterprise returns

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.840
on time, it is trusted, and it

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.180
can continue to receive creditorship.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.660
If they see that the enterprise

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.280
has a normal financial position,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.940
that it has money, it

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.920
buys products, it offers

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.420
products to everyone, but

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.860
does not want to return the

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.440
creditors' debt, the enterprise

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.400
loses confidence.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.600
They do not want to work with him, realizing

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.680
that this company is abusing the

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.000
trust of its partners.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.820
Therefore, the credit debt is

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.600
both sharp weapons, like a shave.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.520
Yes, almost all have

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.680
credit debt, but this

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.980
cannot be abused.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.920
And at the first opportunity, when

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.780
you have a financial improvement

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.160
in the business, the credit

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.680
debt, at least partially, even

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.500
your most important business

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.420
partner, should be returned.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.200
Your trust will be much higher.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.400
Now we will talk about money.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.800
We said that the lowest

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.220
line of an asset is money.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.180
Why does the company need money?

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.860
You will say, you have to

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.960
pay the salary.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.380
Second, you need to buy

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.520
components, carry out the

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.260
production process and sell products.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.980
That is, without money you

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.340
can never do.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.800
This is, on the one hand, and therefore,

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.680
money, from this point of view, the

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.440
enterprise is necessary and necessary.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.500
Imagine that the company

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.740
has no funds.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.180
A serious case.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.940
The company has nothing

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.440
to pay employees.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.900
But in our country, at least

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.660
the lion’s share of the population

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.620
lives from salary to salary.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.860
Therefore, as soon as

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.600
the delay in wages begins,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.460
it affects the employee’

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.300
s condition, including that

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.020
they begin to look for a

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.860
new job.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.800
So, there is a possibility of losing

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.900
reliable, proven, necessary personnel

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.620
for the company.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.720
Not only is it that if a person does not

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.300
receive a salary for a long time, his thoughts

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.340
are not about work, but his thoughts about

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.580
how to survive in this situation.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.640
In other words, the company

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.480
is losing its employees.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.080
If it does not have funds, the

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.320
company cannot calculate its

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.200
counterparties.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.540
You have done your job and

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.140
you cannot pay for it.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.280
Who will do the job for you the

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.160
second time?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.120
That is, we see that the

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.860
enterprise needs money to

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.320
function normally, just

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.320
to function normally.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.560
And if the enterprise still

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.020
wants to develop, if it wants

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.500
to produce more and more

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.840
products, it needs money

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.400
to hire new employees, to

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.600
conclude new contracts, to

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.960
purchase new products,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.280
to build new workshops,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.200
to buy new equipment, all

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.320
this without cash is

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.120
impossible to.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.560
Yes, you will say, money is

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.080
needed, why then do so many

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.880
companies have no money?

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.020
Why then this credit debt,

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.220
which we and you have just

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.160
talked about, which makes

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.420
the enterprise function

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.560
for other people’s money.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.920
The point is that there is,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.280
unfortunately, a phenomenon

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.480
like inflation, which devalues

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.860
the money that is on

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.660
the company’s account.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.120
Inflation eats a certain

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.640
portion of money every day.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.400
The higher the inflation

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.440
rate, the more money is lost,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.020
devalued, devalued, devalued.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.020
This year, according to the forecast,

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.360
an inflation rate of 8% is expected.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.940
This means that in a year 8% of the company’

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.960
s cash funds will disappear, simply

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.080
dissolve due to the fact that there

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.180
is inflation.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.960
But if money is held in a different form,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.720
for example, in the form of the same

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.940
component reserves, then in

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.080
a year with inflation, the prices of

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.940
these reserves will rise.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.700
And we see with you that instead of disvalueing

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.180
money we will get an increase in the

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.060
cost of inventories.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.160
The financials of the enterprise will

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.120
not only not decrease, but they will

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.640
remain, because we did not hold them

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.060
in cash, but in the form of a stock.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.180
And this presence of inflation pushes

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.820
the enterprise to get rid

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.720
of money, not to hold them, to

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.880
release them into circulation

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.280
as quickly as possible.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.720
Today got money, today

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.760
immediately and let go let the

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.460
better stock be better let it be

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.940
better to complete that

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.520
this inflation struggle is

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.660
a wonderful struggle against inflation

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.340
and those who use this tool

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.140
they save their money does

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.900
not lose on inflation but

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.660
unfortunately we just said that

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.880
if the company money is

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.820
not then other problems

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.940
arise and all the work to

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:15.440
balance between these two

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.480
extremes.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.400
On the one hand, to save money

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.000
from inflation, and on the other

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.540
hand, to have the necessary

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.180
cash that would allow the

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.840
enterprise to work rhythmically,

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.140
and to pay wages on

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.400
time and develop.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.020
Here is the task of finding this line

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.660
and the task of financiers, including you,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.440
the students who are studying this course.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.980
Financial management is just one of

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.560
its tasks to teach how to properly

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.900
distribute the finances of the enterprise

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.440
in order to optimally ensure the optimal

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.580
operation of the enterprise if we

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.640
look at the assets then we

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.740
will see that in the top of the

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.440
asset there are non-volatile assets

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.000
if the operating assets

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.160
participate once during the reporting

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.500
period, then non-volatile assets

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.160
participate multiple times

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.760
during the reporting period,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.160
during the year.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.520
That is, this includes, look at

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.020
the slide that is presented

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.220
to you, intangible assets, assets,

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.500
unfinished construction, long-

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.600
term financial investment,

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.200
other non-currency

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.260
assets.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.500
To imagine them in a clear

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.820
way, immediately imagine

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.700
what are the buildings,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.220
structures and equipment

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.960
that are in the enterprise.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.240


00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.440
This is a workshop that is

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.700
built and will serve this enterprise

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.740
for decades.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.100
Not one year, but decades.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.500
This is a equipment that is

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.340
purchased, which will also serve

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.540
for many, many years.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.320
They are not material assets.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.340
That is, not material assets, but

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.140
assets that can bring income

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.080
to the enterprise.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.160
For example, licenses, patents,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.720
trademarks, trademarks.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.740
This is all that a business needs, this

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.640
is what the company builds its business

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.400
on.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.620
Long-term financial investment is an investment

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.680
of an enterprise in other enterprises

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.380
in the form of loans.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.360
Yes, sometimes companies lend money

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.480
to each other.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.300
When it is borrowed from banks, it is

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.860
a loan, and when it is borrowed from

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.120
another enterprise, it is loans.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.140
On these loans, enterprises

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.020
receive interest, which is

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.660
the income of these enterprises.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.560
Sometimes a loan is

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.300
granted without interest

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.300
for joint venture, but in any case,

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.700
these are funds that are invested

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.780
to carry out a particular

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.980
business.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.680
Now let us look at the passive,

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.220
the right side of the balance.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.060
The right part of the balance sheet

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.760
we have already said today with you

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.160
this passive is the sources of the resources

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.260
of the enterprise, the passive responds

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.640
to us where the money came from where

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.580
the enterprise these resources as it received

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.060
them and looking at the right part of

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.320
the balance sheet we see where

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.720
the enterprise has these resources

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.820
first of all from above without considering

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.820
we see that there is own capital.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.780
That is, the enterprise, which is

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.260
the property of the enterprise itself.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.600
In principle, it is the charter capital

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.320
that the enterprise contributed

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.060
during the formation and creation

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.240
of this enterprise and could

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.960
gradually increase the charter

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.000
capital as it exists.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.020
The company needs the authorized capital

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.400
to start functioning, and

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.340
over time the authorized capital

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.720
increases, and the larger the amount

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.260
of the authorized capital, the

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.160
more important this enterprise

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.720
is in the market.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.120
You probably know that the

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.280
minimum amount of the authorized

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.540
capital is 10 thousand rubles.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.580
Please tell me, can at least

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.620
one company function normally

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.160
with only 10 thousand

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:20.960
rubles?

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:21.780
No is.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.800
Only the company can register

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.580
for this money.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:26.820
No more.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.400
And all this amount at the time of registration

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.100
you will be taken by banks for the fact

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.140
that they opened your accounts and

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.140
work with you.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.800
And by the time you start operating

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.220
as a business, you will not

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.080
be in the account.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.480
But in fact, this chartered

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.040
capital is very little.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.500
And when the company says, what is the

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.860
amount of the authorized capital?

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.800
10 thousand rubles?

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.100
You are such

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.820
a small business.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:58.400
The same is the attitude to you and

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.160
when they say that you have many

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.300
million and even billions of

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.680
charter capital you are very reliable

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.540
not by chance so the requirements

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.980
to the minimum amount of the minimum

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.140
amount of the current Russian

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.140
banks 5 million euros, 5 million euros,

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.340
this is already solid although

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.640
minimal but it already means that

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.820
this bank can be trusted and if

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.360
there were only 10 thousand

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.180
rubles, then the trust in such

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.620
a bank, probably, would

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.640
be absent completely.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.720
In addition to the equity, which

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.680
we discussed with you now, the

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.420
liabilities of the company are

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.460
long-term and short-term liabilities.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.100
The company operates modernly

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.740
not only at the expense of

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.060
its own funds, but often not

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.220
only at the expense of its own

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.480
funds, but also at the expense

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.140
of borrowed funds that

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.200
it receives on the market.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.300
What are the main forms

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.020
of loan?

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.560
First of all, it is loans.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.220
An enterprise that can provide

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.260
collateral, which is a normal

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.460
functionary, reveals financial

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.500
stability, for such

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.760
an enterprise it is not

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.120
a great deal of difficulty to

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.180
get a loan in the bank.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.960
Today, the banking sector

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.040
is quite developed and

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.960
you can apply to a huge number

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.140
of banks for loan.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.460
The main conditions for obtaining a loan

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.680
are financial stability and the availability

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.420
of collateral from the company itself.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.360
Unfortunately, large loans are

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.900
attempted by companies when they

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.740
are not already meeting these

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.000
conditions.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.380
Banks can’t help anything.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.760
The business relationship with credit

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.720
should be this.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.000
Credit is not a lifecycle, but

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.340
a way to develop a business.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.120
If you approach this in this

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.620
way, then the loan is needed

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.220
for a successful

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.740
business to develop even faster.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.620
Banks are happy to meet.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.100
And the company itself easily

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.480
processes this loan, earns

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.500
a profit and shares it with the

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.000
banks that gave them a loan.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.400
In addition to the loan, there

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.880
is also a loan.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.120
Loan, as I told you today,

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.140
is the same loan, but only

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.120
received not from the bank,

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.440
but from another company

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.760
that is in some good

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.820
business partnership with you.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.820
He borrows money, you

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.160
borrow money.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.680
It is almost the same loan, only the

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.200
loan is different in that it does not

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.660
need a collateral.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.100
Loans are made between under trust.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.940
If we trust each other as business

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.640
partners, we lend each other

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.960
money for we are doing

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.600
business together.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.780
This is the difference between loans and loans.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.140
This is also seen in

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.620
Muslim banks.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.380
It is not uninteresting to know

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.000
that Muslim banks are different from

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.660
those that have developed

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.460
in the Christian world.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:39.720
Muslim banks are bound in such a

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.600
way that they do not violate the terms

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.040
of the Qur’an.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:51.420
The Qur’an prohibits taking interest

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.280
on the money provided.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.440
The whole banking world is built on

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.460
the fact that the bank earns a percentage

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.300
on what it gives out.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.400
This contradiction for a very long time

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.880
did not allow the opportunity

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.100
to appear a Muslim bank and only the

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.020
search of businessmen themselves in the

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.800
Muslim world about how on the one hand

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.680
not to break the Qur’an and on the other

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.240
hand to function as a bank came to

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.300
the fact that Muslim banks do not

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.380
issue a loan and when they are approached

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.360
they jointly with the company participate

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.300
in the business they return not a percentage

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.440
and share the profits earned in this

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.480
project with them, and

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.300
if the profit is not earned,

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.300
then they do not return, and if

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.100
they suffered a loss, then they

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.980
jointly suffered a loss,

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.240
the risk too on two.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.640
This is the difference between

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.320
Muslim banks and the banks we are

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.060
used to dealing with in our country.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.000
There are no Muslim banks

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.320
in our country.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.680
But if you, as a financier, are going

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.080
to work in Muslim countries, such

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.800
as the Arab Emirates, remember that

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.240
there banks function

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.700
in a different mode than we are

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.540
used to working with our banks.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.320
In addition to loans and

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.180
loans, the company attracts

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.880
funds by placing bonds and bills.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.980
Sometimes you have to pay, but there is

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.460
no money.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.560
No money.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.740
We have already said that companies

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.980
in the struggle against inflation, they

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.780
clamp their belts stronger and have zero

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.060
on their accounts.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.980
And with the partner you have

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.660
to pay, in order to continue to

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.620
work normally.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:44.940
What to do?

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.880
There is a bill for that.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.500
A bill can be paid.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.720
It is a debt receipt that the

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.780
company independently issued

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.980
in a certain form, giving its

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.980
partner the right to demand

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.360
the amount of money

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.500
due to it after a certain

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.840
period.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.340
A Vexel can live its

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:10.960
own life, it can move

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.720
from one business from

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.120
one enterprise to another.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.980
And the trust in the bill is determined

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.300
by the trust in the person who

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.900
issued the bill.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.260
If the bill has been issued by an

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.500
absolutely reliable enterprise, this

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.460
bill lives in a full financial life.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.420
Everyone trusts him, and he is

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.840
not different in essence from money.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.840
Not only that, the bill also brings a percentage.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.520
But if you have already borrowed all

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.700
the loans that could be on the market, that

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.480
is, all the banks have already issued you,

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.680
no one is giving you anymore, well, the

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.320
collateral has expired, all the

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.580
collateral has expired, no one will

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.780
give you a loan anymore.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.700
All you can have already bet.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.460
Everyone who agrees to take the bill

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.940
you have already issued them and

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.420
you want to still develop the business

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.340
growing and developing the

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.840
necessary funds to develop,

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.500
then the company resorted to bonds

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.080
issuing bonds this is a securities

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.880
that companies in a special

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.120
way designated and placed on

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.500
the market Bonds are purchased

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.540
by everyone who would like

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.640
to buy.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.400
Bonds are paid more percentage

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.340
than companies that

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.540
place deposits in banks.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.260
This is a more profitable investment

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.880
from a financial point of view, although

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.760
more risky.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.580
Banks are usually more reliable than

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.900
buying bonds.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.720
But there is a very important point

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.180
here – buy tea bonds.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:48.520
If you buy bonds from a large, reliable

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.340
company, then be sure that these

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.400
bonds are 100% reliable, and you

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.520
get your interest, and it

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.880
will be greater, better, better,

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.340
more reliable than placing

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.960
that money in the bank, or, even

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.260
more than just keeping on your

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.960
account where the account is

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.840
overwhelmed by inflation.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.740
All of these instruments I have

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.220
listed are long-term liabilities,

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.860
that is, they are valid for

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.280
a period of more than

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:21.960
one year.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.000
But these same tools can be

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.260
used for a period of less than

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.800
one year, you can get a loan for

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.540
a period of less than one

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.960
year, such as overdraft,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.140
a common loan, the essence

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.800
of which is that each month

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.760
you must report to the bank

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.220
that you are able to repay

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:47.080
the amount issued to you.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.820
You must have the same amount on

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.680
your account that you received

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.200
from the bank.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.960
And if the rate of capital turnover

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.100
in your business is very high,

00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.280
for example, you can make

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.660
several capital turnover in

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.100
a month, for you, overdraft

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.520
is the best loan.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.900
This loan is suitable for commercial

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.140
enterprises, in the first place.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.680
The characteristic is that it does not

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.680
require a bet.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.300
The most deterrent factor in getting

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.780
a loan is always a collateral, especially

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.600
in our Russian business, where

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.580
our firms usually grow from

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.020
scratch, that is, nothing.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.240
And overdraft is not required,

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.940
so for trading enterprises

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.240
or for with capital turnover

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.880
less than one month,

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.020
overdraft is the ideal

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.280
loan.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.520
Think about if you have your own business,

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.180
what is the duration of capital

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.940
turnover of your business?

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:49.160
If it is less than a month, go to

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.180
the bank and say that you want

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.600
to get an overdraft loan.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.700
Be sure that this loan will be

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.280
the most beneficial for you.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.220
In addition to loans less than one year,

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.600
there are also bills that are issued

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.080
for less than one year.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.280
Bonds may be issued for a period

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.440
of less than one year.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.680
In this case, all these sources of

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.720
funds are short-term liabilities

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.300
and in the corresponding

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.140
line of liability they are reflected,

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.600
are the source of the operation

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.620
of the enterprise.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.940
Here we and you have considered the balance

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.280
sheet of the enterprise, assessed, seen

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.280
its lines, understood how it is formed,

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.160
from what sources it is formed and for

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.640
what purposes it is spent.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.380
Passive assets and balance sheets.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.780
The balance sheet is the most important

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.740
financial document of the company.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.840
The best financial and accountants

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.580
of the company work over the balance sheet.
