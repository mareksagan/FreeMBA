00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
My name is Valery Kapsar. I will read you a course on financial management. I am a professor at the Moscow Business School.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Today's topic is the financial documents of the enterprise.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We will consider two main questions.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
The first one is to see what financial documents are the main ones at the enterprise.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
We will consider the main document, the enterprise balance.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
And the second question is to analyze the financial accounting, which is seen from the financial documents.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
So, let's start with our first question.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
Financial accounting is a collection of information about the funds of the enterprise, the sources of these funds and their movements.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
The main question is why do we need financial accounting?

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Why do all enterprises in our country and in any other country of the world prepare this accounting?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Who needs it and how much?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's think about this question together.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
Who needs financial accounting? Who gets interesting results from it?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You are absolutely right.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
First of all, the enterprise owner needs financial accounting.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
The enterprise owner is the most interested person in the successful business.

01:44.000 --> 01:55.000
He is very interested in whether he invested his money correctly, whether he is doing a business that brings him the most income.

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
Therefore, the enterprise owner studies and is ready to consider all the financial information that he receives every day.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The second most interested person is the manager who manages the enterprise.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
Currently, more and more managers, the first members of the enterprise, are not the owners of the enterprise.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
This is a common trend all over the world.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The owners gradually leave the management of the enterprise, transferring the management to high-level professionals.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
A high-level professional is interested in the fact that the owner highly appreciates his work.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
What is the assessment of his work? The success of the enterprise.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
Therefore, for the manager, the results that the enterprise achieves are the most important point that characterizes his activity.

02:52.000 --> 03:02.000
Therefore, the manager draws financial information, studies it, and makes management decisions to make the enterprise work even better.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Who else needs financial accounting?

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
You are absolutely right to notice that financial accounting is needed by the state structure.

03:14.000 --> 03:27.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the state in all countries of the world obliges the enterprise to provide financial accounting to the state bodies.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
There are two state bodies that are particularly interested in financial accounting.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
The first is the Tax Inspection.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
The Tax Inspection is responsible for the collection of taxes, it monitors the enterprise's activities,

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
and therefore it is the most important responsibility to work with financial accounting, to receive it, to analyze it.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
The second state body that is interested in financial accounting, not only financial, but in a broader sense,

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
is the State Bodies, which study the statistics of the enterprise, the industry, and the state as a whole.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Therefore, they also need the accounting that comes from the enterprise.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
I dare to assure you that the accounting that the enterprise prepares, in terms of accounting for the accounting,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
is the accounting that is primarily needed by the state bodies.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
It is designed to be the accounting that is needed for these state bodies.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
We will return to this question several times in our lectures, and mention it several times,

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
but today I am focusing on this most important point in our material.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
The next people who need to know the financial accounting of the enterprise are investors and creditors.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Imagine that you are the company that invests in the enterprise.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
You are very interested in how successfully those who invest their capital are doing business.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
It is very important for you to know their financial accounting, to analyze it,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
and to be sure that the invested funds will return to you in a hundred percent.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
The same approach is pursued by bankers.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
They issue loans to enterprises, and it is very important for them to get the loan back.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
This is the result of the bankers' work, their professionalism,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
and, in the end, it is their business to earn money by issuing loans.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Therefore, bankers are very careful about who they give loans to.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
It is especially important, because you need to remember that loans are primarily used by those

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
who do not have enough money for one reason or another.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Therefore, there can be those who already have a very difficult financial situation.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
They will not be able to save a single loan, but they will grab the straw and try to get it back

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
in order to pull their enterprise out of a difficult situation.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
Bankers are very careful about giving loans only to those who are able to return it.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
The next people who are interested in the financial situation are business partners.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
Imagine that you run a business, your enterprise runs a business with a particular enterprise.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
You jointly build a business, plan, make purchases, invest money.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Aren't you interested in how stable the enterprise you work with is?

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
If it burns, you will burn as well.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
It is very important to know the financial situation of your business partner.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
Therefore, before starting a large project, you must study the financial situation of your partner.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But even if you do not start a joint large project,

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
but you just buy, make purchases, or sell goods to this enterprise,

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
because you plan your business based on the fact that your partner will constantly make these purchases,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
you need a stable financial situation for this.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Therefore, the interest in financial accountability is very appropriate.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
And the last place, although not the last in importance,

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
is the interest in the financial accountability of the enterprise.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
This is shown by the employees of this enterprise.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But not always.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
There are cases in the life of an enterprise when it has a very difficult financial situation.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And when it can soon go bankrupt,

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
and then all the employees of this enterprise will be behind the gates.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
In this case, employees are often fired without a salary.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
At the same time, there are long-term delays in the salary.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Employees are very worried in these cases.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
It is very important for them to know how stable this enterprise is,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
whether it will survive, whether it will return.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
After all, they are patriots, they continue to work at their enterprise.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
They hope and believe in this enterprise.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
They really want to know that everything is fine in this enterprise.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
They are ready to ask every day, every week, if everything will be fine.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
So we saw who needs financial accountability at the enterprise.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Thus, financial accountability is not an empty sound, not bare numbers on paper.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
Financial accountability is a business and a life of a large number of people

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
that are connected by the business threads with this enterprise.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
That is why we need to know financial accountability,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
study it, understand it, read it, evaluate it and draw conclusions.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
This is what our lecture is dedicated to.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Now let's talk about financial accountability.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
What requirements are presented to it by all the above-mentioned people

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
who are interested in studying financial accountability?

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Let's list them and discuss the most important ones.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Let's open their contents.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Financial accountability must be objective.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It must be truthful.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
It should not contain lies, it should not contain embellishments.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Since everyone studies financial accountability and perceives it as a pure coin,

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
it should be absolutely truthful.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Unfortunately, it should be noted that business in our country

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
does not always provide objective financial accountability.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
It is the case that business in our country is embellished

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
with financial accountability, especially for tax services.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Moreover, you can find such attitude of the business leaders

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
that financial accountability is made for tax services

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
and the leader is not even interested in financial accountability.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It is so far from reality.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
This is a bad attitude to financial accountability.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
This is the situation that should be avoided.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Time will put everything in its place.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Taxation in our country will become more or less normal,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
civilized as in the rest of the world,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and our business will not run away from taxes,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
will not hide from taxes, but will honestly pay the small taxes

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
that should be paid in any civilized country.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Then financial accountability that we are talking about

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
will become absolutely objective.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It will not contain a single drop of what is not really there.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
The main requirement of financial accountability is its neutrality.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
It should be neutral, regardless of the interests of a particular business.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
It should be ready to accept any subjects

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
that are interested in financial accountability.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
It should reflect the interests of all these subjects.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Financial accountability should be independent.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
It should be as objective as possible,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
regardless of the people who prepare it.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Recently, there has been a trend in our country

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
when accounting is transferred to outsourcing.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
When there are specialized companies

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
that deal with accounting.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
It is worth noting that if an independent company

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
that does not serve its own business,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
does not serve its CEO,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
does not conduct an accounting,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
then this accounting is largely independent

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
of the will of the person to do so.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Therefore, it is more objective,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
more precise in reflecting information.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
The next requirement of accountability is its comparability.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The thing is that the accountability we are talking about

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
is not necessary on its own.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It is not necessary to put it on a shelf

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
and let it lie there and get dusty.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Accountability is necessary to conduct analysis

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
and compare various enterprises

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
or, within the framework of the same enterprise,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
various periods of its business.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
To compare various countries,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
to consider the development of our own country

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
in which we live from a business point of view.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But in order to do all this,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
all accountability must be similar, comparable.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
In this case, they can easily be comparable.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Financial accountability must be periodic.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It cannot be issued every day.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It is not necessary,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
because the preparation of this accountability

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
requires a lot of effort of the workers who prepare it.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
But it cannot be issued

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
in a very long period of time,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
let's say, every 10 years.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
It is pointless to make management decisions every 10 years.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
In 10 years, anything can happen to the enterprise.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It may not live to the next financial accountability.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
But it is an optimal regime

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
in which the financial accountability is prepared.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Financial accountability is made once a quarter,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
that is, four times a year.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
As a result of the year,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
annual financial accountability is made.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The next requirement is the full coverage.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Financial accountability must take into account

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
all the costs that the enterprise has incurred,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
all the costs that the enterprise has incurred,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and all the results that it has achieved.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It must cover everything, reflect everything,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
and show all the operations that took place at the enterprise.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It must not leave anything behind.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Financial accountability and shadow economy,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
as we see, are incompatible.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Because one assumes the absence of the other.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Financial accountability must be reliable.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
The information contained in it

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
must be true,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
must be understandable,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
it must cause trust.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Moreover, the information

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that is considered in financial accountability

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
should not be infinitely large.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It should be narrowed down to the level

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
that is needed to understand

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
the real financial state of the enterprise.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
This is what the next quality

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
that is presented in financial accountability is about.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It is its significance.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Only significant moments

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
should be in financial accountability.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What does annual financial accountability include?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Financial accountability prepares the accounting.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Annual financial accountability includes

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
the following.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Accounting balance, form 1.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Accounting of profits and losses, form 2.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Accounting of capital changes, form 3.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Accounting of money movements, form 4.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Accounting balance application, form 5.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
An explanatory note

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
that analyzes the factors

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
that led to certain results of the enterprise.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
This is the final part of the audit.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
In the cases when this audit

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
is necessary for the enterprise.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Now we will look at

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
the main document of financial accountability

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
in more detail.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It is the accounting balance.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Before studying the accounting balance,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I recommend you to hold it in your hands.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
One thing is to study it theoretically,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
but you should see it in front of you.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
On the slide that you see now

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
you see the general example

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
of the accounting balance.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It consists of two parts, the left and the right part.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
We will talk about it in detail now.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
But the most important thing is that

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
you should hold such an accounting balance in your hands.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Use your own enterprise.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It will be interesting for you to learn

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
how to use it.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
The accounting balance is an open document.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
No one hides it.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
This document is presented to those who ask for it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You can turn to your accounting office

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
and say that studying the course of financial management

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and being ready to become a high-class financier

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
or the head of the enterprise

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
who understands the activities of the enterprise

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and is going to manage it very high quality

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
requires studying the accounting balance.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
No one will refuse you.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You will get the accounting balance

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
and study it carefully, read it,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
you will understand and see a lot of useful information.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What does the accounting balance contain?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The left and the right part.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
The left column.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
The right column.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
The left column shows the assets of the enterprise.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
The assets of the enterprise are structured

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
according to the composition and direction of their use.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
The right column shows the same assets,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
but structured according to the sources of their financing.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
The left and the right part,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I want to draw your attention to,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
are the same assets of the enterprise.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
The only difference is the cut of these assets.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
One cut reflects the direction of use,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
and the other cut means

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
the sources of the resources.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Where did these resources come from

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and where were they directed?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
It's all simple in the accounting balance.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
There is nothing complicated.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
The accounting balance also meets the following requirements.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Since these are the same resources,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
the left and the right part,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
the balance amount of the left part

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
is equal to the balance amount of the right part.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The balance amount of the right part

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
is equal to the balance amount of the left part.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Therefore, we can safely say

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
that the balance amount of all assets

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
is equal to the balance amount of all balances.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
The balances of the enterprise

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
are the sources of the enterprise's financing.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
They consist of two blocks.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
The main source of the enterprise's capital

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
is the right balance amount of the left part.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Moreover, it consists of the private assets

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
as well as the obligations

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
that the enterprise has

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
in order to borrow some funds.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So, private assets and obligations

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
are equal to the assets.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Passives are equal to the assets,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and assets are equal to the amount

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
of private assets and obligations.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
These are the requirements

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
of each part of the accounting balance.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Let's focus on the assets,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
on the left part.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
We will study them carefully

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and see what they are.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I recommend you to take the balance

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and study it carefully,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
listen to the lecture and look at the balance.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It will be easier for you to master it,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
to understand what it consists of,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and to understand the meaning of the lines.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Why are they written in one way or another?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
There is nothing random or chaotic in the balance.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It contains the great logic

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
of the financiers

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
who prepared the balance.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
The assets of the enterprise

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
are grouped by their liquidity.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Liquidity means

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
that the balance is not fixed

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
and that it is possible

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
to turn the assets into money.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
The more liquidity the asset is,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
the easier and faster

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
it turns into money.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It is clear that the most liquidity asset

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
is the money assets.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
They are very easy to turn into money.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Everything else

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
requires a longer period

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
of time to turn

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
the assets into money.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
The lines of the asset

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
are written from top to bottom

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
according to the degree of liquidity.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
The top line

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
is the least liquidity asset,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
the bottom line

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
is the fastest liquidity asset.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
So, from top to bottom

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
the assets are divided

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
into two blocks.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
The first one is the long-term assets.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
They are located in the upper part of the balance.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
You can see them.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And the bottom one is the short-term assets.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
They live

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
less than the long-term assets.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
In the balance,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
they are called the non-return assets

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and the return assets.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
The long-term assets

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
are used for more than one reporting period.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
As you remember,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
the reporting period is one year.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And the assets used

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
for more than one year

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
are used in the production process

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and transfer their value

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
slowly, through amortization

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
and transfer their value

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
slowly, through amortization.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
The short-term assets

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
have less than one reporting period.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The passives

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
are grouped by the return period.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Again, the movement from top to bottom

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
is divided into

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the longer-term assets

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and the short-term assets.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and the longer-term assets.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
That's why the upper passives

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
are the assets,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
the capital of the enterprise.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It is supposed to be returned

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
at the very last moment.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And if the enterprise works for a long time,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
it will never be returned.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It will serve as long as the enterprise exists.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
If we look at the

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
assets,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
we will see

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
that the short-term assets,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
those that serve less than one reporting period,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
include the reserves,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
the debit debt,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
the short-term financial investments

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
and the money.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
We have already said that the money is not random,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
it is at the very bottom.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
The short-term assets are the assets

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
that you invested for a very short period.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Maybe you have a loan.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And they will soon be returned

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
in the form of money.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
That's why they are a little higher

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
than the money.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Next is the debit debt.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
These assets are the assets

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
that you invested

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and the money that you should

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
return, but you haven't yet.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
We will talk about the debit

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
and credit debt later.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
We will talk about it in more detail.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And now we will talk about the reserves.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
The reserves are the highest

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
line of the short-term assets.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
The reserves are what the enterprise needs

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
for normal functioning.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
If the enterprise has no reserves,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
it risks to disrupt

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
the rhythm of its work.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
The enterprise should work

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
like a clock,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
rhythmically, from minute to minute.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
A production cycle is built on this.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
But unfortunately,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
there is a reality,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
which is connected with the actions

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
of the enterprises.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
They buy raw materials,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
there is an electricity supply,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
which can be unstable,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
sometimes it can be disconnected.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
There are employees of the enterprise,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
who are also people,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
who sometimes go on vacation.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Therefore, they are not at work.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Sometimes they get sick,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
this is also a disruption of the production process,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
a disruption of rhythm.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But a disruption of rhythm

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
is a painful phenomenon for the enterprise.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The fact is that the enterprise

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
is not on its own,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
not on the Moon,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
not detached from the reality.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
This enterprise is connected

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
with a huge number of contracts

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
for the supply of the produced goods.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And the fact that the rhythm of the enterprise

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
is disrupted, and it cannot provide

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
the supply of this product in time,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
leads to the failure of other enterprises.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
But no one wants to deal

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
with an unrhythmic business,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
with an unpredictable business,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
which can break the contract.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
This is not comfortable for the business.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
If the business disrupts the rhythm of its work,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
this enterprise is not very profitable

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
as a partner.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Not everyone wants to deal with it.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Especially not everyone wants to trust

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
their finances or invest their finances

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
in this enterprise.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Therefore, the enterprise,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
unfortunately, has to have reserves.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
And with the help of reserves,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
certain additional expenses,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
you need to build warehouses.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You need to have accessories in these warehouses.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And only then, when there are warehouses

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
with accessories, will there be

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
normal rhythmic work.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But these are additional expenses.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
But, unfortunately, these additional expenses

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
must be paid by the enterprise.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Then they will provide the rhythm of work.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
And not only in our country.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
So far, we have not managed to achieve

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
such a degree of rhythm,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
so that you can do without reserves.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
So that you can carry out direct deliveries

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
of accessories for the enterprise,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and the enterprise would not need warehouses,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
would not need reserves.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The only country that has realized

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
this possibility is Japan.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
In Japan, the deliveries of accessories

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
are made directly from the wheels of the enterprise.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Where they are realized

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
in the production process.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
There is no need to have reserves and warehouses.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The peculiarity of Japan...

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Japan could not be repeated

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
by any other country.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Probably, this is related to the mentality

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
of Japanese business.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Japan is a very small country.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Very small.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Compare Russia and Japan.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Imagine on the map

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
a huge Russia and a small Japan.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
And now, for comparison,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
in these two countries

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
approximately the same population lives.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
A huge Russia and a small Japan.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
And this small size of the territory

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
has created a potential possibility

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
of fast delivery of accessories

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
from one enterprise to another.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Maybe, it is only necessary to move the road

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and the delivery is already carried out.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
This is one of the reasons

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
why in Japan it was possible

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
to implement the system

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
without warehouses on the enterprises.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Nevertheless, in our country

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
we have a lot of warehouses.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And often, without the need

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
of subjects,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
the reserves are vital.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
There are reserves, there is rhythm.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
There is a great work,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
there is a support of good relations

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
between enterprises.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
The next point we will talk about

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
is about the positions

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
that exist at the enterprises.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
There are two types of positions.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Debit and credit.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Debit positions are those

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
that are credited to the enterprise

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
but haven't been received yet.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Maybe, the enterprise

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
delivers goods

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and gets a so-called goods credit.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
This is especially common in trade.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The enterprise tries to get

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
goods without money,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
with a payment deadline,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
to return the money after the goods are delivered.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And the producers have more and more

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
debt.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
They need more and more money.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
But we have to understand

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that no enterprise can give

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
its goods without getting money.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
In any case, it will simply stop

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
functioning.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
So, everything is only to a certain extent.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
For this reason,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
every enterprise in the country,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
as well as in the whole world,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
strives to not allow

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
high debt.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Yes, all enterprises agree

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
to send goods to the credit

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
but only with a return of money.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
There is even a policy

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
to return the debt.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
There are employees

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
whose function is

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
to return the debt.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
They call in agents,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
they talk to them every day,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
they persuade them, beg them, ask them.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Then, in an orderly manner,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
they ask them to return the money.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And in the worst case,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
they call in the legal authorities.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
They call in arbitration,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
which can force the enterprise

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
to return the money,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
or it can make it bankrupt

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
if it cannot return the money.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Calling in the legal authorities

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
is the most reliable,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
although the last resort.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Besides the debenture debt,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
the enterprise has a credit debt.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It is a tricky debt.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It is what you owe,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
and you don't want to return it.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
The most common reason is

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
that there is nothing to return.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Yes, there is a debt,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
but there is nothing to return.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
You can always return the money,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
and you can pay it back,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
but you cannot return it yet.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Often, it is before the production is completed.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
When the production is completed,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
you will have the money to pay the debt.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But sometimes

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the enterprise misuses the credit debt,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
even when it has the money.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And when it develops very quickly,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
it tries not to return it.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
In this case, it works negatively.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
The thing is,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
the return of the credit debt

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
is like a credit card debt.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It is a matter of honor.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
If the enterprise returns it,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
it is trusted,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and it can continue to receive

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
the credit debt.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
But if the enterprise has a normal financial situation,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
that it has money,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
it buys products,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
but does not want to return the credit debt,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
the enterprise loses trust.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
It does not want to work with it,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
because it misuses

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
the trust of its partners.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Therefore, the credit debt

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
is a double-edged sword.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Almost all enterprises have a credit debt.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
But it cannot be misused.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And if you have the opportunity,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
when you have a financial improvement

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
of the enterprise's activities,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
the credit debt should be returned

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
at least partially,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
at least to your most important business partners.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Then the trust in you will be much higher.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Now we will talk about money.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
We said that the lowest line of the asset

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
is the money.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Why does an enterprise need money?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Where to go?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
First, you have to pay the salary.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Second, you have to buy the components,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
carry out the production process,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and sell the products.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You can never do without money.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
That's on the one hand.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But imagine that an enterprise

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
does not have money.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
It's a difficult case.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
An enterprise has nothing to pay

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
to its employees.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But in our country,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
the lion's share of the population

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
lives from salary to salary.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
As soon as the salary delay begins,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
it affects the workers' condition.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
The company starts looking for new jobs.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
It has an opportunity to lose

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
reliable, proven, necessary personnel.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Moreover, if a person does not receive

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
his salary for a long time,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
all his thoughts are not about work,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
but about how to survive in this situation.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Even in this case,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the enterprise starts losing its employees.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
If it does not have money,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
it will not be able to pay for its work.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Who will do the work for you

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
for the second time?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
We see that an enterprise needs money

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
to function normally.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
If an enterprise wants to develop,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
to produce more and more products,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
it needs money to hire new employees,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
to sign new contracts,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
to buy new products,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
to buy new equipment.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
All this is impossible without money.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Yes, it is clear.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You say that money is necessary.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Why then do many enterprises not have it?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Why does this debt appear

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
that makes enterprises

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
function for someone else's money?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
The fact is that there is

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
such a phenomenon as inflation.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Inflation devalues the money

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
that is in the enterprise's account.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Every day,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
inflation devalues a certain part

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
of the money.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And the higher the inflation level,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the more money is devalued.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
This year,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
according to the forecast,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
8% inflation is expected in the country.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
The company's money will disappear.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It will simply disappear

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
due to inflation.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But if the money is kept in another form,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
for example, in the form of stocks,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
then in a year,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
when inflation occurs,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
the prices of these stocks will rise.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And we will see

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
that instead of devaluing money,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
the prices of stocks

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
will not only decrease,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
but will remain.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Because we kept money

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
in the form of stocks.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And this inflation

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
pushes enterprises to get rid of money,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
to stop keeping it,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
to let it go as quickly as possible.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Today, we got money,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
but we can't get it back.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Let it be stocks,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
let it be components.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Yes, this is a struggle against inflation.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And those who use this money

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
save their money and don't lose it.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
But unfortunately,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
if there is no money in the company,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
then other problems arise.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And the whole work of the company

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
is to fix these two extremes.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
On the one hand,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
save money from inflation,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
and on the other hand,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
have the necessary money

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
to let the company work rhythmically,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
and pay the salary and develop.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
To find this line

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and the task of the financiers,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
including you, listeners,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and management,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
is to teach how to distribute

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
the company's finances

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
to provide the company with optimal work.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
If we look at the assets,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
we will see that in the upper part

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
there are non-return assets.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
If the non-return assets

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
participate once during the accounting period,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
then the non-return assets

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
will be returned to the company

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
during the accounting period,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
during the year.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Look at the slide,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
non-material assets,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
basic funds,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
unfinished construction,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
long-term financial investments,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
and other non-return assets.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
These are assets that serve the company

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
for many years.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
This is a workshop that will serve

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
this company for many years.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
This is equipment that will serve

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
for many years.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
These are non-material assets,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
that is, assets that can bring

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
income to the company.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
For example, licenses, patents,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
trademarks,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and other assets that the company

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
will build its business on.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Long-term financial investments

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
are investments in other companies

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
in the form of loans.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Sometimes the companies lend money to each other.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
When it is lent from banks,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
it is a loan.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
When it is lent from another company,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
it is a loan.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Sometimes loans are given for joint business.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
In any case, these are funds

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
invested to run a business.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Now let's look at the passive,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
the right part of the balance.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
The right part of the balance

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
is passive.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
These are the sources of the company's resources.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Passive is responsible for

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
the balance of the company's assets.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Now let's look at where the money came from.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Where did the company get these resources?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
How did it get them?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Looking at the right part of the balance,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
we see where the company got these resources.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
First of all, without counting the top,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
we see that there is its own capital.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
That is, what is the company's property.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
The top is the institutional capital

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
that the company has invested

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and could gradually increase

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
the institutional capital as it existed.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
The institutional capital is needed

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
for the company to start functioning.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Over time, the institutional capital increases.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And the greater the institutional capital,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
the more important this company is in the market.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
You probably know that the minimum

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
amount of institutional capital

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
in our country is 10,000 rubles.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Tell me, please,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
can at least one enterprise function normally

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
if it has only 10,000 rubles?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
No. You can only register the enterprise

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
with this money. That's all.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Moreover, all this amount

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
will be taken by banks

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
for opening accounts for you and working with you.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And by the time you start functioning

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
as an enterprise, you will have no money in your account.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The institutional capital is very, very little.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And when the enterprise says,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
what is the size of your institutional capital?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
10,000 rubles?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Well, then you are such a small, small enterprise.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
And the attitude to you is the same.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
And when they say that you have many, many millions,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
or even billions of institutional capital,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
you are very, very reliable.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
It is not by chance that the requirement

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
for 5 million euros is already a solid requirement.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Although it is minimal.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
But this already means that you can trust this bank.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And if there was only 10,000 rubles,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
then there would be no trust for such a bank.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
In addition to the capital itself,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
which we are talking about now,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
the enterprise's passive is a long-term

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
and short-term commitment.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
The enterprise functions

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
not only at the expense of its own funds,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
but often not only at the expense of its own funds,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
but also at the expense of the loans

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
that it receives on the market.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
What are the main forms of loans?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
First of all, it is a loan.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
An enterprise that can provide

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
a mortgage, which functions normally,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
which is financially stable,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
for such an enterprise is not a big loan.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It is very difficult to get a loan in a bank.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Today, the banking sector is quite developed,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and you can apply to a huge number of banks

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
for a loan.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
The main condition for obtaining a loan

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
is financial stability

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and the presence of a mortgage

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
at the enterprise itself.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Unfortunately, the enterprise is trying

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
to apply for a loan when they already have

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
a mortgage, but the conditions are not met.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
But even then, banks can't help.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
The business should treat loans like this.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
A loan is not a life-saving circle,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
but a way of business development.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
If you approach it like this,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
then a loan is needed for a successfully

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
developing enterprise

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
to develop even faster.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Banks are happy to go to all kinds of loans.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
They are happy to meet you.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
The enterprise itself easily processes

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
the loan, makes a profit,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and shares it with the banks

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that gave them the loan.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Besides loans, there are loans.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
As I told you today,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
loans are the same loan,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
but they are not obtained from a bank,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
but from another enterprise,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
and they are not in business partnership.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
It lends you money,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and you lend it to it.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
It's almost the same loan,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
but the difference is that

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
it doesn't require a mortgage.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
A loan is built between businesses

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
on trust.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
If we trust each other as business partners,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
we lend each other money

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
and we run a business together.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
This is the difference between loans and loans.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
This difference is also seen

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
in Muslim banks.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
It's not without interest for you to know

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
that Muslim banks are different from banks

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
that have developed in the Christian world.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Muslim banks are connected

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
by the fact that they should function

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
in a way that doesn't violate the conditions

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
of the Christian world.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
The Koran forbids taking interest

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
in the money provided.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The entire banking world is built

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
on the fact that a bank earns interest

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
on the loan it gives.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
This contradiction

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
didn't allow the Muslim banks

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
to appear for a long time.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Only the search of businessmen

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
to not violate the Koran

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
but to function as a bank

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
led to the fact that

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Muslim banks don't issue loans

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
but when they do,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
they join the company in business.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
They don't get a percentage,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
but the profit earned in the project.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
If the profit isn't earned,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
they don't get it back.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
If they lose, they lose together.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
The risk is doubled.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
This is the difference

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
between Muslim banks and the banks

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
we are used to dealing with in our country.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
In our country, there are no Muslim banks.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
But if you, as a financier,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
work in Muslim countries,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
like the UAE,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
remember that the banks there

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
are the ones who pay the interest.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Besides loans and loans,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
the companies attract money

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
by placing bonds and interest.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Sometimes you need to pay,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
but you don't have the money.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
We've already said that

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
the companies are fighting inflation,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
they tighten their belts,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
but you need to pay to keep working.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
What can you do?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
There's Vexel.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
You can pay with Vexel.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
It's a loan agreement

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
that the company writes out

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and gives its partner the right

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
to ask for the money

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
after a certain period.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Vexel can live its own life

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
and move from one company

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
to another.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
The trust in Vexel

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
is determined by the trust

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
in the person who gave it.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
If Vexel gave out a reliable company,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
it lives a full financial life.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Everyone trusts it

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and it's no different from money.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Vexel also brings interest.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
But if you've already borrowed

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
all the loans you could,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
all the banks have given you,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
but the bonds are over,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
no one will give you loans anymore.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
You've already borrowed everything you could.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
You've already given out all the loans

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
to anyone who agreed to take Vexel.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
You want to develop further.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You need money.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
That's when the company

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
applies for a bond.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
It's a valuable document

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
that the company

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
puts on the market.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Everyone who wants to buy

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
a bond pays a higher interest

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
than a company that puts

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
deposits in banks.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Banks are usually more reliable

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
than bonds.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
But here's an important point.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Whose bonds will you buy?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
If you buy bonds of a large,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
reliable company,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
be sure that the bonds

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
are 100% reliable.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
You'll get your interest

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
and it'll be more, better,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
than just keeping it

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
on an account

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
where inflation is working.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
All these instruments I've listed

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
are long-term bonds.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
They last for more than one year.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
But these instruments can be used

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
for less than one year.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
You can get a loan for less than one year.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
For example, overdraft.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
The point is

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
that every month

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
you have to report to the bank

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
that you can pay off the loan.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
You have to get the same amount

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
as the bank.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
If the capital turnover

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
is high,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
for example,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
overdraft is the best loan.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
This loan is suitable

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
for trading companies.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
It doesn't require a deposit.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
The most restricting factor

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
in getting a loan

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
is a deposit.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Especially in our Russian business

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
where our companies grow from scratch.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Overdraft doesn't require a deposit.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
For businesses

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
where the capital turnover

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
is less than one month,

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
overdraft is the best loan.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Think about it.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
If you have your own business,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
what is the capital turnover

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
for your business?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
If it's less than one month,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
go to the bank and say

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
that you have a loan

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
that you can pay off

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
for less than one year.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
In this case,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
all these sources

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
are short-term obligations.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
They are the source

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
of the business' functioning.
