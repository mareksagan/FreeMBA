00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What can we do for the same organizational behavior?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
How to improve it? How to optimize it?

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
How to achieve the desired results for us as business owners?

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Here you can identify several different approaches,

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
but we will focus on two main areas

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
that are used in business in the modern world.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
These are behavioral and cognitive approaches.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
As we have already said, these approaches emerged in the last century.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
The behavioral approach emerged at the beginning of the last century,

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
and the cognitive approach emerged somewhere in the 1960s.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
These approaches have already proven themselves as effective tools

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
that give us the operational opportunity to achieve the desired result.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
We can apply them in practice.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's see what these approaches are and how they can be useful to us.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our goal now is not to learn

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
how to use the relevant topics and methods.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Our goal is to get acquainted with these methods.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
As for the specific application and practice,

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
this is a separate conversation, and this conversation will be devoted to the further topics of our course.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Traditionally, the behavioral approach,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
which was introduced in 1911,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
is associated with the name of John Watson,

01:43.000 --> 01:54.000
and is associated with the problem of the development and formation of a person's certain skills and certain reactions.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
John Watson set the task of the behavioral approach.

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
He said that we can see a person's behavior,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
we can see what he does well, what he does badly,

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
what needs to be improved in order to achieve the best result,

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
how to influence a person so that there are no corresponding results.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
There is a system of encouraging positive behavior and punishing or sanctioning undesirable behavior.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
These are some incentives that are present in the environment.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We can influence a person.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
We can influence a person with these incentives.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
These can be painful sensations,

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
these can be some desired motivation incentives,

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
such as a raise in salary, career growth, participation in the company's activities, options, and so on.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
In order to get the desired reaction,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
loyalty of a person,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
in the application business, of course, we consider the loyalty of a person,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
his greater involvement in the activity,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
greater self-reliance,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
his interest in obtaining certain results.

03:24.000 --> 03:36.000
The main basic formula that is present in behaviorism and was formulated by Watson in 1911 is the stimulus-reaction formula.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
We can influence a person with external stimuli.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
The influence of these external stimuli leads to a certain reaction of a person to these stimuli.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
The reaction is that he starts doing something, he stops doing something, he increases something, accelerates something, prevents something.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
Therefore, if we select the appropriate stimuli, we will be able to get the desired reactions.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
John Watson said,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Give me a child and tell me who he should be.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And then I will make sure that you get the desired result.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
This idea turned out to be very useful, very interesting, and very demanding.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
Behaviorism started its victorious march, both in science and, accordingly,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
it found a variety of applications,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
applicable to people, to organizational behavior of people in organizations.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
We will not consider the whole history of behaviorism,

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
but will focus on the results of the classic of this approach by Boris Friedrich Skinner,

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
an outstanding American psychologist,

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
who had a decisive influence on the whole organizational behavior,

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
on the whole system of development of certain skills, certain reactions,

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
under the influence of external stimuli.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
Skinner is, in fact, a continuer and developer of Watson's ideas,

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
and the main difference is that Skinner divided the so-called respondent behavior and operant behavior.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
Respondent behavior is the reaction of the body to external stimuli.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
A classic example is Pavlov's experiment.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
We take a dog, show it food, and saliva starts to come out.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
This is respondent behavior, a reaction to some external stimulus that is presented.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
If saliva is presented, it comes out. If it is not presented, saliva is not produced.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
For a long time, respondent behavior was the main subject of study of psychology,

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
and, accordingly, when these results were applied to organizational behavior,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
this respondent scheme was also built there.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
You want to earn more, so you make more products.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Here is the stimulus of the reaction. The more products, the more you earn.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
There is a stimulus that leads to the desired reaction.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
And until the middle of the 20th century, respondent behavior was mainly studied.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Skinner also started with this.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
However, Skinner noticed that in fact, in addition to respondent behavior,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
when there is a pure reaction to external stimuli, there is another type of behavior.

06:49.000 --> 06:58.000
A person does something, and as a result of what he does, there are consequences of behavior.

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
If a person works successfully, then it is rewarded with bonuses, promotion to the service.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
A person may not think that he works to get a promotion to the service.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
However, his work was rewarded with some stimulus.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Here, the consequences of behavior are the main thing.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
And the behavior that is characterized by the results that it eventually gets,

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
Skinner called operant behavior, which is based on certain actions.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
An animal, a person, performs certain actions and gets the consequences of this action.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
After I got the consequences of the action, if I like these consequences,

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
I will repeat, improve, modify the behavior that caused these consequences.

08:00.000 --> 08:11.000
If I don't like the results I got, I won't repeat this behavior, and, accordingly, this behavior will disappear.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
If, for example, at every place of work I constantly begin to defend my rights,

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
require adequate assessment of me as a specialist,

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
then it will be very often due to the fact that I will look for new and new places of work.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
This is not a satisfactory result for me, and, accordingly, such a kind of behavior in a normal person

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
will lead to the fact that he will gradually modify his behavior and stop insisting on his rights.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Then he will get some satisfactory results and will consolidate them.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
This is a very simple idea that Skinner talked about, but this idea was really revolutionary.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
In this case, I will not constantly think about what stimuli to apply.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
I will think about the consequences of this or that behavior,

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
and cultivate, develop the behavior that leads to the consequences that suit and interest me.

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
Therefore, if we are talking about an organization, and the head of the organization sets certain goals for it,

09:28.000 --> 09:38.000
then it is necessary to calculate the consequences that will be associated with certain behavior,

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
and make an effort to form, accelerate, strengthen the desired behavior with the desired consequences,

09:47.000 --> 09:56.000
and at the same time avoid behavior that will go against the goals that are set.

09:57.000 --> 10:08.000
This idea turned out to be very fruitful, and for a long time the analysis of operant organizational behavior

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
played a significant role in the entire theory of organization.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
Scientific organization, labor, and theory of theory of organization are also largely based on these behavioral ideas.

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
As for Skinner, he is worthy of praise for this direction and this study.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
However, Skinner himself was also a great pragmatist.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
Having developed a new approach to training, different from the classic Pavlov's conditioning,

10:44.000 --> 10:56.000
Skinner began to develop training technology, because Skinner noted that in fact it is not enough to be able to set a goal,

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
it is not enough to be able to build an incentive to get the desired reaction.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
In order for us to get the desired results in business, education, and education,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
we need to create behavior technology.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
That is, the methods of training, the methods of education that will lead to the desired results.

11:22.000 --> 11:37.000
As for Boris Skinner, he was the developer and the founder of such a well-known training method as programmed training.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
He came to this training from his experience.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
Once he was invited to a math lesson that was conducted by his daughter.

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
In America, it was customary for parents to attend lessons to assess the behavior of children and their relationship with teachers.

11:58.000 --> 12:12.000
Skinner, sitting in this lesson, suddenly discovered that everything that the teacher did was in line with all the knowledge of behavior that was known.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
These were bifurcated knowledge.

12:14.000 --> 12:24.000
Accordingly, the teacher did not do anything to reinforce the desired reactions, did not deal with the problem of avoiding undesirable reactions.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
The teacher was on his own, the children were on their own.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
This is a very common situation that we can encounter now, not only in school, but also in universities.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Skinner thought, well, before that, all Skinner's experiments were carried out on animals.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
He loved pigeons very much, and all experiments on the development of operant behavior were carried out on pigeons.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
Skinner thought, we can do telegraphic actions on animals, but can't we apply these actions to humans?

12:57.000 --> 13:10.000
Here is a very important bifurcated idea that there is no fundamental difference between animals and humans in terms of the development of desirable behavior.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Therefore, Skinner thought about how to apply all this data to learning.

13:15.000 --> 13:23.000
He did not have to invent anything new, because, in fact, the idea of ​​programmed learning had already been formed in him.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Programmed learning is a modification of operant behavior.

13:27.000 --> 13:36.000
Very often, bifurcation accuses that all methods of animal training are transferred to people.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You can treat this accusation in different ways.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
But on the other hand, what does any leader want?

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
Any leader wants employees to quickly get to work and do exactly what is required of them.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
In fact, this is the situation in the development of the attachment of desired skills.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It was obvious to Skinner.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
In this regard, he simply transferred the idea of ​​operant behavior to programmed learning.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
As for programmed learning, Skinner developed it in two aspects.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
The first aspect is, of course, the training of children.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
But the second aspect was the training of professional skills.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
Because Skinner's work was in the middle of the last century.

14:31.000 --> 14:41.000
The middle of the last century was characterized by the fact that a large number of people, after the Great Patriotic War, returned to peaceful labor.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
And they had to learn a new skill, which, of course, they did not have.

14:46.000 --> 14:58.000
Learning this skill had to be fast, so that the organization of the company quickly received profit, invested funds and quickly received results from this investment.

14:59.000 --> 15:16.000
In this regard, Skinner formulated four programming skills that he transferred from his own research into the conditioning of operant behavior.

15:17.000 --> 15:33.000
The first requirement was that there should be a constant exchange between the learner and his teacher.

15:33.000 --> 15:42.000
It should not be the case that the teacher tells something about himself, and the student does something about himself.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Both are satisfied. They do not interfere with each other, everyone does his own thing.

15:45.000 --> 15:59.000
If I want a person to learn what I teach him as quickly as possible, to get the necessary skills, when we talk about learning from the point of view of behaviorism, we are talking about developing skills.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Skinner was not fundamentally engaged in mental processes.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
We'll talk about this a little later, when we move on to cognitive behavior theory.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Skinner was interested in behavioral skills.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
A person learns to do something with his hands, legs.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
These are behavioral skills.

16:19.000 --> 16:28.000
If I want to get the desired result from a person quickly, I need to ensure a feedback between the learner and the teacher.

16:29.000 --> 16:38.000
The teacher should see how correctly the skill is formed and correct the formation of this skill.

16:38.000 --> 16:50.000
The learner should understand what he is getting, where he has questions, what needs to be clarified from the bearer of this skill, the teacher who teaches him.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
It seems to be a simple idea, but it turned out to be very fruitful.

16:56.000 --> 17:04.000
On the other hand, it may have been strange for teachers in the mid-50s of the last century.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
For behavioral psychologists, it was a natural idea.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
It was an idea of reinforcement and punishment, which constantly functioned from the point of view of animal work.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
The next element of programmable learning was developed by Skinner.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
These were not some kind of interrelated skills.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
It was an operational description of how to build effective learning.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
Operational, as you remember, is a list of procedures for obtaining the desired skills.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
As for the second element, Skinner stated the following.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
We must break the complex skill into elementary components.

17:53.000 --> 18:02.000
And having broken them into elementary components, we must work out each of these components to the full automation.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
A person must learn to make micro-movements, micro-skills.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
And then, having made these micro-movements, he will get the final result.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
As for the research of Skinner, he mainly worked with operators, dispatchers.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
And here the task of automatic response to the symbols they receive was very important.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
To the data that the radar gives, to the data that is obtained as a result.

18:31.000 --> 18:42.000
But, of course, the same results of breaking the complex skill into component parts and processing elementary components into a whole skill

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
can be transferred to all other factors of learning.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Starting with school and ending with the skill of training professional behavior.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
The skill of developing professional competences.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
And Skinner here again drew attention to the fact that in no case should you make jumps.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Everything that suffers in the modern education system.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
Until a person has mastered the previous micro-skill, it is not worth moving on to the next one.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Everything must be done consistently.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
This will be due to the fact that we will strengthen the skills that we develop and what we receive.

19:19.000 --> 19:28.000
The next element of programmed learning that Skinner considered is that

19:28.000 --> 19:40.000
each student should be able to reproduce the skill that we teach him.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Again, a very simple situation.

19:44.000 --> 19:53.000
If a child who learns to write is not able to control his subtle motor skills with his fingers,

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
then no matter how much we demand, he will not learn to write calligraphy handwriting.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
Just because he does not have a subtle motor skill yet.

20:04.000 --> 20:13.000
And in order for this motor skill to develop, we need to do certain exercises to develop these muscles.

20:13.000 --> 20:25.000
Thus, any person can be taught only by those actions, only by the skill to which he is ready, which he is able to perform.

20:25.000 --> 20:35.000
You can't get what he hasn't formed and agreed on yet.

20:36.000 --> 20:45.000
The last element of programmed learning that Skinner introduces is the role of a mentor.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
Skinner talked about teachers, of course, but today we can talk about mentors, about coaches.

20:53.000 --> 21:09.000
The role of a mentor is to consistently bring the teacher to the correct answer by prompting, reminding, hinting, choosing an answer.

21:09.000 --> 21:18.000
We all have encountered programmed learning, it usually happens in the test results that we pass, the test with the choice of an answer.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
This is what programmed learning is.

21:20.000 --> 21:29.000
We choose the correct answer, and depending on what we have chosen, we get knowledge about whether we have mastered the material correctly or not.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
If we have mastered it correctly, we switch to a different level of learning.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
If we have mastered it incorrectly, we repeat the material until we get the right answer.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.000
What are all these credit events that take place during the MBA course?

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
We take part in a certain course, a certain component.

21:53.000 --> 22:06.000
It is pointless to study strategic planning if we have not studied the basic methodological approaches to its formation.

22:06.000 --> 22:17.000
Therefore, in order to get a stable skill, we need to have a strategy of behavior set up step by step.

22:17.000 --> 22:26.000
The role of a mentor is to control the level of learning we are at, whether we are ready to move on to the next step,

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
or we need to stop and refine, refine the material that we have now.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
This is the idea of programmed learning.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
It was formed by Skinner in the middle of the last century.

22:40.000 --> 22:50.000
Moreover, since then, almost without any changes, the idea of programmed learning has firmly entered the educational technology.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
Then it began to enter the technology of professional skills, professional competencies.

22:57.000 --> 23:07.000
A huge number of trainings that exist, which many of us have taken part in, are behavioral training.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
We develop the necessary skills.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
There are, of course, some disadvantages, which we will talk about a little later when we talk about cognitive learning.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
Because here our attitude to what we study is not taken into account, not our desire.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
We go through training and we get a skill.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Did we understand anything?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
It doesn't matter anymore.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
The main thing is that we have developed a skill.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
It is not always useful, but from the point of view of pragmatics, it works quickly.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
What interests the leader?

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
The leader is interested in making the employee quickly learn to perform the required actions.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
Come to work on time, submit a report on time, do certain actions on time.

23:51.000 --> 23:59.000
What is included in the competencies of time managing, which will also be considered in our course a little later.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
So, this is the idea of ​​programmed learning, which was proposed and implemented by Skinner.

24:05.000 --> 24:16.000
It was implemented because when we talk about Skinner, we are talking about a person who did not just give some ideas for other people to do their applications.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Skinner worked on each of his ideas in practice.

24:19.000 --> 24:30.000
That is why, despite the fact that bichlorism dates back to the beginning of the last century, despite the fact that Skinner himself died in 1990,

24:30.000 --> 24:39.000
his ideas, his concepts, his approaches live, develop and are very popular.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
Of course, not all skills can be developed this way.

24:44.000 --> 24:54.000
But if we talk about simple skills, bichloral approaches have no substitutes in terms of efficiency and speed.

24:54.000 --> 25:07.000
Again, as for Skinner, it should be noted that Skinner was practically the first person, the first researcher, the first scientist,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
who asked questions about behavior technologies.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
It's not a question of what behavior is, how it is implemented, but precisely about the technology.

25:16.000 --> 25:31.000
What paths, what steps, what stages, what steps are necessary to implement, through which steps a person must be conducted in order to develop the desired, required skill.

25:32.000 --> 25:46.000
And this idea of Skinner was widely recognized and then found a huge number of implementations in various of his manifestations.

25:46.000 --> 25:55.000
Naturally, these ideas did not stop there and got their further development.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
And as for this development, I think we should now talk about the approach of Edward Tolman.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
Again, we will consider, as agreed, those approaches that are applicable in our business practice,

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
which are not a scientific interest, but what has a pragmatic outcome,

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
that is, what is an investment that justifies itself.

26:25.000 --> 26:41.000
Very often, all behaviorists, and Skinner above all, were accused of not paying attention to the difference between a human and an animal.

26:41.000 --> 26:53.000
And what a person is proud of, his intellect, thinking, fall out of all these approaches, including the very same programming education.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
What do we use? We use memory and we use skill development.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, the worm can be taught this, and these experiments were made back in the 19th century, when the worms were taught to find the right way out.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
Still, if we are talking about a human, then we should not forget that a human is a homo sapiens sapiens, a reasonable person.

27:15.000 --> 27:25.000
And, accordingly, it is possible, of course, and this is undisputed, and behaviorists have clearly proven this, based on the method of stimulus,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
the reaction to achieve the desired result from a human.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
But can this process be accelerated?

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I am again drawing your attention to the process, I am talking about acceleration.

27:34.000 --> 27:44.000
You can get the necessary knowledge and education, as we received, after spending 5-6 years in one university, someone received a second higher education.

27:44.000 --> 27:57.000
And then, as the studies show, the same statistics, that of all the information that we receive in the university, in our life, in professional activity, we use no more than 10-15%.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
So why should we spend 5 years learning information, from which we will use only the 7th part?

28:04.000 --> 28:14.000
Behaviorists solved this problem by working out the skill, which they were accused of using in training.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Tolman was also a behaviorist, and also a supporter of the behavioral approach.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
However, Tolman thought about other issues.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Indeed, there is a stimulus, there is a reaction, there are undisputed results, and there is a quick achievement of this result.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Can this process be accelerated?

28:31.000 --> 28:42.000
Tolman moved away from the tradition of behaviorism and drew attention to the following circumstances.

28:42.000 --> 28:50.000
Indeed, both stimulus and reaction are measurable, verifiable, and fast-proceduring.

28:51.000 --> 29:05.000
Nevertheless, there is another series of variables that can accelerate the process of transition from stimulus to desired reaction.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
Tolman, as a behaviorist, conducted his experiments on rats.

29:11.000 --> 29:19.000
And Tolman came to the conclusion that there are also intermediate variables.

29:20.000 --> 29:35.000
There is another variable between stimulus and reaction, the so-called intermediate variables, which are our cognitive and cognitive processes.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
The stimulus that affects us does not directly lead to a certain behavior.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
This is not a situation when we are pricked with a needle and we make some kind of involuntary movement.

29:46.000 --> 29:55.000
We heard something, we thought about something, we have a plan in our head, and only after that we give out a certain behavior.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Again, we were taught to draw everyone.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
But Picasso, Robins, are not all, it turns out a few.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
Anyone can learn to draw, but not everyone will get the desired result.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
What is this related to?

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
From Tolman's point of view, it is related to the presence of intermediate variables that exist.

30:16.000 --> 30:27.000
A person really has thinking, a person really has cognitive processes that are characterized by a lot of characteristics.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
Being a behaviorist, Tolman came from the fact that we will not get into this psyche.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
We will just take into account the presence of these variables.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
And he called these intermediate variables cognitive maps.

30:44.000 --> 30:55.000
At the same time, Tolman meant the cognitive maps that are very similar to those maps that we can navigate in space.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
If an animal is launched into a labyrinth, as Tolman did,

31:01.000 --> 31:10.000
then the animal, passing through this labyrinth, will remember where to turn and where to go.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
And when we launch this animal into the same labyrinth the next time, it will no longer wander aimlessly through the labyrinth.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
It will already follow some scheme, some map.

31:22.000 --> 31:30.000
Everything here is very similar to our human orientation on the map and the compass in the forest or in the field.

31:30.000 --> 31:40.000
Tolman talks about cognitive maps as a certain conscious image that arises in the head of an animal person

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
and which we associate with the environment in which we are.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
And then, thanks to this map, we can already navigate in this environment.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
The intermediate variables have a principled impact on the behavior of the orc from the point of view of the applicability of the results.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
What did the behaviorists do before Tolman?

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
They were, in fact, studying methods of trial and error.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
I try certain forms of behavior and look at the results that I get.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Operational conditioning.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
If the results suit me, I fix the behavior.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
If the results do not suit me, it's a mistake.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't implement this behavior.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
But these were real trials and errors.

32:24.000 --> 32:34.000
By introducing intermediate variables and a cognitive map, Tolman made it possible to talk about latent learning or hidden learning.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
And this is exactly the kind of learning that manifests itself both in humans and in higher animals.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Indeed, you can, with the help of behaviorism,

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
all behaviorism is directed to a specific real learning.

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
I form certain stimuli so that you get a new desired reaction.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
That is, it all happens in real situations.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
As for latent learning, the situation is different here.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
At the beginning, we talked about a variety of variables that exist.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Dependent, independent, random, distorted.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
All these variables still act.

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
Again, we emphasized that the fact of human behavior is associated with a huge number of circumstances that exist here.

33:26.000 --> 33:35.000
These variables are still remembered by a person, still leave their mark on his behavior.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
But they may not appear in action as a result of behavior now, they will appear later.

33:41.000 --> 33:55.000
Any of us can remember a large number of our teachers who did not seem to give us useful knowledge from our point of view.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
However, after a while, when we found ourselves in new circumstances,

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
when we found ourselves in new conditions, it suddenly turns out that what we were taught by one or another teacher,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
who we did not go to lectures with at all, and who we did not want to see,

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
suddenly what he taught us and what we thought we did not know and forgot, turns out to be useful.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
This is latent learning.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
A person is arranged in such a way that he remembers a large amount of information.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.000
And not all this information is immediately applicable in the activity.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
The circumstances of life change, the circumstances of professional activity change,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
the competencies that are required of us change.

34:33.000 --> 34:44.000
And here, quite unexpectedly, suddenly, any skills, any schemes, any knowledge that we have,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
but which we usually do not use, suddenly appear.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
We use them as necessary.

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
This is what is called conscious and unconscious competence.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Tolmav, in particular, when talking about the cognitive map and latent learning,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
talked about virtual trials and errors.

35:05.000 --> 35:14.000
In order for us to develop the desired behavior, we do not necessarily need to make real trials and errors.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
We can make them in our mind.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But again, an old example.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
In order to understand that we do not need to stick our fingers into the outlet,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
we do not need to put them in to get the electric current,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
we can see how someone was hit, we can see the consequences.

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
And this is no longer our experience, this is the experience that we saw, this is a virtual experience.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
But we took it into account and we are already in a normal state, in a normal state,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
we will not stick two fingers into the outlet.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
No matter how funny it is.

35:43.000 --> 35:55.000
After Tolman, these methods of learning gained their independence and they began to pay great attention.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
When it comes to organizational behavior,

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
then again, now, with many trainings, the same forms of training are used.

36:02.000 --> 36:10.000
During the training, we get a lot of information that, from our point of view, may not be useful to us later.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
However, by joining our everyday activities,

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
they provide the necessary help to us in terms of achieving this or that success.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
This was the transition that behaviorist Tolman made from the point of view of behaviorism

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
to the camp of supporters of the cognitive approach.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
And although Tolman himself remained in the behaviorist position until the end of his life,

36:38.000 --> 36:47.000
and believed that interpersonal changes were no more than a way to facilitate the account of a large number of external factors,

36:47.000 --> 36:56.000
his idea of cognitive maps, latent learning, virtual trials and errors was picked up and received further development.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
Moreover, it received further development, again, far from the immediate cognitive approach.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
It received further development in the same behavioral approach.

37:07.000 --> 37:16.000
And in this case, we are approaching such a significant figure of the behavioral approach as Albert Bandura.

37:16.000 --> 37:27.000
As for Albert Bandura, he was already engaged in non-animals.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Bandura considered the teaching of man.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
He was interested in the fact of teaching man, although he considered it from a behavioral position.

37:37.000 --> 37:48.000
And Bandura analyzed what these interpersonal changes that man has.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
Moreover, Bandura noticed that, yes, indeed, if we take a person,

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
then operant conditioning is significantly manifested in him.

37:59.000 --> 38:09.000
But where does a person get information about what consequences can be brought by one or another behavior?

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
Where does a person learn positive behavior, desirable, approved?

38:14.000 --> 38:22.000
Where does a person learn what behavior is undesirable, undesirable, which should be avoided?

38:22.000 --> 38:35.000
Where does this line between demonstrable, socially acceptable behavior and behavior that is undesirable, cross?

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
Bandura conducted research on children, on people, on adults.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Bandura conducted the study, unlike other bioherorists of the same topic, on people.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
And the main idea of Bandura is that every person is unique.

38:53.000 --> 39:00.000
For bioherorists, this is a very, well, let's say, very extraordinary idea.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
Because bioherorists come from the fact that no matter what qualities people have,

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
I will build my stimuli in such a way that any person will behave in a desirable way.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And Bandura comes from another.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
All people are individual.

39:16.000 --> 39:26.000
And therefore, all people with different speeds, with different degrees of success, with different degrees of applicability,

39:26.000 --> 39:36.000
master certain or other behavioral skills, and they develop behavior schemes in different ways.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
How are they developed?

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
And Bandura draws attention to the fact that a person is a social being.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
All human activity occurs in his interaction with other people.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
These people do something.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I want to be equal to some people.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I want to be similar to some people.

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't want to be similar to anyone and I will never imitate anyone.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
And here Bandura introduces the basic principle of learning through observation.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
No matter what kind of person we take, no matter what actions he is involved in,

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
a person always sees how other people behave.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
A person pays attention to the fact that someone is more successful in terms of promotion in service,

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
in terms of obtaining the desired results, in terms of promotion.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
Someone is less successful, although he may have a lot of different necessary knowledge,

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
he may have a lot of desired professional competencies, but he does not achieve the desired result.

40:42.000 --> 40:49.000
And a person with less professional competence achieves a higher material level of payment,

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
a higher social status and is more appreciated.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
And a person observes the behavior of other people.

40:59.000 --> 41:06.000
At the same time, he observes the behavior of those people who, for example,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
take the place that you want to take,

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
who, for example, came to work with you in the company at the same time,

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
only you, as a sales manager, you are still a sales manager.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
And the one you came with is already the deputy director of the sales department.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
What's the difference?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
They studied in the same university, received the same diploma.

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
Moreover, you can consider that you know the subject no worse than he does.

41:34.000 --> 41:43.000
And you begin to observe what behavior another person demonstrates

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
and what is the success of his behavior.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Again, the same operational conditioning.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
You observe the behavior of another person,

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
the consequences of which allow him to achieve the desired result.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
Therefore, if you strive to behave in a similar way,

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
we will leave the question of ethics aside now.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
If you behave in a similar way,

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
then you also have a similar chance of achieving the desired result.

42:16.000 --> 42:24.000
Bandura, of course, did not say anything new.

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
But the task is that in science, if you highlight a problem

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
and pay close attention to it,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
new studies begin.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
And Bandura did not conduct these studies.

42:40.000 --> 42:49.000
Bandura simply showed in practice how these systems of learning through observation work.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
And he showed it in socially significant situations.

42:53.000 --> 43:01.000
For example, Bandura's experiments on training children to certain behavioral skills,

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
such as aggressiveness, were very well-known.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
These experiments were very simple.

43:05.000 --> 43:14.000
And Bandura put these experiments to show that the media that surround us every day

43:14.000 --> 43:23.000
play a fundamental role in the development of any socially desirable, socially acceptable ways of human behavior.

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
There were three groups of children who watched a story

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
in which a certain behavior of a doll was demonstrated.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
There was a big inflatable doll.

43:35.000 --> 43:42.000
And in one story, the same child, the same age as the children,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
beat this doll with a stick.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
In all the stories, there was the same situation.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
There was a big inflatable doll.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
There was a child, the same age as the children, who beat this doll.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
However, there were different results.

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
In one story, after the child beat this doll, he was punished.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
And, accordingly, he was told that he was not behaving well.

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
In another story, after the child beat this doll, he was encouraged and told that he was doing the right thing.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And in the third story, there was no reaction.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
The child simply beat this doll.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
And then all the conclusions remained to be made by the children.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
This experience was at first banal.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
After that, it was repeatedly repeated.

44:34.000 --> 44:41.000
And the results showed that those groups of children who saw the encouragement of aggression,

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
the encouragement of the child who beat the inflatable doll,

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
those groups of children began to demonstrate more aggression.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
And this aggressive behavior began to appear more often in them.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
In those groups that saw that these aggressive actions were punishable,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
the children became less aggressive.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
And in those groups where, accordingly, there was a neutral reaction,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
the result was 50 to 50.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
Some of the children began to repeat this behavior, some did not.

45:19.000 --> 45:26.000
This experiment of Bandura was then repeated with children, adults, with different circumstances.

45:26.000 --> 45:36.000
And it showed very well that the media have a significant influence on the formation of our behavior.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
Again, these media can be used to develop socially acceptable forms of behavior,

45:43.000 --> 45:50.000
cooperation, support, as well as to develop socially unacceptable forms of behavior,

45:50.000 --> 45:58.000
competition, aggression, obstruction of someone's achievement of certain goals.

45:58.000 --> 46:11.000
As for Bandura, he later developed his idea,

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
which is applicable to fears, to how certain TV programs affect human behavior.

46:17.000 --> 46:30.000
But we are interested in the possibility of applying this method of Bandura to teach a person to require professional skills,

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
to what is called corporate ethics, corporate norms of behavior.

46:37.000 --> 46:48.000
Based on his observations, Bandura came to the conclusion that if the organization

46:48.000 --> 46:59.000
in one way or another demonstrates a desirable approach to work, behavior,

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
a desirable structure of relations, then a loyal relationship of the employee with the company will be formed,

47:05.000 --> 47:13.000
the required behavior skills will be formed, a certain corporate culture will be formed,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
this corporate culture will be broadcast to other people.

47:17.000 --> 47:27.000
And accordingly, when a new person comes to the company, who sees in a certain way the promoted forms of behavior,

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
he will adapt faster to this company and become a member of the team faster.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
Today we can say that these concepts of Bandura, which were considered,

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
found a wide application and a wide approach to modern organizational behavior.

47:43.000 --> 47:52.000
Now, when a new employee is included in a team in large companies,

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
he gets acquainted with the history of the company, with its founders,

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
he gets acquainted with various documents of the company.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
This is the formation of a person's required, desirable, approved corporate behavior,

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
his immersion in corporate culture and the development of corporate ethics.

48:13.000 --> 48:22.000
As for the study of the means of observation, Bandura created a social cognitive theory.

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
Again, note that Bandura remains a behaviorist, and it comes from the fact that the main thing for us is the behavior of a person.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
This behavior can be accelerated and made more productive, more effective,

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
if we, in addition to external stimulation, material competition, non-material stimulation,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
training of employees, evaluation of employees.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
If, in addition to this, we will also use some cognitive maps,

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
some cognitive processes that will show what is welcomed in a particular company.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
So Bandura was the creator of a social cognitive theory.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
The social one reflects the fact that a person lives among other people,

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
and a person's behavior is formed from the point of view of observing the behavior of others,

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
successful behavior of others, unsuccessful behavior of others,

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
and depending on what you want to achieve, how quickly you want to achieve it,

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
you will implement certain actions, certain methods, certain approaches,

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
which are implemented by a successful member of your team.

49:28.000 --> 49:35.000
You should know who to rely on, and you should know what results to get and when.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
This is a social component.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
Cognitive component means that in order to achieve the desired reaction,

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
you achieve it with the help of your cognitive components,

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
with the help of your thinking, with the help of your observability,

49:52.000 --> 49:58.000
with the help of those processes that you use to perform knowledge.

49:58.000 --> 50:06.000
In this sense, Bandura highlights four variables that affect the learning through observation

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
and make this observation more successful.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
The first variable is, of course, attention.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
It all depends on whether you are really attentive and can identify

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
those or other components of the behavior of another component of the behavior of the model

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
in order to adopt them.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.000
You can go to a certain suit, as the person who achieved success wears.

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
You can smoke the same cigars, you can wear the same rings,

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
you can use the same laptop or something else, but these are not determining factors.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Therefore, you should pay attention to some other characteristics

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
that make a person successful.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
Responsibility, accuracy, pedanticism, scrupulousness.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
Yes, of course, the suit is very important, but at the same time it is important what this suit is worn for.

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
The ability to identify those variables that need to be paid attention to,

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
those independent leading variables that you should practice,

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
this is a very important aspect of learning through observation.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
The next variable that Bandura highlights is memory.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Or our mnemonic processes.

51:30.000 --> 51:39.000
We must consciously remember the behavior that was successful

51:39.000 --> 51:50.000
and we must remember those actions, gestures, facial expressions, looks that were successful,

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
that helped you to realize the desired form of behavior.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
Finally, pay attention to who you need to spend more time with,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
who you need to consult more often, who to cross, who not to cross,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
who to defend your point of view from, who not to defend.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
These are also factors of success, you all know this from your own experience.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
So, the processes of behavior formation.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
In this case, Bandura means what we have already discussed,

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
the technology of this behavior.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
What Skinner also noticed.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
Behavior is not formed just like that.

52:30.000 --> 52:38.000
Behavior is realized through certain stages, through certain stages.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
You don't need to strive to do everything at once, you need to do everything gradually and consistently.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Bandura points out this separately.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
It constantly emphasizes the fact that if we talk about the process of behavior formation,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
then it must be done in stages.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
You don't need to strive to learn everything at once, it won't work.

52:59.000 --> 53:06.000
And finally, the last important variable in terms of Bandura is the motivational processes.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
This is a very interesting variable for behaviorism.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
After all, if we return to Skinner, and especially to Watson,

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
then in this case we are talking about stimulus reactions.

53:17.000 --> 53:25.000
At first, Tolma introduced intermediate variables, and thus introduced our thinking ability into behaviorism.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Bandura continues the same direction and introduces motivational processes.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
Motivation is why a person does something.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
What am I interested in getting any result?

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Why do I want to achieve any success?

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
What does it lead to? What do we get in the end?

53:45.000 --> 53:52.000
And by influencing this motivation, we are able to speed up the process,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
get an effective result.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
By getting this result, we achieve the goals that are set for us.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
You can increase your salary.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
But if the motivation of the employee does not change,

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
then no matter what salary you give him, he will not get more and better results.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
His motivation remains the same.

54:16.000 --> 54:24.000
If we start to overpay him for the successful work of the employee,

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
thereby we have a demotivating effect.

54:27.000 --> 54:36.000
And, of course, observing that my colleagues are sitting at the same tables,

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
spend the same working hours, but for 8 hours they write letters to someone,

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
play games, do personal affairs.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Why would I try?

54:49.000 --> 54:56.000
If they get the same money as I do, then the motive changes.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
Bandura drew attention to this aspect from the point of view of organizational behavior,

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
from the point of view of pragmatics of using these approaches.

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
And after Bandura, a large number of trainings, behavioral trainings,

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
began to be built from the point of view of analysis of motives,

55:14.000 --> 55:19.000
analysis of motivation schemes, material stimulation, non-material stimulation.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
After all, as we noticed, Bandura very often spoke about non-material stimulation.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
The same is true for the demonstration of successful activity.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
It is not always material stimulation.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
You never know what result it will lead to.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
These are the variables that Bandura highlighted.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
And, accordingly, these variables turned out to be operational

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
and a large number of trainings that are now being held in organizations

55:45.000 --> 55:50.000
in order to develop good sales skills, presentation skills,

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
skills of working with objections, skills of working with a difficult client,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
skills of working in a stressful state.

55:58.000 --> 56:05.000
And the whole other set of training lists that are now presented on the training market,

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
they are just significantly built on these variables,

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
where it is highlighted what to focus on, what to remember,

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
how to form behavior in stages, and a very important aspect of motivation.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
How do I build my motivation, the processes that are obtained,

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
in order to achieve the result that is before me faster.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
All these aspects, in fact, represent the social cognitive theory

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
that Bandura formulated and which differs from other existing theories.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Bandura's theory is pragmatic.

56:41.000 --> 56:48.000
If we take a scientific concept, there is a lot of theory, a lot of cognitive approaches.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
But this is a scientific theory, yes, they are, of course, correct, yes, they are interesting.

56:54.000 --> 57:02.000
But Bandura not only created a theory, he created a practically applicable, practically proven,

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
practically applicable theory that gives results.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
In this case, the results that were in demand in business,

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
and the results on which modern training is built,

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
for which we, as the leaders of companies, pay, respectively,

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
those or other funds, and we spend them from the point of view of investment.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
We invest funds in these trainings,

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
because then they will be called back to us by increasing our business performance.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
So, what we have just considered is a behavioral concept.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Starting with Bandura, starting with Skinner,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
a concept that is called radical behaviorism,

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
radical in the sense that it principally comes from the stimulus of reactions,

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
completely abandoning our psychological and cognitive abilities.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
Then, with the efforts of the behaviorist Tolman,

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
the behaviorist Bandura, intermediate variables are introduced,

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
cognitive maps are introduced, our mental processes are introduced,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
motivational processes are introduced,

58:05.000 --> 58:11.000
and gradually, the transition from behavioral theories to cognitive,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
to our own cognitive theories,

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
the essence and the task of which is to analyze the thinking abilities of a person.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
When we talk about cognitive theories as such,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
that is, our own cognitive theories,

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
then, of course, we must mention George Alexander Kelley,

58:34.000 --> 58:42.000
who was the creator, and he created his concept in the 1950s,

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
and then he remained largely incomprehensible,

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
because the middle of the last century is the dawn of behaviorism.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
Skinner, Tolman, Bandura are still the second half of the 20th century.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
So, when Kelley, in the mid-1950s,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
created his own cognitive theory,

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
which was called the cognitive theory of organizational behavior,

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
we will again consider it exclusively in our organizational context,

59:10.000 --> 59:16.000
we will not consider it from the point of view of scientific concepts,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
its pros and cons.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
So, as for Kelley's theory,

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
Kelley acted as an opponent of behaviorism.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
He supported all the arguments that were put forward against behaviorism.

59:32.000 --> 59:39.000
And the main argument was that a person is fundamentally different from an animal.

59:39.000 --> 59:46.000
Yes, of course, everything that we use to train rats, monkeys, pigeons,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
can be applied to a person.

59:48.000 --> 59:53.000
But a person is fundamentally different from all other animals.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Our mind, our mental abilities, our cognitive mechanisms.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And if we use only these cognitive mechanisms,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000
it will be more than enough not just for the formation of the necessary organizational behavior,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
but for the change of this behavior,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
for the radical change of this behavior and for the achievement of completely different results.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:29.000
As I said, Kelley was a main figure in the middle of the last century.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And only by the end of the 20th century,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
when the cognitive theory began to develop,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
the cognitive approaches began to develop,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
largely thanks to Bichiarist Tolman, Bichiarist Banduri,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Rotor, which also worked in the Bichiarist direction.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So, when cognitive concepts began to gradually come first in organizational behavior,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
then Kelley was mentioned.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Indeed, a great deal of attention is paid to cognitive abilities of a person.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
A person can be taught everything we want and do it quickly.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But to do it through the thinking of a person, through his cognitive apparatus.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Kelley came from the fact that any person can be considered as a naive researcher.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
What do we do in our life when we study, when we meet someone, when we fill ourselves with bumps?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000
We form certain cognitive ideas about what is good, what is bad, what is useful, what is harmful,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000
what is socially demanded, what is socially unacceptable.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
What is the choice that any of us makes when entering a higher educational institution?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:07.000
It was a certain kind of rating, where it became clear from the point of view of social needs,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
where we have more prospects for obtaining the desired result.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:25.000
No wonder there is a great excess of economists, lawyers and psychologists.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
This is what was considered to be in demand.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Therefore, relevant faculties were opened, people went to study,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and now they are in the labor market, not in demand.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And at the same time, there is a lack of engineers, technical specialists,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000
who also received further development, but these professions were not in demand at the time.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Therefore, the training of the necessary specialists was not carried out.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
So, Kelly comes from the fact that any person can be considered as a naive researcher.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
What is the introduction of a person into life?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
The introduction of a person into life is a search and analysis of those situations,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000
those circumstances, which I can apply my activity to, and in which I can be successful.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:29.000
A person looks at different behavioral patterns, at different behavioral models,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000
at different cognitive maps, what I need to do to get the desired result.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And then, having typed these cognitive maps, but typing them in the head, in the virtual image, in the virtual space,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
naturally, if I enter the university, I have no experience yet, I cannot understand that after graduating from the law university,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.000
will I become a successful lawyer or will I be, let's say, not quite a legal specialist in demand?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I still can't understand that.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:15.000
But I already have a certain set of options in my head, that I can become a lawyer, an economist, a sociologist, a scientist, a businessman.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And, accordingly, I already begin to try those or other options on myself.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I have the possibility to choose from different options.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And this position is called constructive alternativism.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
There are certain mental constructs that are present in my head.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And there are certain alternatives to which the implementation of these constructs, these thoughts, these ideas, these cognitive schemes,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
the principal cognitive schemes, they are not yet in reality, they are only in our head.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
There are certain alternatives to which these constructs can lead.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Therefore, I must make a choice, a choice of those mental constructs that are in my head.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Here is a simple but basic idea of Kelley.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
We really observe and, based on observation, we form maps of reality, cognitive maps.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And then we choose which of these maps suits us and which of these maps we would like to follow.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:37.000
At the same time, Kelley comes from the fact that the main cognitive mechanism of a person, the main cognitive education is a personal construct.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It is a dichotomy that comes from comparison and distinction.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
There is some element, for example, salary.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And, accordingly, I can assess that if I become a lawyer I will get a high salary.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Accordingly, this is what I want to strive for, what I want to be like.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And there is another alternative.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I can become a teacher, a doctor, a budgetary, as it is called, and get a corresponding salary.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
This is a difference.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yes, I have to study for the same amount of time.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But in one case I get one salary that I want to get, and in another case I get another salary that I don't want.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
A dichotomy and a distinction.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
This is what a personal construct is.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It is a comparison of the element I want, of the approach I want, of what I want to achieve and of what I don't want.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I don't want to be equal to anything.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So, here is a bipolar construct.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
There is always an element of similarity, which I want, and an element of distinction, which I don't want.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
In this case, Kelly naturally comes from logic.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
There is a desirable result, and there is an undesirable one.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
This is black and white logic.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Of course, one can say that a person is not so easy to please.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But Kelly talked about this in the mid-1950s, and he was the first to build organizational behavior on these mental schemes.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Now, in the 21st century, one can, of course, highly relate to his approach, but nevertheless, he was the first.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The main postulate of Kelly's theory is very simple.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:42.000
In general, Kelly came from the fact that the principles on which he built the organizational theory should be clear.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Just because a person chooses constructs that are clear to him, one can say a lot of beautiful words,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
which will be clear only to scientists, and to others it will be unclear.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:08.000
If I consider a person as a naive researcher, I use clear terms, without any doubts about the concepts that science loves to deal with.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The main postulate of Kelly is that the subject's activity, all his subsequent actions, are determined by the ways he predicts the events to come.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Each of us builds predictions, each of us builds his own goal, his own system, his own system of life vision, of seeing himself in a few years.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Depending on the goal I set for myself, I try to achieve it.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That means I have to build my behavior, my activity in order to achieve the desired goal.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Again, there is a lot of things we've talked about, about the programming of Skinner, Baldur, Tolman.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But Kelly emphasizes that all these predictions are made in a thoughtful way.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
It's not necessary to build a wall.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000
We can look at what others do and build an acceptable behavior line for ourselves.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:40.000
In common sense, it's like an old thesis that a smart person learns from other people's mistakes, and a non-smart person learns from his own mistakes.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It's right, but everyone wants to be smart and not make their own mistakes.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Moreover, Kelly emphasizes that a human existence is a principled cognitive process.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Non-behavior, as it's been stated since the times of Watson, Skinner, Tolman, and Baldur, is not behavior.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yes, behavior is a cognitive process, and behavior can be judged by what a person does.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But all human activity is cognition.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Any person explores what's going on, gains experience, and focuses on the circumstances he's in.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
How is this cognition done?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:42.000
It's done by imagining or representing those or other events in our head.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
We imagine the consequences that may occur.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.000
We imagine the results, the desires that may arise.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And we build our activity according to the desires or non-desires of those events.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Only by analyzing and predicting what we're doing in our head, we build our behavior.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:23.000
The next important thing that Kelly says is that constructs don't exist by themselves.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
We've talked about this a lot at the beginning, about scientific knowledge and methodological research.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
There are no separate ideas.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
All our personal constructs are interconnected.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
They are based on our experience, ideas, successes, and failures.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:50.000
These constructs are what we've gained as a result of our life, our achievements.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And they complement each other.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
It's a kind of interconnected network.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
If a person is healthy, his constructs flow out of each other.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000
If the constructs are separated, it's a sign of psychological disorders.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Psychiatrists often face this problem.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But I hope we shouldn't discuss it.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Again, when talking about constructs, Kelly emphasizes that this network is gained by a person as a result of his active cognitive activity.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:40.000
A person is not a passive tool of influence.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.000
It's not a black box that was influenced by a stimulus and it gave a reaction.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.000
A person receives stimuli, analyzes, processes, predicts, evaluates, and then produces a result.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Only after he actively worked on them.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
He tried something, got something and gave a reaction.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Kelly emphasizes that every personal construct is nothing more than a hypothesis.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:29.000
A person makes assumptions, a prediction about how successful his actions or behavior will be.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
A person thinks, why should I spend time to study MBA?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
What else do I need? What can I learn?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
When I can give a forum to anyone.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
A person makes a hypothesis.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
These hypotheses may seem right or not.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:57.000
If a person makes a hypothesis that as he gains new knowledge, new systems, new skills,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
he becomes more successful, it makes a progress in his business,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
and he achieves a better result,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
and yes, he will spend a lot of time after work to gain new knowledge,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
but then all this will be spent, it's one thing.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I can formulate another hypothesis.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What will I learn?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I already have two or three higher education.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Why should I spend time?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
This is also a hypothesis.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And the investigation will be made from it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And I will organize my behavior according to the hypotheses I make.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000
In this case, the problem of correct formulation of a hypothesis arises.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
The most significant components are identified.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
The correct variables are identified.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
In this case, speaking about the KELY concept,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
we return to the scientific methods of research.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yes, any person, a naive researcher,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:00.000
but a naive research is a reflection of the points that are specifically specified in a scientific research.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
We are all researchers in this life.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We all gain experience from our mistakes,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
we all gain experience from observations,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
we all make our plans and we get certain hypotheses.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
How successful these hypotheses will be,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
it will be based on the results we get.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
This is what concerns the cognitive approach in organizational behavior.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
These are the directions that are widely used today,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
including a large number of trainings.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
They were called cognitive trainings,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
which are not aimed at developing skills,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
like bifurcation trainings,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000
but are aimed at teaching a person to mentally,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
cognitively model successful forms of behavior

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and to learn to behave like a successful model,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the model you chose yourself.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Unlike behavioral trainings,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
the result may not come out quickly.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
In behavioral training, I clearly know what result should be obtained,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and I know how to bring you to this result quickly.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
This is about constructive alternative.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You choose a model that will be useful to you from your point of view,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and you go to this model.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Your hypothesis may seem wrong,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and this model will not lead to the desired result.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
But only you can figure it out,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
only you can get it

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
after you take some steps to get this result.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It does not mean that you should constantly go in the chosen direction.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You should be flexible.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You should get feedback and change your behavior

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
depending on the results you get.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
This is where this very interesting and interesting connection

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
of behavioral and cognitive approach comes in.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
In the end, all our personal constructs,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
all our plans and behavior patterns,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
lead to a certain behavior.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Plans are for us.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Others look at our results, at what we do.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And, of course, if we formulate something in our heads,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.000
we need to get a certain result.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
The result that will please us first,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and secondly, others,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
because it is others who will evaluate this result.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
This is how the connection of cognitive and behavioral theories is formed.
