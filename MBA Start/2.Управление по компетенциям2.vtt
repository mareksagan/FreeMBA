00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
As a result of such activity on the development of exercises, you should get a matrix of assessment.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Paying your attention to the slide that you see now,

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
when the entire list of those competencies that you have is presented, 8, 10, 12,

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
and the exercises that are available will be determined.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
You will always be able to understand which competencies and which methods you have the opportunity to assess.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide where, as an example, the competence of working with clients is given,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
and the methods of assessment that the company has in stock are listed.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
This is from the filling of the assessment sheet by the 360-degree method,

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
and as we can see that instead of the subordinate, the client is participating here, assessing the employee.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
This can be a written assessment of the knowledge of the assortment and the work technique,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
work with clients, that is, an assessment of knowledge.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
This is a business game that is developed based on the situation that took place.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
And also this is a case that is offered to the participants to decide.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Again, someone else for this competence can offer some other methods.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Maybe there will be only two of them, maybe three, and they will be completely different.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
In this case, we see a choice of a specific company.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
When the staff understands that in order to assess the competence of working with our employees,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
these methods are available.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So, we have assessed our employees.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
We have laid out the requirements for the level of development or the profile of the position on our axes,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
and then applied the current level of competence development of our employees.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
We receive information for analysis, and we need to use this information.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
How can we use it?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
We can either make an individual plan and programs for each employee.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
We determine which employees we will represent in the personnel reserve.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Speaking of the personnel reserve, it is important to understand that if we define a group for ourselves,

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
the group can be very large, or the positions can be different.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
This does not mean that we have presented the whole group in the reserve for all positions.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Absolutely not.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
We remember that in order to be listed in the personnel reserve and for subsequent development,

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
it is necessary to assess, or assess again, or impose the assessment that we have made,

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
but already to the level, to the profile of competence of the position under which we select the reserve.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
This does not mean that everything is again, everything is from the beginning.

02:47.000 --> 02:57.000
Because if we represent an employee in the reserve, in, say, a higher position,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
then these are positions within the same group of positions.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Therefore, there will be the same corporate competencies, the same professional competencies.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
The only thing that can be added is managerial competencies.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
If the employee did not engage in management activities in the previous position,

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
so we can or plan to list those people whom we list in the personnel reserve.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
We suggest that they go through another exercise,

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
within which we will observe the level of development of their management competencies for subsequent assessment.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
The next one is the planning of the employee's career.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
This is an opportunity that we have, and we can understand and give feedback to the employee

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
so that he understands what he can expect while working in our company.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
This is the adjustment of compensation packages.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Here I also say, because the word adjustment is very soft,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
this is by no means a change in compensation packages.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What does this mean?

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I do not recommend you to change the labor payment system,

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
to increase the salary based on the results of the assessment of competencies.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Because we pay for the result, and competencies are still behavior.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
We should not pay for the demonstrated behavior, no matter how it sounds.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
It is clear that if the assessment of competencies is accompanied by the assessment of activity,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
then it can be the next step.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
In any case, be careful.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Remember that only for the results of the assessment of the assessment center,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
compensation packages should not be changed easily.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
There should be some other reason for this.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Let's talk about the use of competencies in the development of personnel.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
We have done a lot of work, we have evaluated,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
and we understand that there is a group of employees with a number of competencies,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
which we need to improve.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
We all together.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It is clear that they need to be improved.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
But we, if we are a personnel service,

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
need to create an environment and provide the tools that will help employees do this.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
First of all, we develop special training programs,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
whether individual or group, for the development of competencies.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
We can do this within our training centers or within the company,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
or we can attract external partners to achieve these goals.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
There are many methods of training, they are different.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
They are different in quality, they are different in duration, they are different in cost.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
Again, from these methods, we choose those that are acceptable for the development of specific competencies,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
specific employees in our companies.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Thus, we will have a so-called development action menu,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
or individual development plans.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
When we have certain methods for the development of a certain competence.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Remember, we had an assessment matrix there.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
How can we assess competencies?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The same thing here.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
The matrix of development actions.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
How can we develop this competence?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
What methods do we have?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The methods can be completely different.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It can be self-learning, it can be mentorship,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
as one of the most effective methods.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It can be participation in development projects,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
training and seminar.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
It can be participation or even holding some master classes,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
most likely within the company.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
It's not that we send an employee to teach someone,

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
but we say that if he has some professional knowledge,

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
and on the other hand, he needs to develop the competence related to communication,

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
work, let's say, a speech in front of an audience, and so on,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
then why not share his knowledge in this format?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It can be a development center.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
We talked about assessment centers.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
There is also a concept of a development center.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
The algorithm of the assessment is similar,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
but the goal is different.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
The goal is not to assess, but to train.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
When an employee performs an exercise,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
he immediately receives feedback.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Then, within the framework of the development center,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
he receives another exercise and an opportunity to demonstrate and improve his skills.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
The goal is not just to collect some information,

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
but to let the employee try to change his behavior

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
taking into account the feedback he received from the observers.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
It is important to remember that employees with high grades,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
that is, with a high level of competence development,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
regardless of their position,

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
they can and should perform as functional coaches and mentors.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Moreover, it is a great advantage for the company

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
when the most valuable knowledge can be passed from one employee to another.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It is also a plus for the employee, a kind of advantage,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
because it is connected with his inner motivation,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
including the fact that he becomes an internal or functional coach.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Not to mention that if the company has a mentor stimulation system,

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
it will always be an additional benefit.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Speaking of competence development,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
we cannot help but talk about the competencies that are difficult to develop.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Some people call them undeveloped competencies,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
but this name probably has a certain predisposition,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
because if we call it competence,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
we must accept that what has grown has grown.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What level of competence development does the employee have?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
We should always work with this.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Of course, there is a part of irony in this,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
because undeveloped competencies are those competencies,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
within which it is quite difficult to change a person's behavior.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Nevertheless, we must understand whether such competencies exist in our model.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Loyalty.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
How much can it be? How will we evaluate it?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
How will we develop it?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
How can we tell a person to be loyal if we want him to behave this way?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's not that simple.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Such competencies can be different.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
For example, the competence of creativity.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Competencies are not often found.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
It can be found in small creative organizations,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
or it can be a professional competence of a group of employees.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Nevertheless, at the stage of the formulation of competencies,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
answering the question of how we can analyze

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
and whether we can develop this competence in the future,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
we should think about it.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
And, consequently, understand that it is one of such competencies.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
What tools do we have?

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
The first is to analyze and select people at the entrance to the company for these competencies.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
That is, not to miss people who do not have the level that we need,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
if this competence is a priority.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Also, develop a system of stimulation.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
If we use not only development tools,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
but also tools from another field,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
that is, the behavior that we consider necessary.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
And also, try to determine the methods that may be.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Among them there may be coaching,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
among which there must be feedback.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
If a person is interested in developing this competence,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
he has an inner desire,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
then this method will be very effective,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
because he will receive feedback from a colleague,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
from a manager, or from some internal expert.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
And he will change and consciously change his activity in the direction that is necessary.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
A few words about the personnel reserve,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
which we have already talked about today.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
First of all, it is necessary to determine for ourselves

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
what we understand as a personnel reserve.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Historically, we understand the personnel reserve as a reserve for a position,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
for any of the positions.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
It can be either a management reserve,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
that is, when specialists are formed,

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
reservists are formed for the position of a manager,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
or from the manager of the lower link,

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
a reserve is formed for the position of a higher level manager.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
Nevertheless, there is a concept that has become part of our language today,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
which we read a lot in literature.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It is the management of talents.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
When we form the so-called talent pool,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
what is it about?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Is there any difference?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Most often, those companies that adhere to this principle

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
and say that we are not just forming a reserve for a certain position.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
No, we select talented specialists from different fields.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
We evaluate them by defining a talent for ourselves in a certain way,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
and most often as a potential for development.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
We already understand that this is a certain set of competencies.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
We define these people for ourselves

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
in order to pay more attention to them during our work with the staff

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
and understand that this is our future

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
and that it is more efficient for us to invest in this particular category of employees.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
In this case, the talent pool is not for a specific position.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
There is no profile of the competence of the chief engineer,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
the reserve for which we are forming.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
There is a certain scope for the future,

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
or a certain profile of success, as some companies call it.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Thus, it is necessary to define the direction in which we work.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Either we have a reserve for a position,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
or for a managerial position,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
or for a position of a specialist, a rare specialist,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
who is almost not on the market.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Let's say a technologist in our tricky production.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And we grow all technologists on our own.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Or, once again, a talent pool.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
In any case, we understand that we select candidates

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
for the pool and the reserve based on the results of evaluation events.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
We create individual development plans.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Only if we understand what to include in the development plan,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
because there is a profile of the position,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
in the reserve for which they are included,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
and we understand, comparing with their current profile,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
what competencies need to be developed.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
As for the talent pool,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
we are talking about a certain profile of success.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
When we set a certain level,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
maybe we draw profiles of a young manager,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
or we define for ourselves in some other way.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And we start from this profile,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
which we have defined for ourselves.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
For reservists, individual plans are made.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And it is very important that people,

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
who are listed in the reserve or in the talent pool,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
are not just listed once,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
but then in a year, two or three,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to see what happened to them.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
These are people,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
who we invest more money in,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
from the calculation of one employee,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
than in other employees.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Therefore, we need to constantly monitor

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
the effectiveness of our investments.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
What does it mean?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
This is the level of reserve preparation.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Six months have passed.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
We gave recommendations to employees.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Did any change happen or not?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
This is something that must be monitored.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There are two aspects.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
The first one is very slow and fast reserve preparation.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
If the reserve is medium-term,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
for example, for three years,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and we prepared it for a year,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
but in a year we do not need

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
any specialist in this area,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
what can happen?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Everything can turn out great.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
The employee will say thank you,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
will spread his wings

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and will continue his career in another organization.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Therefore, you must feel this balance,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
initially programming the reserve period,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
for which we are preparing.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
The benefits that the organization gets

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
when forming and developing the personnel reserve

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
cannot be overestimated.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
First of all,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
we must understand

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that this is a systematic and targeted development

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
of a certain group of employees.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
That is, money is invested in the best.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
As we assume,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
we do everything to maximize

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
the return on these investments.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
The reservists themselves understand

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
what the company expects from them

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
if they have individual plans

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
or plans for future careers.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Thus, the best of them

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
purposefully strive to meet these expectations.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
The second aspect is

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
that the company is not a company

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
that is based on expectations.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Further, the corporate culture of the company

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
is gradually changing.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It becomes oriented to personal development,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
to initiative, to creativity.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
That is, it appears in the hands of

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
linear managers and staff.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
A real tool for working with employees

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
appears,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
increasing their loyalty

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and involvement in business.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It can also be said

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
that there is a transition

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
of personnel service

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
to a different quality level of development.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Thus, both the organization

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
and the personnel service

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
as a guide and an agent

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
of such changes win.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Let's pay attention

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
to the next slide,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
where the cycle of corporate training

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
or training system is presented.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And again, we will touch

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
on this issue

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
in application of our topic today,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
namely, the competence model.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Very often,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
HR has a task

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
to develop

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
a training system.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
The first step

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
that needs to be taken

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
is to analyze the needs

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
of the employees in the training.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
There are many methods

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
of analysis of needs.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
One of them

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
is the competence assessment.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Therefore, you often see

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
HR and personnel service

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
are engaged in competence assessment.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
We need to develop

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
competence models.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Then they either start

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
the big way

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
we are talking about today

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
or they use other methods.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
In fact, the most valid

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
and objective is

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
the competence assessment.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
If we have these competences,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
we take this step very easily.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Because, according to the dogma

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
of assessment events,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
all the needs in the training

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
become clear

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
and we can work with them.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The next element of the system

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is the training planning.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
When we understand

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
who, how and in what period we are learning.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The next step is the development of programs.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
How we will develop

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
competence.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
After that, it is the training.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That is, the application of the methods

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
we have listed.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And the most important thing is the effectiveness assessment.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
The effectiveness assessment

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
is the final element

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
of the corporate training system.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Look,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
the assessment of efficiency and competence.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
What is their relationship?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Let's remember

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
what methods we have for the assessment of

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
the effectiveness of training.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
When it comes to the assessment of the effectiveness of training,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
we most often remember the name

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
of Donald Kirkpatrick,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
an American specialist,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
who 30 years ago proposed

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
the technology of assessment of the effectiveness of training.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Now in the literature we know it as the Kirkpatrick model

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
or the four-level model.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
What is its essence? Let's remember.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
In general, when it comes to the assessment

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
of the effectiveness of training

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
or some training program,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
we always have to ask ourselves

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
what we assess.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The training program itself,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
which lasted 16 hours,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
we assess it

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
or maybe we assess the coach who conducted it.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Or maybe we assess the participants.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Or we assess the whole process.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
We always have such a question.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
After all,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
our task is not to assess the program itself,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
but to assess the changes

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
that the training

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
led to,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
changes in the work of the participants.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Because it was the changes

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
that should have led

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
to the goal for which

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
the training program was conceived.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Thus,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Kirkpatrick proposed

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
to do the following.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
He said that we should first assess

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
the reaction of the students,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
that is, the emotions.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
After the seminar,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
let's ask how the participants felt.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Did they like the program?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Did they like the coach?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Was it convenient to use the distribution materials?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Was it hot? Was it cold?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Was it time to feed them lunch?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And so on.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
In general, it is a kind of assessment of emotions,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
an assessment of the perception of how we felt there.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
By making an analogy

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
with sports,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
we can listen to a lecture

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
of an outstanding football coach,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
absolutely not being a football player.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And we can come to delight and say

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
that it was great,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
it was so interesting.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
We spent two or three hours

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
with such a positive,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
that it was just great.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Class, we say,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
is an emotion.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Some time passes,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and we need to understand

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
what is left of our football lecture.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Do we remember,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
do we know the basic rules?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Or is there just some kind of inner feeling

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
about a well-spent time?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Only if the football lecture

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
can be like this,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
then it should not be like this with professional training.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Therefore, our next task is to understand

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
what knowledge is left in the head of the participants.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
If we have taught

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
operators of the call center

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
to work effectively,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
we need to understand.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
We did not come here

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
with the feeling

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
that the class had a great time.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
This was not the goal.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
The goal was the second level, knowledge.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
What knowledge is left in their heads?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The next level is that there is little knowledge.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
We can know how to play football,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
but none of us will ever

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
go out on the field.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
The same can be known

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
how to work with objections.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And the sales manager

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
may be hard to breathe

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and may be very angry.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
But knowledge does not always

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
imply skill.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
We know how to do it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
The question is whether we do it.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
A specialist who has been working with people for 30 years

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
asks us whether it works.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Therefore, the next level is the level of behavior.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
How much behavior has changed

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
after the training

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
that was conducted.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
What is behavior, colleagues?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It is competence.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Therefore, having reached this level,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
we can say that

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
this is the most fixed change

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
in the development of competence

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
that we can analyze.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Has there been a change?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
No.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Thus, it is very easy for those companies

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
whose competence model exists

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
to reach the third level of efficiency

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and behavior.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It is not very easy,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
but it is easier than for other colleagues.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Because there are all the tools.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We have developed,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
we have conducted an assessment center,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
we have evaluated, we have seen

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
what was at the entrance.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Therefore, having conducted repeated procedures

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
after a while, we will be able to analyze

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
what will happen next, whether there are changes.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Can these changes be attributed

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
to the training program that we conducted?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The next point

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
for our picture

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
to be completed

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
is the fourth level of efficiency,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
what results,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
business results

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
have led to new behavior.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Our call center operators,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
whom we trained,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
who liked everything,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
remembered and began to serve the client better.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
What did this lead to?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
This led to the fact that they began to serve

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
more clients per hour,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
that clients became more satisfied

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
with the work of our call center.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
This is a business result

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
that we record

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and which is a consequence

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
of the development of competence

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
To conclude the topic

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
of competence in the development of staff,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it is necessary to recall

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
what benefits our company gets.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
In those companies

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
where the staff

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
uses competence

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
when forming a system of training

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
and development of employees,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
the employees themselves clearly begin to understand

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
what competencies are necessary for their career growth.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
They understand what they need to do

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
to make their work

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
evaluated positively.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
What are the results

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
and what is the required behavior?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The managers

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
have a clear idea

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
of what their employees were trained for.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
They also clearly understand

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
what they can demand from employees.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The staff service

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
generally receives a good tool

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
to assess the effectiveness

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
of the funds and investments

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
that are invested in training.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Let's talk about

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
the use of competence

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
in the development of staff.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
When we conduct an interview with an employee,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
our task is to assess

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the development of his competence

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
in 40 minutes,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
an hour, or an hour and a half

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
in accordance with the position

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
he is in.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
We have a limited time.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
We did not know anything about the employee before.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
There is no prehistory of our relations.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Therefore, the assessment

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
should be as accurate as possible.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
We must make every effort

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
to attract employees

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
who will not stay

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
in our company.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
These are direct costs

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
that our company is incurring.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The selection of employees

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
is the most accurate

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
if we assess them

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
by competence.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
There are two main methods

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
that we use.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
The first is an interview by competence.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
The second is the assessment centers

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
that we have already talked about.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
In this case,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the assessment centers will be individual.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
The advantage of an interview

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
by competence is

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
that our questions

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
will be based on the analysis of the work

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and will be aimed at identifying

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
the skills required

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
for the work

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
our candidate is applying for.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
The next advantage is

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
that the information received

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
during the interview

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
will be easier to structure

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
and to assess.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
We can easily assign

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
the level of development

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
demonstrated by the employee

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and the information we will gather

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
during the interview

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
to the competence

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
that is in his or her profile.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Unfortunately,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
there are disadvantages.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The first one is the long duration

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
of the interview.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
In this case,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
it is important to use

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
a method of pair comparison.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Before preparing

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
for the interview

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
and selecting the candidates

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
for a certain position,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
we will identify the critical competencies

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
together with the supervisor.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
What is the priority?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
What competencies should be there?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
In the absence of these competencies,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
we can close our eyes

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and understand that we will simply

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
teach this person.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Sometimes, when I select a sales manager,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't need a person

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
to know the product,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I need him to sell well.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Thus, this competence

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
is more important.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Another person says that

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
he needs to know the product

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
because it is specific,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and I will teach him to sell it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Different situations, different supervisors

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and, thus,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
maybe in something similar

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
competencies,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
critical or priority competencies

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
will be absolutely different

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
and opposite in these two cases.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
We talked about the matrix of assessment,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
we talked about the matrix

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
of developing actions.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
We also need to have a matrix of questions,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
that is, the questions

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
that we will use

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
to identify the competencies

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
that we need.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
The difficulty is that

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
the candidate can exaggerate a little.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Perhaps he will not tell

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
what he did himself,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
how someone did it,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
giving it as if it were his own projects.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Therefore, we must initially prepare,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
come up with those questions,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
maybe formulate those small tasks,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
the answers to which

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
will immediately allow us to determine

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
whether the candidate says

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
what he knows,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
or he tries to improvise right away,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
because he has never done this before.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The easiest way

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
is to formulate questions

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
aimed at identifying

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
professional competencies.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
For example, we will ask the sales manager

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
to give as many solutions

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
as possible for the situation

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
when the client requires a discount

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
that he cannot give.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Regardless of the product,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
regardless of the specificity of the company's activities,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
either the person knows how to do it

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
and understands the options

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
that he has,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
or it becomes difficult for him

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
because he has never worked before

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
and has always solved

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
the situation with the client

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
by his manager.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It is more difficult to talk

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
about management competencies

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and corporate competencies.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
That is why it is necessary to ask

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
situational questions,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
to propose various situations,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
to reveal how a person would behave

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
in this situation,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and how he behaved

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
when these situations

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
occurred during his previous work.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Thus, listening to the answers

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
to these questions,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
we get a set of positive

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and negative indicators

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
applicable to the competencies

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that we analyze.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
This will allow us

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
to analyze the notes

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
that we have left

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
and make a preliminary conclusion

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
about the development

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
of the competencies

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
of the candidate.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
For example,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
evaluating the competence

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
of the result orientation,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
we can ask the candidate

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
what professional goals

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he sets for himself for the next year,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
how ambitious these goals are for him,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
what difficulties he can foresee

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
in achieving these goals,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and what can prevent him

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
from fulfilling his plans.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Thus, listening to his answers

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
and thinking,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
we get a list

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
of positive indicators.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
We can say that this person

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
sets goals for himself,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
he plans a career for the long term.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
These goals may not be

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
professional goals,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
but they may be personal.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Or we get a list

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
of negative indicators.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
When we say that

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
we understand that

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
it is clear from the examples

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that a person has no goals

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
or that he cannot set them,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
setting some goals

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
for his desire,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
we get some information

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
for analysis.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
When we analyze

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
either a list of negative indicators

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
or a list of positive indicators,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
we understand

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and we can evaluate

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
the level of competence development

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
of the competence

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
that we have analyzed,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
the result orientation

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
of this candidate.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Then we compare it

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
to the position.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
We evaluate

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
the level of competence

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
that this person needs

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
to be oriented.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Then we understand

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
whether this competence

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
was named as a priority.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Thus, we get a tool

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
for comparing different candidates.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
To conclude the topic

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
of competence models,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I will repeat

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
that the most profitable

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
are those companies

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
where competence model

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
is a core in the management system

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and all functions

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
are integrated

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
with each other.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Thus, a company

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
can become more flexible,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
more mobile and better react

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
to changes in the environment.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Because, again,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
if we review competence

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
after some time,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
we see that all our HR policies

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
will be adapted

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
to the changes

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
that occur

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
if competence is a key tool.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It is often heard

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
that competence exists,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
but it does not work.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
When you start to think

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
why they do not work,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
the reasons for this

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
are, most likely,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
resistance from the management

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
employees

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
or the fact that they

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
simply ignore competence.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Why does it happen?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
There may be a number of reasons

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
why competence does not work.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Let's think

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
what it is.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The first reason

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
why competence does not work

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
is the unreasonable reason

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
of their development and implementation.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
When a company developed competence

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
not because it is necessary,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
perceiving it as a future

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
for management,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
but because everyone does it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I heard at a conference

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that a competing company

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
has competence.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Why not make it ourselves?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
They also have interesting competencies.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
How do they suit us?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
After some time

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
competence appears in the company.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It becomes clear

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
that there was no reason for it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Why is competence not a good tool?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Why is it not a good tool?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
The second reason

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
is that some mistakes

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
were made

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
during development.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Maybe the model is too complex?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Maybe we tried

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
to describe all the standards

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
of behavior that we have

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and we got 20 competencies?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Maybe it is too simple?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
There are only 4 of them

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and employees do not understand

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
how their competencies

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
affect their work.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
There are competencies,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
but what are they?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I say, there can be 4 competencies

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
if we only define corporate

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
or management.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Then it should be

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
brought to employees

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
in the right way.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The next one.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Maybe the model is poorly adapted

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
for business tasks

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and it does not meet

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
the goals of the company.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Maybe it is borrowed

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
from the company.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Or maybe the competencies

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
are wrong.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
When we talked about

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
whether the standards of behavior

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
that we describe

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
lead to high results

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
of the employees who have them.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
The next one.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
There could be mistakes

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
during the implementation.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The most common mistake

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
is that

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
the employees do not understand

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
the purpose of competencies.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
But there are some.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The staff has assessed

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and written something.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
But the understanding

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
that it is how to behave

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and work is not always there.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Maybe the management

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
does not consider them important.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It means that

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
there was not

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
the maximum attention

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
to involve

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
the managers in the process.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It is important

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
that the managers feel like their own.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
If they cannot participate

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
in all stages for some reason,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
it is important to gather

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the managers before

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
announcing and implementing.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
To imagine, answer their questions,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
listen to their comments,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
make changes, talk again.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
The managers should understand

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
that they also participated.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
The size of the participation

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
is not integrated

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
into other management systems.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
What does it mean?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
We developed competencies,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
we assess them,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
we select people

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
as we did 10 years ago.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
There is no question

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
about competencies.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But why?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It is easy to develop profiles,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
questions, exercises

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
and use them during selection.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Maybe we did not have time

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to develop them.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
There are many reasons.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Both during development

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and implementation.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Why did we not develop competencies?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
The next reason

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
why the model of competencies

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
may not work is

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
that it was developed

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
in a difficult time for the company.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
What do we mean by difficult time?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It may be restructuring,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
it may be a period

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
when the company

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
is facing financial difficulties.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It may be another aspect.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
There are no financial difficulties.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But there are many significant changes

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
in the company.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Maybe the shareholders

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and management change.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
There are other projects.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
This project is lost

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
and it does not get the attention it deserves.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
The next reason

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
why competencies may not work

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
is that they are misused.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
We are talking about cases

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
when competencies are used

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
as a strict list

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
of assessments.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
There is no flexibility in their use,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
which is unacceptable.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
There are cases

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
when the behavior indicators

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
of certain companies are replaced

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
by the interpretation of the managers

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
of the assessors.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
When the managers put into competencies

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
the meaning that is understandable

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
and close to the meaning

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
that was suggested

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
by the group of developers.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
It is important to track this point

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and to control it.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
You should keep your hand on the pulse

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and train the managers

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
and talk to them

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
and help them

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
in using this model.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
What else should we pay attention to

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
when working with competencies?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
First, competencies can intersect.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
To check whether competencies

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
intersect,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
you should determine

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
and assume

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
whether two employees

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
can work in the company

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
where one of the competencies

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
exists at a high level of development

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and the other is absent.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And vice versa.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
If we can answer the question

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
that competencies do not intersect,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
if there are difficulties,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
we say that competencies

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
have something in common.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
There are two ways to do it.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Either we refuse one of the competencies

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
or we somehow

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
include one in the other.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Next, competencies can be very complicated.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
When we try to determine

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
the maximum number

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
of behavior indicators for them

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
and thus

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
the competencies

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
become

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
incomprehensible to the perception.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Next,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
it is contradictory competencies.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
When competencies contain statements

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
that contradict each other.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
For example,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
describing the managers

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and how the manager makes decisions

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
can be a behavior indicator

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
such as

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
the manager

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
makes decisions and takes responsibility.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And then,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
when making decisions,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
he consults with colleagues

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and listens to the opinion of his subordinates.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It is clear that these are things

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
that contradict each other

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and that is why competencies

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
need to be analyzed

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
otherwise it will be difficult to apply them.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
The next point is

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
when competencies incorrectly

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
determine standards.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And the mistake is

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
that competencies are not divided

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
at the level

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
of qualified and unqualified performers.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
That is, people who have

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and do not have competencies

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
receive the same rating.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
This is again about the formulation.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Therefore,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
at the stage of formulating the list

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
you should ask yourself about this question.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
The next point is when competencies

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
in their definition as indicators

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
contain not actions, but results.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Colleagues, once again.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Competencies are the characteristics

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
of the personality that we

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
can measure at the behavioral level.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Thus,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
in defining competencies,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
we should always answer

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
the question of what does.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
But in no case

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
should we describe

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
some goals

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and some results

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
that a person with this competency

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
should achieve.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
We can say

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
that the model of competencies

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
is successfully implemented.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
But first of all,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
when it is constantly being improved.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
When employees discuss competencies

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
that are necessary for their work.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That is, competencies

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
themselves are included in professional slang.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And employees operate them.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
If you hear

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
when one employee

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
says to another,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
but now you have not shown

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
the competence of working in a team,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
it means that competencies

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
have entered your corporate slang.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It has become the language

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
in which you began to speak.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
This is one of the indicators of success.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And of course, we can talk about success

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
when our managers

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
or departments of the middle

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
or higher level

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
perceive competencies as a tool

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
of staff management that helps

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
them in their daily work.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
To summarize,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I will formulate several recommendations

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
about what is needed

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
for competencies to work.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
First of all,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
you need an objective reason

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
for creating and implementing competencies.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Second, you need to involve

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
line managers and employees

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
at all stages of work.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You need to organize a competent

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
internal PR project.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
That is, to inform about how and why

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
it happens, what benefit

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
the company, the line manager,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and the employees get.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It is necessary to teach

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
how to use competencies

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
and how to implement them.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
It is necessary to conduct a general

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
repetition of using competencies.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That is, when you evaluate

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
the developed competencies for the first time,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
you need to be flexible

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and test again

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
whether the competencies

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
you have formulated

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
are really those standards,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
those priority behavior standards

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
that are necessary for your company.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And the last one is a mandatory

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
integration of competencies

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
into all policies and procedures

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
of the staff management service.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Colleagues, I wish you success

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
and patience in implementing

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
this project in your companies.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I believe that the joint time

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
we spent together was useful.
