00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Valery Kazarin, professor of the Academy of People's Economy of the Russian Federation,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
pro-rector of the Moscow Open Law Institute and professor of a number of other simple universities.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences, State Advisor of the 3rd class.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
We have gathered here today to consider a number of issues related to the adoption of the new law.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
This is the topic of our meeting.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
We will start with the definition.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
What is meant by the administrative decision?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
There are three different things that are meant by the administrative decision.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
The first is the choice of the goal.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
The second is the path or the direction of the decision.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
The third is the process of the decision.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
The second is the path or the methods of achieving this goal.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
The third is the administrative decision.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Considering the administrative decision as an administrative decision,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
we can note two more aspects of this important point.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
One of the aspects is the choice of something.

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
The second is the process of making this choice.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Why is this topic important and simple at the same time?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
It is important because the decision-maker is responsible for it.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
If the decision is made wrong or ineffective,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
someone is subject to sanctions, including the organization.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Why is this topic simple?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We face this issue every day.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
We make decisions every day.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
What should we cook for breakfast or dinner?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Where should we cross the road?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
What traffic light should we cross?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Red or green?

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
After the general concepts, we will consider the methods of decision-making and classification.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
We will consider the new aspects of decision-making.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
And, of course, psychological issues.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
People of different psychotypes make decisions.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
We should pay attention to this when working with our colleagues,

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
superiors, subordinates who make and are responsible for some decisions.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Another term is the person who makes decisions.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
It is understood as a manager, that is, the one who leads.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
If a person does not make decisions, he is not a manager.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
But this is not enough.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
To be a manager, you need to have subordinates.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
So, the person who makes decisions individually is a manager,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
the leader who has subordinates.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
And there is another side,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
the collective person who makes decisions.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
That is, a part of the people, a certain circle,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
who make decisions together.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
We will discuss the issue of decision-making in a moment.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
But for now, let's move on to the concept of right and wrong decisions.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We often come across different examples.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
For example, on Tuesday, the president sent the government to resign.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Is this decision right or wrong?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Nobody knows today.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
In our course, I hope we will learn to make only right decisions.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I can share that as a professor of famous academies,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
who has long read the NIMB and conducted training,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I always make only right decisions.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Why?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
We will talk about this later.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So, what and how are decisions made?

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
In fact, the scheme of decision-making itself is very simple.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
This is the problem-solving.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
What is it?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And what do we need to solve?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
The second stage is, as a rule, the selection of criteria and restrictions

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
when solving this problem.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
The third stage is the development of alternatives,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
that is, the different ways in which this problem can be solved.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Then there is a choice of one or two of the ways,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
of the set that we have determined.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
And the implementation of the solution, of course,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
with a feedback to the original problem.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
In fact, these stages are broken up in different sources.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
There are many of them, and we can look and think,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
but the essence of this will not change.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Now let's look at the classification of decision-making.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
It also varies in different sources.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
First of all, management decisions are usually divided into external and internal.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
External decisions affect any changes outside the organization.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
For example, the development of new markets,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
as an example, the confrontation of competition,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
as an example, decisions aimed at, let's say,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
absorbing enterprises or creating branches.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
There are also internal solutions to internal problems.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
These are changes in personnel policy,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
changes in the assortment minimum,

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
changes in the price range due to changes in the costs within the organization.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
This is one component of the classification.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
It does not affect any other components of the classification.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Accordingly, if we look at the scale,

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
there are decisions made at the state level,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
decisions made at the level of the federation,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
they all affect our business and the management of our organization,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
the life of the general manager.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Decisions made at the level of municipal education

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
and decisions made in the organization itself.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
These are all management decisions at the hierarchy level,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
which affect the life and career of the first line manager,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
from which management begins.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Next, management decisions on time,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
their development and adoption.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
They are usually divided into strategic decisions,

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
tactical decisions and operational decisions.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
Strategic decisions consider a period of at least 3 to 5 years,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
and are associated with the strategy of the development of the entire organization.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Tactical decisions consider a shorter period of time, up to 3 years,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
from one year to three, sometimes from six months.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And operational decisions are those decisions that are made today,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
for a week, for a month.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
For example, operational decisions.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
New Year's Eve.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
The whole country celebrates the holidays, including Moscow.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And somewhere in a room on duty,

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
a brigade of duty plumbers and 3-4 plumber specialists are sitting.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And then a phone call comes in,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
that there was an accident on the heat networks.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
A huge heat network, a pipe, broke, and water flows out into the street.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It's cold at night, it's winter, people are celebrating.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
You need to make a decision for the plumber.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Who should be immediately pulled out of the table and sent to liquidate the breakthrough?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
What forces should be used, what services should be additionally attracted?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
This is an operational decision, it is already made quickly.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Further, decisions can be formalized,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
poorly formalized and not formalized.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
Formalized decisions are those decisions that are described using numbers, formulas.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
And are easily taken into account when processing on electronic computing.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
Examples of such a decision can be the decision to pay for newborns.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Because you can count how many men and women in our country,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
how many families, how many women of childbearing age,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
and how many women who are able to give birth further.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Count how much money will be spent from the budget

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
to provide all those women who are able to give birth with material stimulation.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
This is a formalized decision that was adopted at the state level.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
Poorly formalized decisions have a greater degree of uncertainty.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
No one can predict what the price of the dollar will be tomorrow.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
Or what consequences of price education on transport services and energy carriers

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
will cause changes in the government of the Russian Federation,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
which we have seen just recently.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
There are decisions that are not formalized,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
that are not formalized in some kind of electronic computing and calculation.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
For example, the decision adopted by the brigade commander

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
in the example of the New Year's Eve and the repair of the thermal power plant.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
Further, management decisions are divided into routine, creative and unique.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
What are the differences between them?

09:32.000 --> 09:41.000
Routine decisions are those that are adopted without any creative processes in the head of the person who adopts them.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
For example, the order to start the heating season is signed annually in the mayors,

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
in the administration and in a number of municipal organizations.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
What is creative here? Nothing.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
The order simply changes the dates,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
and the person can start working and start borrowing money for hot water.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That's it.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
These are simple routine decisions.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
Creative decisions differ in that something new needs to be developed here.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
For example, the company's exit to some new markets.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
What to go out with?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
What product?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Where to start?

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
To openly present yourself as a branch or to agree with someone on some commercial conditions.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Here you need to think and calculate.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
This decision can be both tactical, creative and poorly formalized.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Further, unique decisions are further development of creative decisions,

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
but they differ in that one such decision makes a turn of the company's life.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
For example, this is a classic example, it appears in textbooks.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Once cars were produced in small quantities as luxury.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Just for show.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You just drove a car and that's it.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
Once Henry Ford made a unique management decision to start mass production of cars.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Of course, it was unpopular at that time, and no one understood it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
But there were a lot of cars.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
There were horses, crews, horses, railways.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Why?

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Today we all just can't imagine our lives without cars.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Further, there are both periodic and non-periodic decisions.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Periodic decisions are those that arise constantly with a certain regularity.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
For example, the care of summer vacation employees.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Every year you need to decide who to let on vacation, when, and make a schedule.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It's all easy and simple.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
There are non-periodic decisions, like changing the price policy due to the change in the price of energy.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We don't know when they will change.

11:54.000 --> 12:04.000
If we have energy-efficient production, we have to react to such non-periodic changes in external indicators

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
by making appropriate decisions.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What to do and how to get out of it.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
There are also periodic and non-periodic decisions.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Periodic decisions are those that need to be made now,

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
like the decision of the brigade of plumbers and plumbers that we repair and apply.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And non-periodic decisions.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
For example, we need to decide what we will do in winter, in preparation for winter vacation.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
When children go to school, we could offer our company some food for children going on winter vacation.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
We have time to think, calculate, and determine methods of decision-making.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
Now, after the classification of decisions, let's look at several examples of such decisions.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Let's try to classify them.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Let's recall a very interesting situation.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Many people have read about the legendary hero of America, Thomas Sawyer.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Once his aunt sent him to paint a fence.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
We will come back to this example later.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Thomas Sawyer, having no desire to do it,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
he was a normal guy, not eager to paint fences,

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
came to this fence with a bucket of paint, a brush, and no desire.

13:27.000 --> 13:38.000
He painted it, noticed his friend, and asked him to paint it.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Thomas Sawyer persuaded his friend, convinced him,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and he started painting the fence with pleasure.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Then he passed it on to another friend, the third or fourth friend.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And this is how the process ended.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
The paint was used, the fence was painted in three and a half rows,

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Thomas Sawyer rested in the shade, ate delicious apples, and started to give a bunch of toys.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
The question is, what decision was it, internal or external, for Thomas Sawyer?

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
On the one hand, it was internal, because he did it for himself,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
he did not have an organization.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
On the other hand, it was external, because he brought in external resources to solve the problem.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
The problem was that the fence had to be painted without any desire.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Next, what level of hierarchy was this decision made at?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
It was made at the lower level, at the level of the executor,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
that is, at the level of the organization.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We look at it by level.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Next, what was this decision, strategic, tactical, or operational?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It was, of course, operational.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
He could not expect to be sent to paint the fence in the morning,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and on the other hand, having painted the fence,

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
it had no consequences for him in the future, in his development as a person.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
Next, on the formalizability and non-formalizability of this decision.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Of course, the decision was not subject to formalization, it was informal.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Next, on the routine and creativity, it was a creative decision.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
On the one hand, there was nothing unique to turn the world upside down,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
or Thomas Sawyer's life.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
On the other hand, it was new, and he had to think about it.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
This decision was not periodic, it occurred by chance, under the influence of external factors.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
And, of course, it was urgent.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
This is a simple decision.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Now, looking at how decisions are made, how they are implemented,

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
let's look at three more points, which concern the implementation of management decisions.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
Management decisions, of course, are the dream of every manager,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
to be decided in the best way possible.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The decision must be optimal.

15:57.000 --> 16:07.000
An optimal decision is when, having chosen some criteria for the second stage of decision making,

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
we reach the extremum when considering some function.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
This is either the maximum or the minimum.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
The optimum function exists.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Let's take a simple example.

16:22.000 --> 16:32.000
When the head of the department selects a team.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
The department decides to optimize the number of each unit,

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
when the number of units is determined based on psychological qualities.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Based on psychology, the department decides that the optimal number of units is 8 people,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
7 subordinates.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Why?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Because the maximum number of units of information

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
a normal person in a normal country can keep under control at the same time.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
7 people.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Okay, this is an optimal decision.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
There is another type of decision.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
This is an acceptable decision.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Some parameters do not allow us,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
let's say, the room parameters,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
the rooms that are determined by the sales department.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
Then we can make a group of 6-7 people.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
This is an acceptable decision,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
because the head will have 5-6 subordinates,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
they all get into the attention zone,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
into the control zone,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
he controls them normally.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
But he has one free will,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and he is underprivileged.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But the decision is acceptable,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
it is possible,

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
and the department can cope with the tasks set by the head.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
There is also a group of decisions that are called satisfactory.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
In the same example,

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
when we determine the number of sales units for the first line manager,

18:14.000 --> 18:21.000
as a rule, we have a number of subordinates in the country of 3-5 people.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Why?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
There are reasons for this, not psychological,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
but reasons for professional training,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
professional skills, knowledge and skills,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
and also the intellectual abilities of the head.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
As a rule, unfortunately,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
our managers hardly keep 6-7 people under control.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
3-5 is the norm.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
If we consider the structure of many companies,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
most of them are like this.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
When we start drawing the management work structure,

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
we make decisions on the creation of the entire management system of the organization,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
as a rule, we make small organizations,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
25 people, no more.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Because we are building with 25 people,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
we learn to find management decisions,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
how to distribute duties between departments in the best way.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
When we try to take more than 50 people,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
70 people, then unfortunately our groups are drowning.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Because of the training.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
When a person builds a small organization several times,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
it becomes easier for him to build for large ones,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
and when he comes to his organization,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
based on the skills and skills gained,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
it is possible to structure the work of the whole organization.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
We have an optimal solution,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
if we look at psychology,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
that is, 7 subordinates and a manager,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
that is, 8 people in the department.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
An acceptable solution,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
when the number of departments is not equal to 8,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
that is, from 6-7 people,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
in principle, up to 10.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
We can overload our manager with additional duties,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
additional people,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
with certain intellectual qualities,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
and this will be justified economically,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
according to the second criterion,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
according to another criterion,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
the criterion of the economy.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
When increasing the number of subordinates for each manager,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
we reduce the number of managers in the organization,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
and, accordingly, reduce the cost of salary

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
to the paid managers.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
This is beneficial for the organization.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
But this is the second criterion.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And according to the same criterion,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
the psychological composition of the group,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
we issue satisfactory solutions,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
which simply satisfy the conditions of the organization,

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
they do not exceed the psychological capabilities of our manager,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
and he works quite calmly.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
Now let's return to the person making the decision.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
As we have already said,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
as we know,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
the person making the decision can be a single person,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
an individual person,

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
and it can be a collective, collegial person making the decision.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
And, accordingly,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
before talking about them,

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
let's briefly consider how decisions are made in the main known models,

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
the American and Eastern models of management and business.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And, accordingly,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
they have their own culture of decision-making,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
which is formed by the whole system.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
So, in the American model of business management,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
each manager of this particular system

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
personally makes decisions and is responsible for them.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
This is the value of this model and the value of this manager.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
And, in fact, the value of the mentality of the United States of America.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
By the way, the Western model interpreted in the classic management

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
explains that it is supposedly in the middle

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
between the American model and the Eastern model.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
This is somewhat wrong in my opinion,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
because the Western model is a pro-image of the American model.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
The American model has grown out of it,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
but it has become a little tougher.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
The Western model has all the same principles as the American model,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
only it is softer, more kind, a little older,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and, accordingly, it has a softer character,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
like a person who is older, like a grandmother,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
she is much calmer than a 19-year-old lady.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Right?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
This is how it is with these models.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
The American model is tougher, but all the principles are the same.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
In fact, it can be said that in management

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
there are only two models of management,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
the American one, where the material is Eastern,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
and in them there are corresponding schemes for making decisions.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
So we move on.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
By the way, why are we moving on to this,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
to the consideration of how decisions are made in these models?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Maybe we don't need it?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Maybe we need it for this.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Many companies in our country are now signing contracts with foreign companies.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
We went abroad, we communicate with the West, with America, with the East.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
The Asian tigers that grow fast came to our country with different offers.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
On the one hand, on the other hand, our guys, growing managers,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
who are striving to make a career,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
often get a job in a foreign company,

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
both in a Western, pro-American, or purely American, or in an Eastern company.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And of course, to make a career in these companies,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
you need to know the rules of the game.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
So, as we know,

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
the manager makes decisions in the American model personally,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
usually without any responsibility,

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
often without consulting anyone, to the extent of his authority.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
He makes decisions, he is responsible for them.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
The decision is made quickly, it is quickly realized,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
and this has enabled the rapid growth of the American economy

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
after the creation of the United States of America

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
and after their transition to the capitalist economy.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
After all, America is actually younger than the whole mother Europe,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
but it developed quickly and took a leading position.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
That is, the entire American economy works better than the entire Western and even Eastern European economies.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
The difference between the East and the West is that decisions are made slowly.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Then all decisions are made collectively,

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
the so-called system of circular visioning.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
That is, a group of people is gathered, responsible at some level,

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
they discuss the problem, find solutions according to the scheme previously discussed,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
choose a solution, and then the solution is made.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
In fact, while the solutions can be strong, good, and optimal,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
no one personally answers for them.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
What was the weakness of the Soviet Union,

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
and what is our model in Russia today,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
American, Western or Eastern?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Western.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
But the West is not the same.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Then the East remained.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
We have an Eastern model.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We have a collegial decision-making,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
we have a prime minister who has a cabinet of ministers,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
who allegedly participate in decision-making.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
We have a collegium of public figures,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
heads of sub-departmental organizations,

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
who also meet periodically to make collegial decisions.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Let's take the simplest question.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Can you do it with my example?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
When I was doing my postgraduate studies,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
I had to write a document called a characteristic.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
It was signed by the head of the department,

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
the pro-fork department, the port-ork department, and the comm-sork department.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Four people.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
After that, I moved from the department to the faculty level,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
a little higher, to another level of management.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And there I was signed by the port-ork faculty,

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
the pro-fork faculty, the comm-sork faculty, and the dean of the faculty.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
It seemed that I could be congratulated on my postgraduate studies.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
This was the decision of management implementation.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
After that, the characteristic went to an even higher level,

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
to the top level, where it was signed by the chairman of the port-comm,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
the vice-chairman of the university's legal committee,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
the secretary of the university's committee of the LCCM,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
and the rector of the university's higher educational institution.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
In total, 12 signatures, plus the signature of the scientific director,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
who accepted me, 13.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Any person, any citizen of the Soviet Union in those years,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
in order to enter the postgraduate studies,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
according to the usual, simple, eastern model of decision-making,

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
had to have a good, at least, a friendly, comfortable relationship

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
with any official at any level.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
Any un-signed characteristic could slow down the decision-making.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And it would never be implemented.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
And no one would be responsible for it.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Here are two models.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
A person, choosing a company,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
moving to another job,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
finishing the MBA course with a master's degree in business administration,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
making a decision about the choice of a Western, American or Eastern company,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
has to look at himself first.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
How do I like to make decisions?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
How do I make them?

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
If I make decisions quickly, personally, and I am ready to answer,

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I go to the companies where the model of decision-making is in line.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And it will provide a fast career growth.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Especially having a master's degree in business administration.

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
If the technique, methodology and the mentality of a researcher

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
of a higher career position

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
often provides for consultations,

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
having colleagues, discussing the decision in a hurry,

28:38.000 --> 28:46.000
then you have to choose the company where the decisions are made in a proper way.

28:46.000 --> 28:52.000
Now we can look at another vivid example,

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
which was developed and published in one of our books,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
in Soviet times.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
A researcher compared the effectiveness of two decision-making models,

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
the American model and the Eastern model.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
The American model was taken by one of the very tough organizations.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
He examined the Italian mafia.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
How decisions are made there.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
What he noticed was that this work was not allowed to be published,

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
and only in Russia in the 21st century

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
some people managed to get into some aspects of this work.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The research was very extensive.

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
He saw that when a mafia soldier comes to his little boss,

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
he makes decisions himself,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
quickly, without consulting anyone, and answers for himself.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
He knows that if he made the wrong decisions,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
we are talking about right and wrong decisions again,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
then what is his fate?

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
If his boss finds out about his wrong decision,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
then his fate is decided.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
The legs are in the cement and the hand is in the river.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
All life in this tough system, in the competitive economy,

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
forced him to make the right decisions.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Those who could not make the right decisions,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
quickly stopped being little bosses.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Others took their place.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
A natural selection for Darwin.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
The strongest wins.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
Now, if a question asked to a little boss

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
goes beyond his competence,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and he has no right to make decisions,

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
he asks this question to his middle boss.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
How does the middle boss make decisions?

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
Of course, quickly, without consulting anyone,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
and answers for himself.

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
And he knows, like his little subordinate boss,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
that if he makes the wrong decisions,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
he will quickly stop being a middle boss.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Someone from the little bosses will replace him.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The system is mobile, fast,

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
and it allows this structure to function well

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
not only in the competitive economy,

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
but also in the pressure from the state police.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
If a middle boss suddenly meets a question

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
that he has no right to solve,

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
he passes it to the boss.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
He also makes decisions quickly,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
unilaterally, without consulting anyone,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and answers for himself.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
He answers for all his property and life,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
like all other structural fighters.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Of course, in a market economy,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
in a civilized market economy,

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
people who do not cope with their positions

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
and make wrong decisions,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
usually leave their positions,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
as a result of competition for jobs,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
but stay alive.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Now, our colleague, the researcher,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
compared this rigid structure

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
that makes decisions according to the American model

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
to another very rigid structure,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
but working in a different style.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
This structure was the Central Committee of the LCCM,

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
the All-Russian Leninist Communist Youth Union.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
The general-scale event was being prepared.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
This structure, which makes decisions

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
in the style of the Eastern model,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
prepared a document,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
where it was written who performs what,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
when, what resources are provided for it,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
and the collection of consent signatures began.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
If we need 13 signatures for a simple characteristic,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
then for that serious document,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
we needed more than 150 signatures.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
All signatures were collected,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
all signed signatures were positive,

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
no one dared to sign against it,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
but the event was not held.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Why were these two examples given?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Not to scold the Eastern model,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
it is strong in its own way.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
We know that the Japanese, Chinese, Korean,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Singaporean, even Vietnamese management

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
are very strong.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
They are rapidly developing,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
but the model is different.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
In the model in which the decision-makers

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
of the LCCM were making,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
no one was punished, no one was harmed.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
They checked it, and what?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
It did not work.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Just so we know how decisions are made,

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
we highlighted these two small aspects.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Having considered the two main models of decision-making,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
the two systems of decision-making,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and having considered the example

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
that characterizes both systems,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
let's move on to the qualification

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
of the manager,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
that is, the person making the decision,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
to see what decisions

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
he can make

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
depending on his qualifications.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
The first level, the simplest decisions,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
is called the routine level,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
where simple decisions are made,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
without even requiring a choice.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
On the one hand,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
we have already briefly mentioned

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
the classification of decisions.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
These are simple decisions

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
when the situation is known,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
repeatable,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
and you just need to get it done,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
signing an order,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
sending a letter, and so on.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
There is nothing new here,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
it is repeated,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and any novice manager

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
should be able to cope

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
with the tasks of this level.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The next level of decision-making

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
is the selective level.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
What is its peculiarity?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
The peculiarity is that

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
the person making the decision

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
chooses an option

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
from the number of options

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
available.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
If last year

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
the task of the person

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
was to choose

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
the best option,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
if last year

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
the task of reducing costs

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
was solved

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
by the personnel potential,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
if this year

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
the task was solved

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
by expanding

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the assortment of the product line,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
if the task was solved

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
in a different way

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
last year,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the person recalls

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
the options

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and decides to implement the decision.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
For example, it is not necessary

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
that the person takes care of his personnel.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Maybe it is better to take care of them.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Further,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
this is a slightly higher qualification,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
the person is able to choose,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
the manager is able to choose

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
something ready.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The next level of skill

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
is the decision-making

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
of the adaptation level.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And here

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
the skill is

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
that the person,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
seeing that

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
the ready options, decisions

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
are not related to the optimal

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
or permissible,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
but only satisfactory,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
tries to find a new decision.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
A decision that will allow

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
from satisfactory

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
to the permissible,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
and from permissible to the optimal.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
That's what it is.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Here

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
you need to be able

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to think creatively

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
and have a developed creativity

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
in speaking a psychological language.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
To generate new ideas,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
new approaches,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
and sometimes do what was not done before.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
For a simple example,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
at the beginning of the summer

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I was invited to Rostov.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
A colleague came to me

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and said that he needed my help.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I came and looked at the situation.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
He said that he had never done this before

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and could not do it.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I came to make a decision

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
that had never been done before.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
If you had found it without me,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
you would have done it yourself.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
So we did what was offered.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
A new decision that had never been

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
made in that organization before.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And even higher,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
the highest in the qualification

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
of the decision-making level

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
is the innovative decision.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Here,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
as in the example

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
with Henry Ford,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
you need to find something new,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
often unique,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
that gives a boost.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
If these innovative decisions

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
were made rarely,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
we would probably still be in the wild.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Such decisions were made

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
to create mobile phones.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Many years ago,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
working at a high pace,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
going somewhere,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
being late for a meeting,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I would call,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I would call and warn

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
or ask to postpone a meeting.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Now every schoolchild

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
uses this.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Someone once made a decision

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to create a new product.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Once, in Japan,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
in the eastern model,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
which was criticized

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
for making decisions,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
one of the managers

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
made a decision

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
to release audio players.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Many did not believe

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
that it would be successful,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and we are using them successfully.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
A more detailed characteristic

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
requirement for these decision-making levels

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
is shown on the slide.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Let us now

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
consolidate these levels

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
of the manager's qualification

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
for decision-making

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
with two more examples.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Both examples are related

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
to the organization of municipal transport.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
We all know what a trolleybus is,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
right? Let us talk about trolleybuses.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Both cases took place in the south,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
one in Krasnodar,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
the other in Rostov Oblast.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What was in Rostov Oblast?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
When designing trolleybuses,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
as was customary,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
they made a mistake

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and did not finish

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
one substation.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
The trolleybus line

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
could not operate.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It did not carry passengers.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
But the holiday was coming.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
What to do?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
We did not have time

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
to build a substation

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
from the ready-made solutions.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
We came up with a new

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
adaptation solution.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Let us celebrate

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
the holiday

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
with everyone.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Let us launch one trolleybus.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Let us put the best schoolchildren

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
from the best school in the city

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
in it.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Let us shoot it on TV,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
report it,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
congratulate, cut the ribbon.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And then, after the holiday,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
we will finish the rest.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
That is how we did it.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
We adapted the situation

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
to the problem.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
We found a way out

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
to make it tough.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
The system was tough in the East.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
The authorities were not being

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
pitied when they did not

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
implement the management solutions.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
The second example

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
of professionalism

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
was in Krasnodar.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
When the trolleybus line

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
was built in a remote

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
district,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
they had to design

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and build it.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
All the substations were

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
in their places.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
The trolleybus line

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
was a dead end

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
from one large enterprise.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It was a dead end

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
from the station.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
It was used

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
once or twice a month

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
when the wagons

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
were delivered

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
with raw materials.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
It was used at night.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
However,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
the project was required

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
to be approved

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
by the law.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The government

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
did not allow

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the trolleybus to be

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
allowed to run.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Everything was already built.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
The stations were built.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
The poles were built.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
The wires were connected.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It was time to

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
start the trolleybus.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It was clear that

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
the Ministry of Railways

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
did not care about

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
the municipality in Krasnodar.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
What should the Krasnodar

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
authorities do?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
They thought that

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
the solution was not possible.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
They could not adapt

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
the situation.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
A brilliant idea

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
came to the head

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
of one of the authorities.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
It was an innovative solution.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
In what sense?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
The project was decided

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
to divide the trolleybus line

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
into two parts.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The first part was from the city center

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
to the railway.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The second part was from the railway

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
to the end of the microdistrict.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
We have come to the holy

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
of holies of the governance

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
solutions.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
These are the methods of their adoption.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The methods of adoption

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
of governance solutions

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
are divided into three large groups.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Basically,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
each group of solutions

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
is discussed, implemented,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and adopted at a certain level

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
of governance.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
As we know from the classical

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
management theory,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
there are three levels of governance

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
all over the world.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
First line managers, middle managers,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and top managers.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
According to these levels,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
such methods were developed.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The first group of methods

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
of adoption of governance solutions

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
is called intuitive

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
or volitional.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
The second group

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
is mathematical methods.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
The third group

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
is creative methods.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So, what are the differences

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
between them?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Let's consider.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Volitional or intuitive methods

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
are adopted

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
based on some

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
thought processes.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
When an individual

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
thinks about something,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
solves an unformalized task,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
he can't explain

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
why and how

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
he made a decision.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
As in our example

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
with a brigade of investigators

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and plumbers

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
who sent two people

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
to close the dam,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
two to localize the leak,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and one to call

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
the additional services,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
it is unlikely

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
that he will explain why.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
He relied on qualifications,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
discipline, professionalism,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and so on.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But he made a decision

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
without expecting anything.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
There was nothing creative in it.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
It was just a simple

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
operative decision.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Often we make decisions

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
intuitively, without thinking.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
A person chooses

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
one of two or three tasks.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Someone makes

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
big tables of pros and cons

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
to make a right decision.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And sometimes

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
he makes a wrong decision.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
These decisions

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
are usually made

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
by a willpower,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
a leadership potential.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
These decisions are usually

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
made by first-line managers.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It is a simple decision.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
A person makes a table of tasks

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
for the participants.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
He made someone do something.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Let it not always

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
be a part of his duties.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
The next group

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
is decision-making

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
by mathematical modeling.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
There is a whole

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
arsenal of tools

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
that allows

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
to write all the data,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
to find mathematical models,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
to include triple,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
integral, double,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
integral matrices,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
to make a powerful

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
statistical processing

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
and to prepare

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
some initial data

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
for decision-making

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
by a willpower

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
or just

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
give a ready-made decision.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
For example,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
you can calculate

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
the performance

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
of a branch of a company

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
by a mathematical program.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You can calculate

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
the market demand

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
and market saturation.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You can do it with a different range,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
with a market segment orientation,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
with a group of consumers.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
You can write

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and talk about these methods

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and how to make a comparison,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
how to make predictions.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It is all in textbooks.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Let's move to another group

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
of methods of decision-making

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
and decision-making.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Here, as a rule,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
creative decisions,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
we have already talked about it,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
require a high level of qualification

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
of the decision-making person

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
or a group of decision-making persons.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
They are divided into several groups.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
This is a large group.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
They are required

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
in situations

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
when there is a lot of uncertainty

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
and a high risk.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
When the situation

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
is undetermined,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
mathematically indescribable,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
but a decision is required.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
This is a strategy for the development

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
of something.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
This is a decision

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
like the one we had

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
with the trolleybus.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Here,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
of course,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
from the decision-making person,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
from the collegial decision-making person,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
high creative abilities are required,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
or creativity,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
creativity.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Nevertheless,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
even without high creative people,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
these methods can work,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
especially if we organize

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
a group method,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
use group methods

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
of decision-making.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
After all, creative decisions

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
can be made individually.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
There are appropriate exercises

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
that allow a person to learn

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
how to make these decisions.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
But it is much easier

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to make a collective decision

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
with the help of appropriate methods.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Why is it more profitable?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
How profitable is it?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
How did the researchers calculate

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
the efficiency

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
of the number of developed

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
solutions at the second stage,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
at the third stage,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
when the ideas and options

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
of solving the problem are generated?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
If a group works,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
then the number of proposals

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
is 70% higher

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
than if we sum up

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
the proposals of each member

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
of this group

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
when they work separately.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That is, if 7 people worked

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
on 10 solutions separately,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
we got 70,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
then these same 7 people

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
working in a group

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
produce more than 100 solutions,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
more than 100 proposals.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
This is the efficiency.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
It is clear that a person

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
who can organize

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
a group work

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
to use creative methods

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
of decision-making

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
wins a lot

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
compared to those

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
who cannot organize a group work.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Maybe this is the strength

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
of the Eastern model of governance,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
that they work in a group.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
The creative methods

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
of group decision-making

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
include brainstorming,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
meetings, seminars,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
expert assessment

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and business play.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Let's briefly touch on brainstorming.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
What is it?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Brainstorming is usually

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
dedicated to solving a problem.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Three groups of participants are formed.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
The first group is called

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
idea generators,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
who can be both specialists

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
and non-specialists.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Of course,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
we want to have people

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
with high creative abilities

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
in this group,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
or at least able to

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
generate ideas.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
This group usually includes

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
7-12 people,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
which is enough.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
The second group is

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
so-called system operators,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
who try to determine

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
how feasible

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
a decision is.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
On the one hand,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and on the other hand,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
how new it is.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So, it is known, new,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and feasible-unfeasible.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
The third group is analysts,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
who try to analyze

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
and assess resource costs

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
from the decisions

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
that come out

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
as feasible

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
from the second group,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
and the third group

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
is analysts,

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
who try to

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
determine

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
how feasible

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
a decision is.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
So,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
how does the first group work?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
It is the most important.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
The second and third groups

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
are more or less clear.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
The first group

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
works as follows.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
First,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
they are offered a cup of coffee,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
listening to some background music,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
and someone tells them

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
about a problem.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
They don't really get into it,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
they listen to it,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and then

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
they are offered

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
to make some suggestions

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
on how to solve

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
this problem.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
At the stage of intelligence,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
the persuasive request

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
to all participants

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
is to talk about their own.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Everyone can either

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
write down their suggestions,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
then voice them,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
and as they do so,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
they can write down

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
their new ideas,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
which were born associatively.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Or

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
they can make their suggestions

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
right away.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
It's not about that.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
It's about 5-10 minutes

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
of lazy talking,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
of some kind of baggage,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
of some kind of idea.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
After that,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
a short pause is made,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and participants

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
sit down again

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
to listen to

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
the same light,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
but different,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
encouraging music.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
They start discussing

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
these ideas without criticism,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
only highlighting the strongest ideas,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
without criticizing.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
This process is repeated at all stages

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
of ideas generation.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Their task is to develop new ideas

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
based on those ideas.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It's a work on association.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And here,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
at this stage,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
a qualitative leap occurs

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
in the number of ideas

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and suggestions

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
that outperform

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
the work of individuals.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Right here.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
This stage lasts

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
until a group is exhausted.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
If it's 7 minutes,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
the group starts to exhale,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
trying to warm it up.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
But within 15-20 minutes,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
the group usually exhales

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
and stops generating ideas.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
At this stage,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
the group's work stops.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
The group is thanked

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
for its creative participation

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
in solving the problem.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Moreover, even non-professionals

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
can generate ideas

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and pass them on to other groups.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And this is where

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
the work begins.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
An example of this

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
use of brainstorming

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
can be an interesting operation.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
An interesting situation.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
We know that there was

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
the Great Patriotic War

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
during the World War.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Germany, for the first time

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
in the history of mankind,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
invented

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
underwater torpedoes

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
that were launched

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
from the bottom of the class

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
by the water.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
They were launched by the water,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
and reached the target.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
They were designed

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
primarily for the enemy's submarines.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Germany destroyed

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
the British fleet first.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
The torpedo was launched.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
It was discovered very late,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
when the submarine,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
having a lot of weight,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
had to be protected.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
The British Navy

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
gathered officers,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
including non-professionals,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
and started thinking

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
what to do.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
They generated ideas.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
When the ideas

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
at the stage of mass generation

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
were coming to an end,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
they decided to speed up the situation.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
They said,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
you officers are waiting

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
on the bridge,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
and you are 5 meters away

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
from the submarine.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
What to do?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
The officers and the submarines

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
wanted to live.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
One of them said,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I don't care about your tasks.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
The neighbor said,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I don't care.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
We will launch a single shot

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
at the enemy's torpedo.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
The water splashes out,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
the torpedo is thrown up,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
the direction changes,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and the torpedo passes

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
above the submarine.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Or below.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
The direction of movement changes.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
That's it. The solution was found.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
It was a simple and effective solution,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
although it was difficult

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
to come up with something.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I would like to say

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
that after listening to this course,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
and looking at the electronic textbook,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
we have some skills left,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
some tools to solve problems.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And since any person

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
who starts his career

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
as a first-line manager

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
strives to reach the top,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
we will look at what is useful

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
at all levels.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
And now let's look

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
at the important points

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
in organizing a brainstorming,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
which help to organize it

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
in your company.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
First of all,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
there are many questions,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
including,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
it seems,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
that it is necessary to have

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
some qualities to lead

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
a brainstorming.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
No, no such qualities

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
are required.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
You just need to know how to use technology.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
When we come to the doctor

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
to treat a tooth,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
we demand leadership qualities from him.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
No, he can drill, find,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
put a seal,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and nothing else is required.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
So, when organizing a brainstorming,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
no special qualities are required.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
You just need to know how to select

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
a group of idea generators,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
which will perform two stages,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
scouting generation

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and cascade idea generation.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
That's all.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
You just need to know how to select

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
people with creative abilities.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
How do they select?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
They are selected by tests.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
There is a simple test

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
for the dominant type of thinking,

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
that is, for right-left half-circle.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Faces with a pronounced

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
right-left half-circle

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
are the dominant type of thinking.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Logicians, those who work

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
more with a left-half-circle,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
are better not to invite

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
to the group of idea generators.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
What is required?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
After setting the task,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
you need to ensure

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
one simple rule

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
that no ideas are criticized.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
All ideas are announced

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
and new ideas

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
should arise

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
in the group of idea generators.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
It is not necessary

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
to fix a specific idea.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Each idea is fixed

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and recorded on a piece of paper.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
The paper is handed over

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
to the group number 2

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
after both stages of idea generation.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
All ideas,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
110, 112, 170,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
are handed over to the group number 2.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
That's all.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
We do not criticize anyone.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
We encourage new statements.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
New ideas.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
In the first group,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
ideas are not criticized,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
but any, even the most fantastic ideas

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
are encouraged.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
They are welcomed.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
As many as you want.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Any most unrealistic ideas,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
even to do something

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
with a phantom reflector or a disintegrator.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
There are no disintegrators yet.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
They are handed over to the group number 2.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
After that,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
they work there.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
In the first part,

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
the ideas are not signed

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
by the author.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
They are considered

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
a product of the collegial generation.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
The group,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
which produced

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
the ideas one by one,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
without the authorship of the ideas,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
is sent to the next group.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
There they are divided

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
into three baskets.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
We usually have a ballot box.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Or we call them differently.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
In one basket,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
unrealizable ideas are put together.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Out of these 170 proposals,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
a whole bunch of them.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
In the other basket,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
realizable ideas are put together.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And in the third basket,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
potentially realizable ideas.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Ideas that can be realized

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
when resources or technology

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
are used.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
For example,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
the press has reported

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
that Siemens

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
has made

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
a folding display

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
with a size

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
of a notebook.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Unfortunately,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the developers

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
can see

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
four shades of gray on it.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
They want to make it colorful.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
What are these displays for?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
They should be connected

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to mobile phones.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
We have a phone with an Internet output,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
small calculators, processors.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
They make the keyboard

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
to the mobile phone.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
To get rid of computers in life,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
not to carry laptops,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
not to have computers at home.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Computers are considered

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
as a dying generation of technology.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
We need screens.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We take a pocket screen,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
edit the text,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
send it to someone

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
or connect

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
a printing device

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and print the text.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
The decision,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the principal decision,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
is to make such

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
folding displays.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
The technical decision

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
does not allow

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
mass production.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The decision about the creation

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
of such a display

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
is put in a folder

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
with potential solutions.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
The solutions that are not realized

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
are excluded from the review.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The third group

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
is given

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the solutions that are realized

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
today.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The group of analysts

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
considers

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
how these solutions

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
should be provided,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
calculates them,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
to develop the basic options,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
including the use of mathematical methods

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
to further

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
implement this decision.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Potentially, the implementation of the solution

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
is also considered by other groups,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
since they are not relevant

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
at the moment.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
These are the possible options

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
of the management decision,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
which are not urgent.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I hope it is clear now

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
that the company does not invite

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
specialists of game engineering,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
who can easily organize

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
such interesting events.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The whole brainstorming

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
takes 1-2 hours

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
of astronomical time.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
The next very interesting method

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
that is in the group

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
of creative methods

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
of decision-making

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
is a meeting.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It is easy and difficult at the same time.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Why is it easy?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Because every day,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
every week, our managers

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
hold some meetings.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The difficulty is that we are used to them

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and we make a lot of mistakes

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
that

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
sharply reduce the efficiency

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
of management activity.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Mistakes in holding meetings.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I had to configure the meeting system

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
in one Russian company

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
of the pro-Western type.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
First, I held the meeting

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
myself,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
working as a head of the internal training service.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Secondly,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
since I already had experience

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
in holding meetings,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I knew the technology,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
studied it on purpose.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Having launched the meeting technology

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
for the people who participated in it,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
who held the meeting themselves,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I was very surprised.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
How surprised?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
First of all,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
since almost everyone has experience

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
in holding meetings

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
or participation in them,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
we will decide what roles there are in the meeting.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
After that, we will try to remove

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
the shortcomings that are visible today

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
or try to make them a virtue.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So, when holding a meeting,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
first of all,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
there is

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the role of the chairman,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
the person who leads.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It does not necessarily mean

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
the head of the unit or the whole organization.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It can be another person

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
whom he trusts or entrusts to conduct it.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
There is an organizer of the meeting,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
the person who notifies

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the participants,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
sends them information.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
There is a reporter

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
or co-reporters who speak

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
with the reporter or co-reporters

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
on the previously outlined problems.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And there are participants

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
who listen to the reports

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and make decisions.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Moreover,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
it is desirable to have a group of people

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
at the meeting

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
a little later,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
who are on the so-called

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
short leash.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
A person sits at his workplace

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and does his official duties,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
but he knows that at such a time

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
he can be invited to a meeting

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
on such a question.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
For example, someone in the personnel department

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
of the sales organization

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
conducts a meeting on the market capture.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
He knows that he can be invited

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
on such a question,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
he can do without it.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
He does not go anywhere,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
he does his own business.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
He does not go to other meetings,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
does not go to another organization,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
does not meet potential future employees.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
He works with papers,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
he is not distracted by anything.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Now the question is,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
what is the purpose of the meeting?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
At the meetings,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
operational issues are solved,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
which require a creative approach,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
a creative solution.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And here there is an interesting rule,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
developed over the years abroad,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
that meetings are held

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
only when it is impossible

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
to do without them.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Here we have,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
as a rule,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
especially in administrative structures,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
the so-called meeting of the next plan.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
The head of some units

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
is asked to tell them

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
what they need to do

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
in such an instructive and

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
directive manner.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
He asks for reports on what they have done

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and sets new tasks.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
We even have a video

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
about such meetings

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
in Russia.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The question is,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
what are these meetings

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
for?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Let's take an example.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
The governor of the Krasnodar Territory,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Nikolai Ignatievich Kondratenko,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
used to like to hold

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
planning meetings.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I know how they were held there.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
All heads of local municipalities

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
would meet on Mondays

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
at 10 or 11 o'clock

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
in the Krasnodar Territory administration.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Someone would drive

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
250-300 km,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and they would come.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
They would spend

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
3-4 hours on the road.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And the governor

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
would set tasks for them,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
ask for reports.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
All heads of local municipalities

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
would sit with them

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and listen to their tasks,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
their indicators,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
what they had done in the past month,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
what they needed to do, etc.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I have a question.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
What prevented them

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
from sending these tasks

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
on the Internet?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
People would sit for 3-4 hours

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and listen to their ideas.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They did not generate their ideas,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
did not make any proposals.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Why did they go?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
After the meeting,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
they would solve their own questions

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
with deputies,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
with heads of local municipalities,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and then go back.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
They would spend 3-4 hours on the road.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
They would lose their working day.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Why?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It's easy and simple.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
The meeting is held

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
when it is necessary to find solutions

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
and when it is impossible to do without people's contact.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
There is a so-called

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
in-person meeting,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
when information is sent.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The same report is prepared

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
by the reporters.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The report is prepared by the reporters.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
The internal mail is also sent

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
to those people who are interested

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
in solving the issue.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
They study it, write their conclusions,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
their proposals, and send it back

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
to the organizer of the in-person meeting.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Not to the organization's leader,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
not to his deputy,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
but to the person

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
who is preparing the issue.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The person prepares the issue,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
gets acquainted with the proposals,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and if it is possible to do without

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
the gathering of people,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
without their absence,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
then the decision is made

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
in person by the person

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
who makes the decision,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
by the person who is responsible for it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Why is it suggested

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
to refuse

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
the gathering of people

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and the in-person meetings?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
In the end,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
meetings are considered

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
the most expensive

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
type of management activity in the world.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Why?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
When I held a meeting

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
in this pro-Western organization,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I sent out a schedule

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and a note at the bottom

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
that one minute of our meeting

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
costs the same amount

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
as the organization.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Because everyone has their own

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
budget for the meeting.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
The leaders usually have high budgets

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
with bonuses.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So, every hour of work

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
can be estimated in rubles,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and every minute, respectively.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Accordingly,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
the meeting schedule,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
which is recommended

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
all over the world,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
was that

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
the time for the speaker's speech

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
is 2-3 minutes,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
because if the report is already sent out,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
it is easy to go through

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
the pain points.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And the time for the speech

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
in the discussions,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
the time for the participants' statements

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
is exactly one minute.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Can you imagine

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
the shock

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
that the organizer of the meeting

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
asked for?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
One minute for a speech?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
How come?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
We are not used to talking like this,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and when the participants

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
of the meeting gathered,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I explained to him

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
why such a strict requirement.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Generally,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
the normal speech pace

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
of a person

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
who is perceived by the listener

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
is 2 words per second.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
In 60 minutes,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
one can say 120 words.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
If the length of one sentence

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
is 4-5-6 words,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
then, accordingly,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
one can say 20 sentences

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
in one minute.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I have a question.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
If a meeting is held

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
about a problem

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
that could not be solved,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and suddenly

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
a participant of the meeting

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
has 20 sentences to solve,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
why is it still not solved?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
The conversation about nothing

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
during the meeting

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
is expensive for the organization.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
The request was to express

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
a proposal to solve the problem.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I propose to solve the problem

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
in this way,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
with the help of such resources.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
This is my request,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
my proposal,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
my limitation on the length

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
of the meeting.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It turns out to be practical

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
in the eastern management model.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The speaker is allowed to speak

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
for one minute.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
After one minute,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
the microphone is turned off.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
This is normal.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
This is the custom in the country

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
of the rising sun.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
If he continues to speak

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
without a microphone,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
he simply goes down

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
to the floor with the audience.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Technically,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
it is impossible to speak

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
for more than two minutes.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
This is the custom of the high management culture

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
in the east.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Now the total length

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
of the meeting,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
if we hold it from start to finish,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
should be no more than 45 minutes.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
In 45 minutes,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
we need to consider

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
the issues on the agenda,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
find the proposed solutions,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
and pass them on to the specialists

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
so that they can find

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
and justify the resource provision.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
The meetings of 2,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
3, or 4 hours are of no importance

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
because a person gets tired

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
after 45 minutes,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and he needs a break.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Let's look at schools.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
The educational system

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
works for 45 minutes worldwide.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Why? Because a person needs a break.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The head gets tired of thinking.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Is it clear?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Considering these points,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
the speech is within one minute,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
the report is within 2-3 minutes,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and the length of the meeting is 45 minutes.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
The meeting is held only

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
when it is impossible to do without it.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
How many time resources

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
will it allow to set up

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
an organization in any company

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that will take into account

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
the 4 simple rules

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
when holding a meeting?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
How much more

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
will the employees do their business

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
instead of attending meetings

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and often imitating

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
their business activity

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
at this meeting?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They may write down a note,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
try to raise their hand,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
throw in a few lines,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
or talk for a long time.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The next way

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
to organize a group work

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
is a seminar.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It is not only

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
a seminar,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
but also a way

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
to solve a production problem.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
A seminar is not

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
a way to solve

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
a production problem.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Unlike meetings,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
it is held much less often

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
and is about

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
non-urgent problems

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
that are more strategic

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
than meetings.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Therefore,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
the seminar preparation time

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
is 1.5-2 weeks,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
whereas a meeting

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
is 1.5-2 months.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
There are also chairpersons,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
reporters,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
and listeners

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
who are interested in solving

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
this problem,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
as well as seminar organizers.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The seminar is different.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
A report is made

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
more often

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
because the problem is more serious.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
However,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I think that if people

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
are interested in solving a problem,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
they should listen to it.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
If there is something to talk about

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
for 15 minutes,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
then it is possible.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
This is my recommendation.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
This is the seminar's approach.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Unlike meetings,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
the chairperson is recommended

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
to organize

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
a round of statements

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
from participants

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
so that everyone

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
can speak out

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
on the problem

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and its solution.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
First,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
after listening to the painful points,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
then after listening

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
to the painful points,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
and then after listening

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
to the painful points,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
so that the person can prepare

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
in advance for the solution.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Third,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
his statement should allow

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
someone to initiate

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
some thoughts.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
What is also common

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
in seminars and meetings

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
is that both

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
are recommended

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
to let participants

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
stand up

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and walk around

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
for 45 minutes.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Of course, they should not step on the floor

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
or knock on the door.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
The room should be cool and cozy

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
with mineral water on the tables.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
If participants of the seminar

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
are not familiar with each other,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
let alone a large company

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
with 10,000 people in the state,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
each participant should have

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
a sign with his name and position

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
so that they can address each other

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That's all.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I think it is clear

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
how to reduce the time

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
to hold a meeting

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and increase their effectiveness.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Next,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
another way

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
of organizing

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
a group work

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
when adopting

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
creative methods

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
for governance decisions

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
is an expert assessment.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
How is it done?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Usually,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
10-15 experts

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
are enough

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
to solve a problem.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They may not know each other,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
but they are in different organizations.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It is not necessary

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
to be in your own organization.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
They are given a description

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
or a report

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
of the same person

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
who took part in the meeting

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
or was supposed to attend the seminar

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
but decided to refuse.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
The problem is that

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the experts may be paid,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
free, public, etc.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Each of them is assessed

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
by a certain parameter

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
as an expert.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
There are tables and developed methods

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
to assess the importance

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
of an expert and his decision.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
They work.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Mathematicians believe

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that it is necessary

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
to have a decision

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
that is mathematically and statistically

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
correct.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
There are more than 100 experts.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It is hard to achieve this

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
in production.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It is hard to solve

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
tactical problems.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It may not make sense.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
In any case,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
all business processes

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and organization development

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
are always a process

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
associated with risk

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and a system

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
with a large probability

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
of uncertainty.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
There may be changes.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
The number of experts

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
is not a goal.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
They may read a decision

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and it may be changed

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
or not even take place.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
We will talk about

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
the necessary decisions

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
later.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Our goal

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
is to learn

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
to make the right decisions.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Experts work.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They develop

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
their own criteria

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and recommendations

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
on solving problems.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
They submit them to an organizer.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The working group

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
and the organizer

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
look at the proposals

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
based on the rating

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and importance

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
of the experts.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
They also

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
provide resources.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
The most important

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and realistic decisions

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
are made by the organizer.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
There is another

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
interesting way

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
of organizing a group

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
of people

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
who make decisions

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
called a business game.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
What is its advantage?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It has a huge advantage

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
compared to other methods.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Why?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
It not only allows

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
to find solutions,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
but also to develop

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
the organization.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
First of all,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
it is a training of management skills.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It is a promotion of

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
the participants' skills.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
They learn new approaches

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and develop their cooperation.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
They develop their skills

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
to solve similar problems.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
They are used to generating

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
new ideas.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
In a business game,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
the group is more active.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
The American model

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
of individualistic work

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
in the USA

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
is based on

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
the training of the team.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The American team

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
is trained

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
to work as a team.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Why?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Because the Americans

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
have been learning to work

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
individually for two and a half

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
hundred years.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Group decisions are more

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
important.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
A business game

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
allows to solve a task

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and strengthen a team.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
A manager is not a manager

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
until he has a team.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
What are business games?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
They are different.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
A business game has two plans.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
The first one is

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
solving a problem.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
The second one is

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
training of certain actions.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
The second plan is not

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
a business game.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Only experienced players

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and coaches know

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
that there is a plan.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
They try to solve it

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
to the maximum.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Usually, the task is solved,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
but the second plan

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
works regardless

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
of the organizers' qualifications.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Business games can be

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
imitation, management,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
and so on.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I have more than

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
100 games

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
where we make decisions,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
learn management skills,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
learn theoretical questions

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
in management,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
such as conflictology,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
organizational structures,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
and at the same time

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
solve team formation,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
leadership qualities,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
creative abilities,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
and stress-resistance.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
These are the advantages

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
of business games.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The task is set,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
the participants are informed

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
about the task,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
and the game scenario is developed.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I can't tell you about the scenarios

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
because every game

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
has its own scenario.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
For example, we know

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
the game of the shipwrecked.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It is a well-known scenario

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
where you can lose a lot of situations

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
and find solutions.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
In business games,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
the task is

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
to make a smooth

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
and gradual decision.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The strongest decisions

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
are the ones

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
approved by the majority

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
of the team.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
In business games,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
unlike seminars

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and expert assessments,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
the task is

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
to make a smooth

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and gradual decision.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
The task is to make a smooth

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and gradual decision.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Unlike seminars and expert assessments,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
meetings and brainstorming

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
allow to bring

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
the entire team

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
to the solution of the problem.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You can organize

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
the game scenario

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
on the lower levels

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
where each specialist

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and team member

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
make a general decision

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and then the decision

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
is transferred to another level

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
of the first line managers.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
The decision is processed

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
in the same way

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
as the first line managers

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
process the ideas

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
that were proposed

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
from the specialists' level.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
The decisions are processed,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
the approaches are developed,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
they are strengthened

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and transferred to the middle level.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
The middle level is again

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
divided into 2-3 groups

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and each group makes improvements

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
and strengthens the decisions

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
so that each member of the team

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and each organization

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
becomes involved

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
in the decision

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
that is made

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
at the top level.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
The first line managers

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and specialists

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
are involved in the business game

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and in the game form.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
What is the advantage of the game form?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
People do not offend each other.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
They play.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
If someone outplayed someone,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
it is a game.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Why should you be offended

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
if he is stronger?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
We do not really get offended

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
when we play volleyball

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
team against team.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Unlike meetings,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
if a decision has been made,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
an alternative figure

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and decision-maker

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
can be offended.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I proposed a decision

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
that is better than that.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
My decision is always better

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
than that decision.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It is a shame on the management

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
and on the person who came up with the decision.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
In the game,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
it is difficult to offend

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
your colleagues

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
because the decisions are collegial.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Secondly, they are getting stronger

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and stronger.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Even if someone's decision

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
did not pass,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
it is a game.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It is a psychological atmosphere

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
of trust and comfort.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
It is better to make decisions

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
through business games

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
than through meetings and seminars.
