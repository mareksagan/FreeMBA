WEBVTT

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.100
My name is Vladislav Tolkach, and

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.560
we will talk to you about management

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.920
accounting.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.060
A few words about myself.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.860
The main place of my work is the Controlling

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.300
Academy, a joint project of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.320
the controller of the AG Academy

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.660
of Munich and the German School

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.840
of Business.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
We have contact with Peter

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.460
Krovat, a well-known figure

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.380
in Germany who is also engaged

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.140
in controlling.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.660
We have translated two of his books

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.800
into Russian, “Concept of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.900
Controlling” and “Implementation

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.520
of a Balanced System of Indicators”.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240
The structure of our course on this slide.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.920
First, we will talk about the location

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.360
of management accounting in the control

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.820
system, then compare the three

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.120
accounts that, as a rule, the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.900
company has.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.400
This is the tax that companies

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.740
conduct to provide information

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820
to government agencies.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.120
These are the financial ones that companies

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.800
run to provide information to the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.120
capital market, banks, exchanges and so on.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820
And we'll talk about the management

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.880
accounting that companies keep for themselves

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.960
to understand what's really

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.860
happening in the business.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.680
The next point of our course is key

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
performance indicators, so-called KPIs,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.220
key performance indicators,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.360
that is, these are the bulbs

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.940
that usually light on the plane

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.740
or manager if you compare the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.560
manager to the pilot of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.940
the aircraft.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
Furthermore, management reports

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.460
are reports that we receive in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920
addition to indicators to understand

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.460
what is happening in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.420
the business.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880
In tax and financial accounting, external

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.400
users are interested in the outcome

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.980
of the business as a whole, but in management

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.320
accounting we are interested in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.580
the efficiency of the work of not only

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580
the company as a whole, but

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.080
also individual structural units.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.960
In the next paragraph we talk about the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.620
financial structure, about the centers

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.960
of financial responsibility.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.620
It is the structural unit of the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.460
company responsible for one or another

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.640
part of the profit and loss report.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.760
There are structural units that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.380
are solely responsible for costs.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.920
But since some structural

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.380
units, in addition to costs, also

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.320
generate income, structural units

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.020
are either designated as centers

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.440
of gross income or as centers

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.380
of profit.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.040
In addition, within this point, a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.340
very interesting topic is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.000
domestic prices, or so-called

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.240
transfer prices.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.060
This is the price at which

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.760
a product or service within

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.360
the company moves from one division

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.800
to another.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.960
The next item of the program is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480
the accounting policy of management

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.280
accounting, that is, these are

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.920
the rules, principles, canons

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.020
that we must observe within

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.660
the company, verified by internal

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.260
audit, so that the figures

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.500
we can trust are obtained in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.260
the reports.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760
The last item of the program

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.040
is the plan of management accounts.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.400
The last point of the program

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.020
is some organizational aspects.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.100
As part of this paragraph,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.980
we will talk about how to organize

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.420
management accounting in the company,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.720
who it is most concerned, who

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.640
in the smaller, how different

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.440
structural units are

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.620
involved in this process and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.220
can how it eventually connects

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.280
with each other and how it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080
ends up being used blindly

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.060
on the table.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.470
Management accounting as a system

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.510
is part of an integrated

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.370
concept called controlling

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.030
in Germany.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.110
And what it is, I will try

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.210
to explain to you by an example

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.190
of how two people, husband

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.510
and wife, go on holiday.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.790
Imagine that before going on vacation,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.250
a husband asks his wife, dear,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.750
what goals we set before us

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.170
when going on vacation.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.990
My wife says to rest.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.970
And the husband, more skilled in the field

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.450
of control, says the wife, the goal

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.410
is not formulated quite

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.810
correctly, the goal should

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.450
be measurable.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.890
So, the goal is

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.790
to rest at 100%.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.620
So the goal of these two people

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.380
who go on vacation is to rest at

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.660
100%, and this is the scale by which

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.560
they will monitor the degree of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.660
rest during the vacation

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.940
– 25%, 50%, 75% of the degree So, control

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.560
starts with the setting of a goal,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.200
with the development of some

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.920
measurable goals, and the second

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.640
stage – is the allocation of the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.280
budget, the allocation of those

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.880
resources that are necessary

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.900
for us to the goals.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.260
So, the husband asks his

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.160
wife, somehow you think how much

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.960
money we will need to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.200
rest at 100%.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.500
My wife says, I think that

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.600
3500 euros for two is more or

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.220
less real.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.100
The husband agrees they write this amount

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.780
of 3500 euros for two and for now it

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.040
is only a prediction of how much

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.920
not in the holiday will spend but to

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.040
turn it into a budget the husband takes

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.800
a needle and pierces his wife's finger

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.180
with a needle, so the signed

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.420
blood forecast turns into

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.300
a budget of 3500 euros for two and

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.400
the goal is to rest at 100%.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.720
After that, management accounting

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.880
begins, that is, the collection

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.560
of information on the fact.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.180
Information is collected in fact

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.220
during the control cuts.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.220
The husband makes the first check-

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.460
in cut after 3 days of vacation.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.560
He makes the first check-in

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.090
and asks his wife how restful

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.710
you are at the moment.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.990
My wife says that the feelings

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.650
are strange enough, only 3 days

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.230
in vacation, and already 80

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.690
percent, I feel rested.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.350
And my husband says, you know,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.870
I have the same feelings,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.710
I also feel 80 percent rested.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.750
We can draw a line like this,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.730
this is how the resting curve behaves.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.390
By the end of the third day, the rate

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.870
of achieving the goal is 80%.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.810
The husband has a laptop, flash drive,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.070
exel with him on vacation, and he

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.050
records exactly the amount spent,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.810
how much they spent on restaurants,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.290
how much they spent on

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.330
some other items.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.010
And by the end of the third

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.750
day the amount is not very

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.750
large - 200 euros.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.380
I remember what was initially discussed in the

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.980
figure of 3,500 euros for the entire period

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.540
and the goal is to rest at 100%.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.140
My husband has an interesting idea.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.720
He recalls the “20 to 80” principle

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.040
and says, “Woman, what's the point?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.420
We have to spend another week and a

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.800
half and spend 3,300 euros if we have

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.360
already achieved the 80% of the goal we wanted.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.300
Go home to home.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.280
My wife says we wanted to rest

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.020
at 100%, so I think we should

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.580
stay and push out the

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.440
remaining 20%.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.060
The husband agrees, and the

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.640
second check cut he makes at the end

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.920
of the first week, continuing

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.000
to accumulate actual information,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.040
that is, essentially engaging

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.640
in management By the end of the

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.240
first week the actual rest rate

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.620
of both holidaymakers is,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.220
say, 85%, it continued to

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.320
grow and was 85% by the end

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.540
of the first week.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.020
We look into a document called “Accounting

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.420
for the Execution of the Budget”

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.820
and in this document we find

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.840
a number that is quite large,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.880
it is 3 thousand euros already.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.800
By the end of the first week, 3 thousand

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.680
euros were spent out of a total of 3 500.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.640
The husband again offers to go

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.840
home, because a very even

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.260
good result, 85%, already

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.140
spent a lot of money.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.460
In his view, it makes no

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.500
sense to be on vacation for another

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.040
whole week, for the remaining

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.100
15% to rest, that is, it spends

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.920
3,500.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.780
My wife says no, we wanted

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.280
to rest at 100%, so I

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.220
suggest staying.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.760
But, objectively evaluating the situation,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.280
I see that we cannot afford the

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.080
remaining 15% for the remaining 500 euros.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.820
When we planned with you,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.020
we didn't know that in England,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.540
they went on vacation, such

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.840
expensive football tickets, such

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.420
expensive restaurants and all

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.400
museums paid.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.520
We assumed that this was expensive,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.500
but thank God my husband had

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.900
a reserve fund with him, and

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.120
the newly adjusted

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.340
newly approved budget value

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.060
looks like this.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:54.740
Let's say 4 thousand euros, not in addition

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.340
to that sum of 3,500, but only 4

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.120
thousand, that is, 500 he added

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.000
from the reserve fund.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.720
The third check-up took place three

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.700
days later.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.240
The rest rate is 92%,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.500
the actual amount

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.900
spent at this time,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:26.600
say, 3550 euros.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.800
The husband has not asked for home, he

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.400
decided that we will be to the end,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.600
we will strive for the 100% achievement

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.960
of the goals, and we will not re-

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.260
examine the budget again.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.460
And the last fourth job

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.280
is done by these two people

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.640
after they return home.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.100
This is the last fourth

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.120
check.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.340
It turns out that the degree of rest

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.420
when they are the actual

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:10.400
amount spent was 3830 euros.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.740
In fact, the money spent is

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.980
the actual degree of rest.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.880
We aimed at 100%, the original

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.920
budget was 3500 euros, the

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.800
adjusted budget was

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.680
4 thousand euros, but in fact

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.300
we spent 3830, controlling

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.380
as a function suggests

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.480
that we compare the actual

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.080
degree of achievement with

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.780
the plan and discuss why

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.540
we still failed to rest 100%.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.480
98,5 percent is a good result, but

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.100
still not 100%.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.000
And the second thing we compare is the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.180
money actually spent with the plan,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.400
with the budget.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.820
We had two budgets, we discussed

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.400
the deviations from that amount, from

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.600
the first one that was signed with

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.520
blood, when we did not know that

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.180
restaurants were so expensive in England.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.900
We must compare this with the

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.560
second value, with the adjusted

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.940
budget value too, in order to discuss

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.300
the deviations.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.380
The combination of these four actions

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.300
- targeting, budgeting, control cuts,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.140
gathering information on the

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.640
fact and identifying flights

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.500
at the end, the fourth action,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.940
In the German and German

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.380
business environments, the Anglo-

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.680
Saxon term is usually called control.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.840
Management accounting is part of

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.780
the control system.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.760
We've seen that this is the part where

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.620
we actually collect information about

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.280
the actual degree of achievement

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.040
of goals and how the budget is executed.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.460
Within the framework of this program

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.420
we will not talk about targeting, we

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.180
will not talk about budgeting, we

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.620
will not talk about the selection

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.300
of flights, but we will talk about

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.860
management accounting, about how the

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.320
company collects financial

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.360
and economic information about

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.420
the achieved results in

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.020
the range of structural units.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.500
Ideally, if there is a control in

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.020
the company, then at 3 a.m. the

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.300
waking chief logistics officer

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.740
reads the poem by the mouth.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.600
The first part of the poem is the

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.960
main logistics officer in knowledge of

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.540
what the goals of the business in which he

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.780
works, the business in general, where the

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.080
business moves, what will be with

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.160
the business about a year in three.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.280
The second part of the silence is

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.560
information about what the logistics

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.540
department's goals are headed

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.840
by the head.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.260
The objectives of the business as a whole

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.940
and the objectives of the structural unit.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.380
and further.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.440
Ideally, the chief logistics officer

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.760
lives in a budget signed with

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.820
blood, and the company has such

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.240
a small evil creature that makes

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.540
not very pleasant for the chief

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.700
logistics visits, performing

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.120
control cuts that can be

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.260
planned or not planned.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.340
By making these check-ins, this

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.460
little evil creature asks

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.840
what you have at the moment, on

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.300
the 27th, with achieving goals

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.140
and with budget execution.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.280
What you are going to do in the

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.920
days left until the end of the month

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.020
or quarter, so that you still aim

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.440
to give out those that we agreed with

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.600
you before the beginning of this

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.020
period in the budget to fit.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.680
You know there are two bad situations.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.740
One very bad, one very good.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.240
The structural unit issued on the

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.580
Garate objectives that indications

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.820
were agreed but did not fit

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.000
into the budget.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.840
The budget and structural

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.380
unit fit, but the goal was

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.100
not achieved.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.280
Very bad situation - the goals of

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.780
the uninsured budget did not fit.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.980
But the best we strive for

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.020
is to implement controlling,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.520
so that the structural business

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.180
units the goals that were

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.600
agreed with them

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.300
and fit in the budget.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.380
This is an ideal situation.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.200
So, we'll talk about accumulating

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.240
actual information and

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.060
what management accounting

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.800
differs from the two others

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.060
that a company can

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.720
be.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.660
From the tax accounting that we

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.200
carry out to serve the desired

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.300
state, and from the financial

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.840
accounting that we can do to look

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.540
for cheap money in banks

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.800
or on exchanges, that is, in

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.900
the capital market.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.520
I usually draw management accounting

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.660
in the form of a triangle that

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.960
has some foundation and a top.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.440
Why this figure?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.020
Because when information in

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.320
the company is accumulated,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.660
processed, generalized,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.200
aggregated, then at the output

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.080
at the top we have about this

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.060
small sheet of paper with

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.800
three, four, maybe five key

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.740
indicators, by which we monitor

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.720
our business.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.440
On the tip of this triangle,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.980
you can place this paper

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.860
with four key indicators.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.020
We can get much more detailed and

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.260
additional details from here

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.760
from the triangle, deepening

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.820
down there, but in the

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.360
large part we have everything that

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.560
happens in the company,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.460
should be reduced to 3-4 target

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.200
values, by which we can make

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.580
our business a preliminary

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.640
diagnosis.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.980
We can make the final diagnosis

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.480
by looking at a wider list of indicators,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.520
but the primary, approximate

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.840
diagnosis can be made by looking

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.560
at 3-4 key indicators, which

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.160
is an iceberg that floats

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:43.900
in the ocean, and, as far as

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.680
I know, only 9% of the

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.980
iceberg is above water and

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.880
91% under water.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.920
Financial indicators usually pop

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.980
up to the surface.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.640
This is profit, revenue,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.020
cash flow, profitability on

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.480
invested capital, value.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.100
And that's usually what brings the

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.920
manager to the table.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.940
But this is only the surface of the

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.840
iceberg, and it is not always

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.460
the manager who understands why

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.080
such a good or such a bad profit,

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.360
why such a good or such a

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.860
bad value of the profitability

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.180
of the imposed capital have brought

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.360
us to understand this duck

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.440
that floats on the surface.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.180
That is, it is a colleague

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.760
who collects this information

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
in the company for the manager,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.500
should dive underwater and see

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.280
what is happening here, and

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.260
maybe even deepen below, yes,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.440
pick up the so-called non-

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.380
value, not financial indicators.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.340
This can be the marriage share,

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.220
it can be the average time

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.600
of order execution, it can be the customer'

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.340
s double-value index, it can

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.560
be the flow of personnel.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.220
In general, all this in one

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.660
or another degree contributes

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.900
to the fact that we have a good

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.920
or not good profit, a large

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.860
or small cash flow, a good

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.200
or low profitability

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.800
on the invested capital.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.080
Not financial data,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.900
not financial data.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.440
This is usually the part underwater,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.040
but it is very important because we

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.760
need to understand the mechanism

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.220
of forming financial quantities,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.060
and accordingly the duck should

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.420
periodically dive and watch what

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440
is happening there.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.720
So, management accounting we draw

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720
in the form of a triangle, but it

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.380
is important to understand that

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.320
in each company there are at least

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.180
two triangles, in which financial

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.800
and economic

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.840
information can accumulate.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.440
One triangle is the triangle

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.880
that we build to serve the

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.920
needs of the state, and

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.680
it is called tax accounting,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.920
or tax accounting in

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.700
English.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.240
And the second is the

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.580
most managerial one that we lead

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.560
for ourselves, in order to understand

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.620
what is actually happening in

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.260
our company.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.820
These two triangles, as you can

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.440
see in this slide, have some area

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.540
of intersection.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.580
It can be greater

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.880
or less.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.420
It is clear only that there

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.540
is always a crossroads area,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.320
at least the company's management

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.600
is interested in what we

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.000
paid state taxes, what fines

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.000
and how the money moved

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.360
on the bill and on the cash.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.680
This is the minimum we will

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.320
take from the tax account.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.720
On this diagram you see that

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.120
triangles have a fairly large

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.240
area of intersection, which means

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.580
that enough of the information

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.820
hanging in the accounting, in the

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.160
tax accounting, falls into the

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.560
management accounting triangle.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.760
It is a black area below,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.040
the foundation of triangles.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.160
However, the company has a blue

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.600
area, these are those objects,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.320
information about which is only

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320
by the internal user

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.400
and does not fall into the so-

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.100
called tax accounting, which

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.320
we send to the state.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.260
But these are not necessarily the notorious

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.400
grey things, they can be so-called

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.920
implicit costs that we count

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.040
in management accounting

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.640
and that we do not count, sending

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.700
something with whites and

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.040
losses to the state.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.160
For example, the company that

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.200
produces furniture has two production.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.440
One of them is in the area

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.920
of own buildings, which

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.460
once bought owners.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.380
And the second production, it is essentially

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.800
similarly located in a small town

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.260
30 kilometers from Kolceva,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.240
where the same is about the

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.360
area of the angar, but it is rented.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.440
We rent it, it is not in the

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.420
property, and there with the rent everything

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.320
is quite clear.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.420
It is included in the report of profits

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.920
and losses as costs, in the

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.660
report of cash flow as payment.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.320
But let's go back to the first

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.460
hangar that is owned by the company.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.140
The company's financial director

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.420
believes that for this hangar,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.800
which is owned by the company,

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.060
it is necessary to consider

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.640
the so-called implicit lease.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.980
The amount we would have paid if

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.900
this property had not been in

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.040
our possession.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.740
On such canons is based management

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.180
accounting, stating that

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.440
if we do, we do not deceive

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.220
ourselves.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.700
After all, we can do this

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.840
to the hiring management that

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.300
in this hangar If this hiring

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.060
management is motivated by

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.040
profit on that hangar, it would

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.480
be logical to calculate

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.160
that profit so that it

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.780
is less.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.120
Put them in the profit and loss

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.480
report this most implicit lease,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.780
because at any time the

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.940
owners can say, “Boys, we

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.340
take this hangar, we need it for

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.700
other purposes, and you will

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.880
have to continue to produce the

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.680
chairs, but already in the

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.820
rented hangar, so be ready

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.160
for this right now.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.220
The so-called implicit rental is

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.560
a very popular article on cost

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.080
in management accounting.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.540
There is no such article in the tax.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.820
Or, if we talk about the

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.920
so-called management balance.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.060
It can hang something intangible,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.520
it can be our software product

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520
or our website or our brand

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.440
or some built in the

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.340
company management

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.360
systems or customer

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.660
base.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.200
In general, this is all not to be felt, and

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.860
to the fact that it is not to be felt,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.080
tax accounting is traditionally treated

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.040
very conservatively, not including it

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.340
in the balance sheet.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.700
And in management accounting, no

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.140
one forbids us to do so if we

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.180
believe that it is actually

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.080
our assets.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.740
We approximately know how much they

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.400
cost, and accordingly they can hang

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.780
in the management balance sheet,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.480
it's again a blue area.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.760
I think there is a red

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.140
area in many companies,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.260
not in all, but some

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.480
companies do.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.220
Red area is those objects that hang

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.000
exclusively in accounting,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.680
in tax accounting, which fall

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.680
into external reporting,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.320
which is sent to external users

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.260
of the state, but which does not

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.000
fall into the triangle

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.480
of management accounting.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.500
I think that this can include,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.820
for example, hopeless debit debt,

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.460
which we in the management accounting

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.300
can hang for a while, because

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.560
the legislation does not

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.320
allow us to forget this,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.900
not to remove from the

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.660
balance sheet.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.420
As for the black region, there are

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.020
the same objects, but not the fact

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.480
that the shameful interpretation

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.260
of these objects in the two triangles

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.700
is the same.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.820
For example, there may be

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.600
some computer that is in the tax

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.240
accounting for the state hanging

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.640
at one price at the moment,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.800
because it is depreciated

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.880
there for quite many years.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.300
And in management accounting, we

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.340
have differently constructed

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.640
the depreciation policy, so the computer

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.840
will hang for a specific moment

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.420
at a different price in the management

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.280
balance sheet.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.100
It is the same computer.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.800
Or a board in the warehouse, the

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.660
pine is on the warehouse of the board,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.620
which we use to make an example

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.120
of a window.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.020
There is a high probability that

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.440
the same board in these two accounts

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.280
will hang at a different price,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.860
because in the tax account we hanged

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.040
it at the purchase price,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.740
and in the management at the

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.560
purchase price plus the

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.020
regular logistics costs that

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.380
we regularly leave at the customs

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.580
and transportation that we carry

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.820
out to bring this board

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.860
to the warehouse.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.260
Irregular things, extraordinary fines,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.180
they may not fall together with this

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.520
board into the balance sheet, but relate

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.660
to the expenses of the period.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.460
But regular logistics costs can be

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.040
hanged together with the price of the

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.360
purchase of the board in the balance

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.120
sheet in the management accounting.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.020
The consumption rates of the board

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.100
may differ in two accounts.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.180
In tax accounting, we use norms

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.140
officially approved, written

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.880
with that calculation, to pay

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.760
as little tax as possible.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.500
And in management accounting,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.000
we can have a much stricter consumption

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.520
of the board, we are guided

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.900
by them to evaluate the

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.560
board in management accounting.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.740
The third point is why the board can

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.380
hang at different prices.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.160
The so-called unfacted deliveries

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.640
are resources that are in our

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.460
warehouse, but for which we

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.780
do not have all the necessary

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.480
documents to get it into the

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.120
tax account.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.640
Usually, there are strict requirements

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.140
in the tax accounting, according

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.200
to which next to the board must

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.700
be a paper on which 14 seals and

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.140
8 signatures stand, and only after

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.540
that the accountant can hang it in

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.020
the balance sheet.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.580
In management accounting, the principle

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.380
of priority of the substance over

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.240
the form works, the substance

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.840
is more important than the form, if

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.780
the board is physically, but not all

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.920
the papers necessary to hang it

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.160
in balance, it must still

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.400
be in the management balance.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.640
The fourth reason why the same

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.000
board can hang in two accounts at

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.020
different prices is the loss

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.500
of that board part or fully useful

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.620
properties in the process

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.340
of storage.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.020
The board stored in the warehouse

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.680
can bleed and deform during storage.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.600
And it is not the fact that

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.700
we can make it the windows

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.760
we wanted to make.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.280
Therefore, part of the boards can

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.020
be valued in the management accounting

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.600
during the inventory and can be

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.420
recorded not at the purchase

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.540
price, but at the price of possible implementation,

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.940
which may be lower than the

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.400
price at which they were purchased.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.640
That is, the board, it is in the black

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.460
field, it hangs in both accounts,

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.960
just in one, in the green tax account

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.640
it hangs at one price at the moment,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.040
and in the management

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.080
account at another.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.340
Next, in addition to the

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.860
management tax accounting, on this

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.620
slide they are painted in green

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.300
and grey, the company has

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.840
a third account, the so-called

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.540
financial, yellow color

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.600
is marked.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.920
This accounting is usually conducted

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.380
by companies according to the

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.680
requirements of the International

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.260
Financial Reporting Standards

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.380
(IFRS), this accounting is usually

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.800
conducted in order to be able

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.460
to take not very from 2001-2005

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.360
in Europe a mandatory requirement

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.320
for public companies, that

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.740
is, for companies that have

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.040
shares circulating on the

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.680
stock markets, is the reporting

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.860
of IFRS, according to international

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.600
financial reporting

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.660
standards.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.400
Banks have recently made

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.460
such demands.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.120
If you want cheap money, please make

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.860
a balance sheet of the profit

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.480
and loss report and the cash

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.600
flow report, in accordance

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.620
with the requirements of IFRS,

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.520
International Financial Reporting

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.700
Standards.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.980
Accordingly, the company

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.500
has another headache, and

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.000
the need to do a third account,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.360
which has some area of intersection

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.940
with both tax and management.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.860


00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.120
As a rule, financial and managerial

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.560
are quite close, but the concepts

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.600
of "exchange costs" or "conditional

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.260
rental" in financial

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.600
accounting may not be fixed.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.660
This is a specificity of

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.800
management accounting.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460
Therefore, I cannot say that financial

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.460
and management accounts are completely

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.360
matched.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.580
All three accounts have a balance

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.260
sheet of the profit and loss

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.880
report and a cash flow report, but

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.900
the figures in these three documents

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.960
may not coincide at any time

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.880
or for a certain period.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.120
Because of the so-called accounting

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.420
policies.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.920
Accounting policies are rules, principles,

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.760
canons, which we consecrately observe

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.820
in order to obtain certain

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.200
figures in the reports at the

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.840
output.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.260
And since the rules in the three accounts

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.040
can be different, the numbers can

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.760
also be different.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.420
The next moment.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.840
We have already said that

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.900
using only financial economic

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.980
information, i.e. the balance

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.740
sheet, the report on profits

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.180
and losses and the report

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.400
on cash flow is not enough,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.360
because this information

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.200
is usually delayed and

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.120
does not reflect all

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.400
the problems and achievements

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.380
of the business.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.160
We will, of course, get the

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.180
financial indicators from

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.360
the management accounting, but most

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.540
likely the company will

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.680
have to build a wider

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.860
triangle, which you see on this

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.260
slide.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.140
It is called a management

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.640
information system.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.120
That is, management accounting

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.840
is a part of a more global management

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.040
information system, which

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.720
in addition to financial figures

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.460
obtained from management

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.680
accounting, also includes

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.980
not financial figures,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.360
not financial indicators.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.540


00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.540
To build this system is very convenient

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.300
to use the method that was

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.980
proposed by Robert Kaplan, an American.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.260
This method is called a balanced scorecard.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.060
In Russian translated as a balanced

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.920
system of indicators, within

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.260
this methodology we develop

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.520
a system of financial and economic

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.540
indicators, that is,

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.840
the final indicators of

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.900
our business, this is profit,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.040
profit on invested capital,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.640
cash flow, revenue, business

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.400
value, what pops up on

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.740
the surface in the

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.420
iceberg, at the top, at

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.080
the tip.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.420
If we go down below, we will need

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.180
indicators that inform us

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.200
about the satisfaction

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.120
of our customers' loyalty, this

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.500
can be the index of customer

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.460
approval, the number of complaints,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.320
the volume of re-sales.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.160
The volume of re-sales is a figure

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.060
obtained from management

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.380
accounting, that is, the information

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.600
is value.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.620
But the number of complaints and

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.100
the index of customer approval is not

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.580
valuable information, it hangs on the

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.760
balance sheet.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.860
It is part of a wider triangle.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.640
Going even deeper, we move to the

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.440
Business Process section, where

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.840
we monitor each process in our

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.220
business through the cost and

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.680
quality time triangle.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.220
The cost of the process is again

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.500
information valuable.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.960
Again, we take it from

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.240
the management account, how much

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.540
is blown into each process.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.680
But the time of the process, as

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.120
well as the quality of each process,

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.320
is not valuable information, it

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.520
is necessary with a broader pyramid.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.860
Approaching the very foundation,

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.800
we work in the project of the infrastructure

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.520
staff, trying to measure the

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.220
state of our staff and infrastructure.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.500
Personnel, if measured, you

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.500
can use value indicators, average

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.120
wage per company compared

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.540
to market, or the index of

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.460
outstanding personnel,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.640
flow of personnel, average ballt

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.620
by professional certification

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.540
results, these are

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.620
all non-value indicators

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.900
that we get from a wider

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.420
pyramid.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.820
As for infrastructure, this

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.840
can be the degree of

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.260
capacity depletion, the state

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.500
of the software product

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.240
hardware, the state of our

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.460
buildings, which we use to

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.020
perform certain processes.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.200
In general, we need a fairly

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.720
broad, comprehensive management

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.660
information system, in which

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.700
we consider both financial and

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.420
non-financial indicators.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.380
A small example on this subject.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.500
The company has a network

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.820
of own stores where it

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.320
sells clothes and shoes.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.740
The management information system in

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.140
the company is built on the logic

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.580
of the balance sheet scorecard,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.820
on the logic of balanced you

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.040
can see on this slide.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.980
In this system, everything

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.260
starts with a goal, and the indicators

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.860
we use to monitor our business

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.340
are largely dependent on

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.760
what goals we set for

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.840
the business.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.260
Let's say that a business has

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.060
a goal like increasing profits.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.740
A standard target for any

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.500
company.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.340
The company uses the net profit

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.700
indicator.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.060
We see that it comes from the

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.660
management accounting system, and

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.200
the periodicity of monitoring values is quarterly.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.760
The second goal, also quite

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.360
typical for many companies, is

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.160
to increase customer satisfaction.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.640
It is monitored through two

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.200
indicators, it is the customer

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.740
satisfaction index and the number of

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.260
complaints of positive feedback

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.300
from customers.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.160
Customer satisfaction index is calculated

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.580
on the basis of customer surveys

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.040
in stores, customers are given a

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.760
questionnaire on a 10-point scale and

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.100
the company asks, dear customers,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.460
give us a score on a 10-point scale

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.180
here is this, give us a score

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.640
for this, give us a score for

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.900
this and for this.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.700
In the latest survey, evaluate us

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.860
against our competitors.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.120
If you go to our competitors sometimes,

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.280
how do we look at our

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.040
competitors?

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.040
Give us a ball for that.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.640
Draw the points you bet

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.080
on our competitors.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.880
To the satisfaction of customers.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.300
This is a number on a scale from 1 to 10.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.140
The company does this once every six months.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.760
The second indicator for this purpose

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.180
is the number of complaints

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.940
or positive feedback from customers

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.020
who come to the stores.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.540
There is a book of reviews in the store, and

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.880
you can get it from there without any problems.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.600
Once a month, the company does.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.580
The next goal is to increase the

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.180
efficiency of the work of the stores,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.380
monitor the number of violations

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.060
of the corporate standard

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.780
of the work of the store.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.200
The company has such a thick booklet,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.920
called "Standard of the store work",

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.580
in which everything is described

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.160
in very detail, up to the appearance

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.660
of the sellers, on the eighth

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.200
page detailed the jewelry of

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.420
the seller's nails.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.080
This is verified by the Secret

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.240
Buyer system.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.700
There is such a method

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.840
of "Mr. Shopping", when a sent-in cosacks

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.120
comes to the store and records

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.320
a violation of the standard of

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.040
work in the store.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.180
They will be whatever.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.400
The standard can be written that

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.060
it is strictly forbidden to proceed

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.400
with the cleaning of the store until

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.140
the last customer has left it.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.020
If the store is open until 22:00 and at 21.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.160
59 the customer has entered the store, then

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.560
the faces of the sellers should not

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.620
be crushed, checks will be made.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.840
They are strictly forbidden

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.460
to start cleaning the store until the

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.680
customer has left it.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.220
All this can be checked by

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.420
ministry shopping, secret buyers,

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.120
components are made once every six

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.580
months.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.600
We go down.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.620
The goal for personnel is to improve

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.160
the qualification of staff, a fairly

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.480
standard goal and to increase

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.060
the satisfaction of staff.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.080
Here we use the following relative

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.340
qualification indicators

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.640
average score by results, accordingly,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.160
the certification procedure

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.980
once every six months.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.960
To measure the satisfaction

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.320
of the staff, we

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.360
use two values.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.880
Again, the satisfaction index through

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.280
the request, through the questionnaire once

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.120
every six months and the indicator

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.480
of staff flow.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.320
It is obtained from the so-called process

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.880
accounting journal, the source of

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.840
information, also the half-year indicator.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.660
In this slide we see that management

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.340
accounting as a system of information

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.860
collection of all

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.880
information needs of

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.900
management to meet is not able.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.060
That is, it is a rather narrow

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.180
triangle, from which we take

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.240
profit, costs, revenue, assets,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.320
liabilities, equity, money

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.740
movement, the profitability

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.300
of imposed capital.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.720
In general, what can be taken from

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.360
the balance sheet is a report on profits

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.480
and losses and a report on cash flow.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.220
But the manager needs additional,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.500
non-value information that

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.700
we can take from customer surveys

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.780
or staff surveys, from the secret

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.860
buyer system, the certification

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.880
system, and so on.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.180
So, we said that companies that operate

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.060
in the capital market will

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.900
have three accounts.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.840
One for the state, one for itself

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.580
and one for the capital market, it

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.680
is usually called financial

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.040
accounting, we conduct it in accordance

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.360
with the requirements of international

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.600
financial reporting standards,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.560
which are developed by the

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.160
committee located in the

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.480
city of London.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.090


00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.710
We can compare these three triangles

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.510
by a fairly long list of criteria

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.490
and come to the conclusion that

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.250
everything is very different.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:18.850
These are different goals,

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.950
different users, different objects, and so on.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.570
Let us go through each aspect,

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.590
discussing what will be in these

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:30.970
cells here, here and here.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:34.630
If we compare these three accounts with

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.310
respect to the purposes for which we keep

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.990
them.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.250
Tax accounting we usually keep in order

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.810
not to be closed as a business,

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.050
this is a mandatory requirement.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.850
The state in any country in the world

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.030
wants to know something about business,

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.250
writes regulations that our accountant

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.750
must observe, entering the

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.470
so-called tax accounting.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.430
The main purpose of financial accounting,

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.570
which we conduct in accordance with the

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.350
requirements of IFRS, the committee

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.630
is located in the City of London, is

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.450
the desire to obtain cheap money in

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.830
the capital market.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.970
The main goal of introducing

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.090
management accounting is to understand

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.230
what is actually happening in the

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.190
business, and we are developing

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.070
these rules for ourselves.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.290
A lot of good things can be taken

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.030
from here.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:29.110
Of the IFRS standards, many companies

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.610
simply read the IFRS booklet in

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.430
order to take quotes from there

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.830
and insert it into the management

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.390
accounting policy.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.130
It is a very good foundation, a very

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.770
good foundation.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.770
It needs to be finalised, of course,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.530
to adapt to your business, but in principle,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.910
a book on international standards

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.270
on your reporting is a very good

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.530
basis for describing the

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.710
accounting policy of management

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.730
accounting.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.270
The main purpose of this accounting

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.830
is to obtain money in the external

00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:00.650
environment, either in the loan

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.810
market or in the equity market.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.070
The main purpose of management accounting

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.890
is to understand what is happening

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:08.770
in the company.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.030
Users can differ, here users

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.150
are the state, here users

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.430
are investors, potential or active,

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.340
and this is the management of

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.250
the company, top management,

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.690
mid-management, line management,

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.710
in general, employees

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.870
of the company, who to some

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.890
extent want to understand

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:29.090
what is happening

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.110
in their business and

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.190
make some management decisions.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.250
The third aspect is the objects of accounting.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.670
In a large cage, the objects are the same.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.550
In all three accounts there are

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.330
such concepts as assets, liabilities

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.630
and equity.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.750
That is what hangs in balance.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:49.350
In all three accounts there are income, expenses,

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.730
and profits.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.930
This is what hangs in the profit

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:52.950
and loss report.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.490
And in all three accounts there

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.950
are incomes, payments and the difference

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.370
between them cash flow.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.510
This is due to the account

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.850
of cash movement.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.610
But it is in a large cage, in a smaller

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.030
there are nuances.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.870
I have already said that in management

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.370
accounting there is such a thing

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.050
as an implicit cost.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.590
For example, this is a virtual rental.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.390
or in many companies like to calculate

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.250
the salary of the founder,

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.210
that is, the founder should

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.710
not work, he gave money and expects

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.570
some percentage on the invested

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:24.530
capital.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.150
If he also comes to the office occasionally

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.610
and helps the hiring management

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:29.870
to develop, for example, a

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.390
business strategy, he is not obliged

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.110
to do so.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.690
What happens in the management accounting?

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.890
In management accounting,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.010
it is charged, not necessarily

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.490
paid, but the wage is charged,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.610
which in the report on profits and

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.910
losses reduces the profit from

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.970
which motivates the hiring

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.110
management.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.650
How much do we charge salary?

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.230
About the amount that would be

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.810
paid to an employed person, a

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.310
consulate company, in this market,

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.290
where we operate at some average

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.030
market price, we consider the

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.490
salary in the stock.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.670
This is called an inexplicable cost.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.710
Assets as an object of accounting.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.410
In recent years, a lot has been

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.430
said about the knowledge economy, the

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.890
importance of intangible assets for

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.830
business.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.570
There are many companies in which

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.830
almost all assets are intangible.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:25.290
Well, imagine an IT company, in this business,

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.890
in addition to desks and computers,

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.050
we have more brains.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.030
It is very difficult to hang 3-4 tons of brains

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.810
in balance.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.410
All major assets are essentially

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.990
leaving their jobs at

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.530
6 p.m.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.150
If tomorrow morning at 9 am they do not

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.150
appear at work, then the company manager,

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.830
except for the back tables and back

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.890
computers in the office, has nothing

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:48.630
left.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.770
But it is very difficult to hang the

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:52.450
brains in balance, these are intangible

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.030
assets, human competences, skills,

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.590
know-how.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.750
But this is an important issue,

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.590
and the management accounting is trying to

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:01.630
solve it too.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.670
It is clear that some

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.410
intangible assets can hang

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.810
a little in tax accounting,

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.350
can hang a little in financial,

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.450
but in the management list

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.130
of intangible assets can

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.130
be much wider.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.510
So in a large cell the list of objects

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.930
of accounting coincides, and in a small

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.630
one - not.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.130
Principles of accounting.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.250
The principles of accounting in tax accounting

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.710
are prescribed in numerous regulatory

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.030
acts.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.130
Financial Accounting is the International

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.310
Financial Reporting

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.410
Standard.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.810
In the management accounting is written

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.130
the so-called accounting policy.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.150
We have already said that international

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.590
standards can serve as a very

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.730
good basis for writing management

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.170
accounting policies, but these

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:50.290
principles and rules may

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:51.810
differ slightly.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.750
When we talk about the balance of management,

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.150
for example, we will say that.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.090
If the principles and rules

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.150
for accounting debt in these

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.910
three accounts differ, the

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.070
figure of debt will also

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.790
differ.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.250
If the principles of the accounting

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.230
rules of the assets in all three

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.150
accounts may differ slightly, then

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.390
the figures in all three accounts

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.330
will differ.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.510
One well-known German automobile

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.630
company has profits in two

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:28.810
accounts, according to German

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.510
national standards, and

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.010
in the U.S. standards.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.030


00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.270
The GAAP was different in 1992

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.450
by 1 billion then-German marks,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:43.110
as I know, because the principles

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.490
and rules of calculating

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.630
profits in the two accounts differed.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.350
The same company with the same equipment,

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.470
with the same people, with stock

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.870
of finished products

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.350
in stock and so on.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.410
The cost assessment of the work

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:57.690
was different.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:59.590
In one account the profit X, in another account

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.190
the profit Y, and the profit delta

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.750
of a billion marks.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.390
This is well-known by the American

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.550
financier Alfa Rapaport.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.050
He said that profit is opinion, cash

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.330
is fact, profit is opinion, money

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.890
is fact, having in mind that the

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.310
principles of calculating

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.750
cash flow in all three accounts

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.130
are the same.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.710
Money came for bills to the cash, got

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.190
money from the billing account and the

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.430
cash, it is very difficult to chemise.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.950
And in principle, the distinction of

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.430
cash flow in the white company in

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.190
all three accounts should coincide.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.410
But profit is not a fact, because the principles

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.050
of the rule of calculation of profit here

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:37.990
are one, here are others, here is a third.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.210
With one reserve, you can

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.490
come up with a lot, and only because

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.470
of the reserves, the profit in

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.210
all three accounts can differ.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.230
The second reason is, for example, amortization.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.450
In one account we amortise

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.590
the building for x years, in another

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.230
in the third Z years, and, accordingly,

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.670
the profit went to one account,

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.970
in another another, in the third third.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.830
Accuracy and speed are the following

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.590
criteria.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:06.590
I will probably start

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.610
with management accounting, with an

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:13.530
example of an international company

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.190
and a description of how the financial

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.530
and economic information flows

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:18.770
in that company.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.950
This international company has a representative

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.490
office in Kiev, and this representative

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.690
office is dropping its figures

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:27.810
to Berlin.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.730
In Berlin, consolidation is

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.710
being carried out in Germany and throughout

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.850
Eastern Europe.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.530
After that, Berlin drops information

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.350
to Paris, where its headquarters is

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:41.130
located for Europe, and in Paris,

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.710
consolidation is carried out across

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.410
Europe.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.010
After that, the numbers are thrown across

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.370
the ocean to the city of New York, where

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:50.610
the company's headquarters is located,

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.470
where all the streams are aiming.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.470
In New York, the authors of the

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.310
management accounting and reporting

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:03.210
policy wrote the number 5 and rounded

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.070
it into a frame.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.610
This means that the figures for February

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.990
2008 in New York should be on the

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.010
table on March 5.

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.550
Berlin, the intermediate link in

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.070
the chain for the Kievans, for the Kiev

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.330
colleagues who throw information

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.030
to Berlin, wrote the number 2 and wrapped

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.330
it into a frame.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.410
The figures about how Kiev worked

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:27.770
out should be in Berlin to the

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.910
second number, so that Berlin

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.430
could reduce everything in

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:33.750
Germany, in Eastern Europe, process,

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.390
send to Paris, and then it will

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.610
go to New York to the fifth

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.870
number.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.610
Accordingly, no matter how quickly Kiev

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.150
knocked on the keyboard with the

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:42.430
fingers, it physically has no opportunity

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.130
to send simultaneously accurate and

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.290
operational information to the second

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:47.870
number.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.630
Therefore, the management

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.110
report that leaves Kiev to

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.830
Berlin contains a very large

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.670
percentage of the case fact.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.750
But in New York, they decided that

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.170
approximate information about the fifth

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.770
number is more important to us than absolute

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:05.390
accuracy about the twenty-fifth.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.430
Absolute accuracy then reaches the

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.990
25-26th when it puts the known final,

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.530
but approximate fact, the example

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.270
fact should be to the fifth number,

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.930
and this is the specificity

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.850
of management accounting.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:21.190
Often, speed is more important than accuracy.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.410
Precision will be later, it will be,

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.790
it will be, but speed is sometimes more

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:26.810
important.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.450
As for detail.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.310
As a rule, management accounting is the

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.710
most detailed of all three, and tax

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.510
and financial in large part interests

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.270
us business as a whole, and in management

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.330
accounting we are interested not

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.690
only business as a whole, but

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.610
also pieces of business.

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:46.090
It could be a product portfolio.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.110
In management accounting, you can

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.450
be interested in the structure of

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:52.790
revenue on products, on customers, on

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.150
sales channels, on sales markets, on

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.810
sales department employees.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.250
Maybe a lot of cuts.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.090
We may be interested in the management

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.270
accounting of the debiot's

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.290
position, very detailed.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.310
Debit liabilities are in the balance sheet

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.530
and in the management accounting.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:14.110
In addition, this total number

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.970
is accompanied by a long

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.410
large plate that details

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.790
who owes us, when to give,

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:24.690
what percentage of hopeless

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.270
or questionable debt.

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.690
In management accounting there

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.390
is a phenomenon, as centers of financial

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.830
responsibility, these are structural

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:34.930
units of business.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:35.910
We are trying to assess

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:36.950
the economic efficiency of

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.150
each of them.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.870
In general, management accounting is the

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.690
most detailed system of the three.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.830
The currency.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.670
As for currency, we need to talk about

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.730
the currency of the operational

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:53.090
daily accounting and the currency

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.190
of the reporting.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:57.590
Reporting is usually a product

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.510
for a long period, six months

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.530
or a year.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.810
The currency of the annual report and the currency

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.350
of the operational accounting may not coincide.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.750
Typically, the currency used as

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.330
the currency in which the company carries

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.490
out most of its operations is used

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.590
as the currency of operational accounting.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:14.850
If most transactions are in

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:16.530
rubles, the currency of accounting

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:17.730
will be rubles.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.370
It is less time-consuming than every

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.710
day to convert everything into some

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.450
other currency, such as the euro

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.670
or the US dollar.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.510
But the currency of reporting for

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:27.990
a long period may be different.

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.410
Let's look at one example in

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.690
the next slide.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.690
This slide shows the dynamics of the profit

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:38.950
of the same company for the period of

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:45.710
99 and 2007 in three different currencies.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:47.670
Let's say that one currency is the ruble,

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.190
one currency is the dollar, one

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.550
currency is the euro.

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.490
I will not specify what color

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.890
each currency, in principle,

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.090
can be guessed.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.790
You can see

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.710
that in 2007, the profit in green currency

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.890
was just fine, the profit in red

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:09.370
currency was very bad, and the

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:10.850
profit, if you count it

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:14.430
in blue currency, was average.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:19.310
The company wants to have a sufficiently

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:23.450
solid money sign in which it could

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.870
inform its managers or shareholders

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.690
about profitability over a long

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.710
period of time, for example from

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.090
99 to 2007, well and finds a very

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:35.910
interesting solution to make a basket,

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.090
such a conditional money sign,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.810
an artificial poppy consisting

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.690
of three currencies at the

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.890
same time, in the image

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.070
and likeness of the euro, the euro

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.630
is in principle also a basket

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.150
that at one time was formed from

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.030
the German brand, the French

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.710
"Franco", the Italian "Lira",

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.250
the Spanish "Piseto" and so on.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:58.670
The question of weight.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.890
The company decided that 0.3-0.3-0.4 will

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.550
be the weight of each currency, and that

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.730
basket will be rubles, euros and dollars.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.590
This currency can be called anyway,

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.430
but usually companies take the first

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.390
three letters from their own and get

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.610
the name of the currency.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.450
It is artificial.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.430
As an option, the basket can

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.550
consist of four currencies.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.770
For example, the dollar, the

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:35.910
euro, the Swiss franc and the English pound.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:37.950
Swiss franc, English pound -

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.330
quite stable currencies,

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.710
they can add to our artificial

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:52.770
Something similar does

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:54.670
companies that make

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.890
management reports

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.990
not in cash, but in natural

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.090
units.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:03.330
The most exotic currency

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.050
of management reporting I've

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.550
ever encountered is called

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.510
the Dalmatian pup.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.410
The company's shareholders asked

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.570
the financial director to draw up

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:15.470
the board's accounts in the

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:20.150
Dalmatian puppies, moving the

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.790
usual money stamps into this

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.670
artificial equivalent.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.550
Why the Dalmatian puppies?

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.710
I have a suspicion that shareholders

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.310
just love this breed, although I am willing

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.410
to argue about the feasibility

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:34.150
of using this currency because the

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.390
fashion of the breed can change,

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.710
and accordingly the price

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.330
of the breed depends somewhat on

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.470
the fashion, and therefore it may

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.110
not be a very successful equivalent.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:50.630
But students traditionally converted

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:53.030
their scholarships into liters of

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:56.690
vodka and liters of beer, assessing

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.050
their purchasing power.

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:59.430
In principle, the company can also

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.730
convert its profit, revenue in square

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.030
meters of housing, in glasses of beer

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:06.670
"Ginness", in puppies

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:13.130
"Dalmatian" or in for the profit

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.110
earned in 2001 and for the profit

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:16.870
earned in 2006.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.050
I hope that the idea with these

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.270
artificial currencies is understandable

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:24.410
to you and in principle quite

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.230
simple here.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.130
We are trying to come up

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.750
with some stable, stable equivalence

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.950
enough to compare our 2007

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.770
profit to the 2000

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.730
profit.

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:37.110
This is the specificity of management accounting.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.030
These kinds of games with currencies

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.190
can be here.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.010
A few words about currency

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:44.890
and management reports again.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.330
There is a person who is thinking

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.030
about the feasibility of entering

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.790
an MBA program in one business school.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.650
He had this idea in 2001

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.130
when it cost $7,000 at

00:54:57.130 --> 00:55:00.390
this business school.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:02.930
But he eventually went on an MBA

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.390
in 2007 and paid $17,000 for

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.310
his studies.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.730
It's about the same program,

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:09.070
the same subjects, the same speakers,

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:11.490
well there they've been 6 years

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.330
old, but in principle it'

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:14.770
s the same program.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.530
And this person claims that in this business

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.010
school the MBE program has not been expensive,

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.850
but has been lower.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:23.470
He explains this in the following way.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.810
He says that in 2001, business

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:29.030
school employees, having sold

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:30.870
the MBE program for 7,000, could

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:34.270
go to the Irish Pub and drink

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:38.270
5 full glasses of delicious

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.750
Guinness beer at 0.5.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.270
And in 2007, the same people,

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.550
going to the same Irish Pub, selling

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.390
their MBA for $17,000, could afford

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:52.130
to drink 4 full-fledged glasses

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.910
of Guinness beer and a small

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.410
glass of 0.25, but not more.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.670
And so, if you evaluate in the

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.510
Guinness, the MBA is cheaper.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.550
In macroeconomics, there is the

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:09.930
Big Mac index, which informs us

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.410
about how much Big Mac can eat on

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.070
their wages Hungarians, Italians,

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.950
Finns, Japanese, Venezuelans,

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.310
and so on.

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.490
Something similar we see in trying

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:23.070
or trying to use Dalmatian

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:25.810
puppies as currency and

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.530
management reporting.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.730
The next criterion by which we can compare

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:31.490
the Three Accounts is the account

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:32.950
plan.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.050
You probably know that in 1494,

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.990
an Italian monk, his name was Luca

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:43.210
Pacholi, invented a system

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.290
of double recording.

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:47.870
The system of accounts, called the

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:49.270
double record system.

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.710
That is, if you explain it in a simple

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:53.890
example, in a monastery can be stored

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:55.410
in a warehouse honey.

00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.350
In the beginning of February there

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.930
were so many liters of honey, during

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:06.130
February we bought or obtained some

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.050
amount of honey, during February

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.190
some amount of honey, so to

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.810
speak, consumed or sold, and finally

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:14.010
in February some residues remain.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:18.510
The honey that comes

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:20.170
out of one account

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.510
on which it was

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:26.610
accounted, it

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:28.330
goes to another

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.910
account, that

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:32.290
is, in the

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.650
system itself

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.130
is placed.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:37.650
These accounts are usually

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:40.090
held in a certain accounting system.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:43.050
It can be a single system for all of

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:43.770
this accounting.

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.870
This is the first scenario.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.030
The second scenario, when we

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.370
tax accounting in one account system,

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:49.410
and in the management,

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:52.130
we create our separate account system

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:53.750
and it is by it we will talk about the

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:57.870
pros and cons of both approaches,

00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:59.770
it is only important to understand

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:02.950
that the plan of accounts can also differ.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.790
The pre-last moment is the

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:06.670
people we attract for this

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.390
job, for this job, for this job.

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:09.910
Theoretically, it could be the same

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.890
person or the same group of people

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.830
who handle all three accounts,

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.170
familiar with all three accounting

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.570
policymakers.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:21.330
And these accounting policies can be

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:23.810
different, but it is difficult to

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:24.910
find such people, they are very

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:26.470
expensive.

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:27.970
Accordingly, the second option, one group of

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:30.070
employees in our company is dealing with

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:32.390
this consideration, the other with this,

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:33.570
the third with this.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.790
As an option, one group is this, and

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:38.410
the other is these two, because they

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.090
are very similar.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.310
It also costs some money to the

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.650
employer, but here you have to consider, a cleaning-out.

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.450
But it is very important to understand

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.610
that it is very rare to find a person

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:52.570
who for reasonable money agrees

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.450
to make three accounts and not to

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:56.390
make a mistake in three accounts,

00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.370
because the way of thinking is different,

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.230
canons, principles can vary quite seriously.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.750
Therefore, the most common option,

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.930
when we have a group of specialists,

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:09.010
fully concentrated

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.310
on this accounting system,

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:14.210
they do not have to switch

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:16.350
the rubber in the head

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.270
to engage in these accounts.

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:19.930
For these purposes, there is another

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.510
group of employees who specialize

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.930
in this and who do

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:23.710
it well.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.350
I would like to emphasize that there

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:26.630
are companies where the same people

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.370
keep three accounts, but still most

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.410
companies choose the second scenario,

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:33.090
individual people for tax, individual

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:34.830
people for financial management.

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.970
The last point is the assessment criteria.

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:40.810
We are primarily interested in

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:44.110
the criteria by which we will

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:45.130
put our management accounting

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:47.030
a unit or a tenth on a 10-

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.050
point scale.

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.430
Management accounting on the 10th

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:52.630
on a 10-point scale is accurate,

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.790
prompt, detailed, confidential,

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:59.570
and a very important point

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:01.370
is readability.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.410
This moment is sometimes underestimated, but

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.230
it is a very important moment.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:10.210
It's not just beauty, it's marketing

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.170
in the field of

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.830
management accounting that

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:16.150
makes information pleasant

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:19.690
for end users to perceive.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.910
The list of evaluation criteria

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.470
in management accounting consists

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:28.050
of the following points: speed,

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.510
accuracy, detail, confidentiality

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.550
and readability.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.660
The standard question, where

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.280
to start the creation of management

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.420
accounting and management

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.020
reporting system in the company.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.420
My experience allows me to argue that

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.920
we should start with drawing a list

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.900
of our processes, an image of

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.500
our business in the form of a set of

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.100
interrelated processes.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.480
They can be 10-15, so that you don'

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.720
t get lost in the debris.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.780
And after we have developed

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.200
a list of the main processes

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.360
of our business, we must identify

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.100
the key control indicators

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.280
for each process, observing

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.320
which we will understand in what

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.700
state our process is at the

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.400
moment.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.580
The logic here is quite simple.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.520
For each process, we can

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.960
hang a triangle cost and quality

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.220
time, estimating how much we have

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:46.020
spent on resources to complete

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.320
the process, how fast or

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.240
on time it is performed and

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.100
what are the quality characteristics

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.560
of this process.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.960
If you draw a general scheme,

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.200
for a certain conditional company

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.940
you can identify the process

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.620
of design, procurement,

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.920
production, promotion, branding,

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.760
distribution, service

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:09.640
process.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.460
These processes, which are highlighted

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.780
in the grey color of this slide,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.360
can be considered primary,

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.700
directly forming some

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.480
value for a certain target

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.800
group of customers.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.700
Or are serving secondary

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.000
auxiliary processes

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.460
that help these primary

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.640
value creates.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.400
For example, human resources management

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.340
as a process, the financial

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.860
management system itself in the business,

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.520
IT control, legal support

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.160
of the business and so on.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.380
Yellow processes, cross-sectional, carrying

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.380
a service character.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.220
In this slide you see an example of a

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.840
company working in the fashion industry.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.880
The company produces shoes.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.060
The business has six main processes,

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.560
and for each process a minimum

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.920
set of three key indicators

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.100
is selected in accordance with

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.420
the logic of cost time

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:09.240
quality.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.520
The constructive process.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.400
In addition to knowing how much we'

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.860
re boiling in design in total or

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.260
percentage of revenue, we monitor

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.040
the speed of new product development,

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.460
as well as how quickly the

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.660
design service creates

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.480
new products.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.280
Well, the quality of

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.540
the design service can be shown

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.660
by the percentage of developments

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.400
introduced into production,

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.260
not just in the trash, but how

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.740
much of the total amount

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.680
of design service

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.480
products was able to implement

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.960
into production and then sell.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.680
The Procurement Process.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.540
Again we know how much we have been

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.320
into this process by article and

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.580
by listing all the costs.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.300
We know how fast the process

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.800
is done, using the indicator

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.660
of simple in production due to the

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.580
lack of the necessary resources.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.520
Well, an indicator of quality in this

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.380
process can be an entry marriage.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.840
The production process is monitored

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.440
again through at least three indicators,

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.540
namely, production costs.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.840
All the costs that arise

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.240
in production, we list

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.260
and fold the column here.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.420
The time of the process can be monitored

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.580
through indicators, the average

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.960
time of execution of orders, additional

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.660
indicators that inform us about

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.260
what is happening in production,

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.420
can be the share of marriage

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.320
and productivity

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.240
of the work of the

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.360
production staff, the same output.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.060
In terms of promotion and branding.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.540
You can calculate how much is spent

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.420
on this matter, and use the percentage

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.940
indicators of our brand recognition.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.600


01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.960
Indicators of time, timing, probably,

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.120
in this process are not as important

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.560
as in other processes.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.040
So is there a sketch here regarding

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.460
the sales process?

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.020
In addition to costs, we monitor

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.400
the turnover of the debt and

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.580
the number of violations

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.060
of standards in the sales sector.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.780
The company has its own wholesale and

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.100
retail, as far as retail is concerned,

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.700
there is an indicator of the number

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.100
of violations of corporate

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.420
standards in stores.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.380
As for the wholesale, the

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.600
fate of the wholesale here is more

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.680
important than misunderstanding

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.460
of corporate standards.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.940
As for the service?

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.060
In addition to the cost of service, the

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.300
company monitors the speed of elimination

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.920
of problems arising from customers, how

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.340
quickly we solve problems arising

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.720
from customers, and the marriage

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.980
that can arise in the process of elimination

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.240
of problems, this is also

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.000
an indicator that interests us.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.800
Thus, the management accounting

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.980
and reporting system starts

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.160
with the elaboration of a list

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.520
of key business processes

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.640
and the elaboration of a list

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.160
of key indicators for each

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.920
process.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.880
In addition to the key indicators

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.900
that we monitor, we also receive

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.280
the so-called management

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.300
reporting on the table.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.200
The minimum set of documents in

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.500
the management reporting system

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.200
is called the management

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.340
balance sheet.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.400
At the beginning and end of the

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.620
period, the so-called report on

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.000
profits and losses in the management

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.100
APAG and the management report

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.400
on cash flow.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.840
In this slide we see the logic of the

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.680
connection between these documents.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.940
If the company has worked out for a period

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.680
with a red profit, the amount

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.780
of this profit increases the size

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.860
of the company's own capital

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.100
and, accordingly, the amount of assets.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.020
The report on profits and losses

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.340
in management accounting is usually

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.820
made according to the so-called principle

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.860
of accrual.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.700
That is, revenue from shipping, and costs

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.640
on the fact of consumption of the

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.380
resource, not at the time of payment for

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.560
these consumed resources.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.240
But how the company moved money,

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.800
this is seen in the third

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.060
document, in the report on the

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.980
cash flow, which can be done

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.880
by two methods, direct and indirect.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.200
Here is a straight line, when we know the

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.340
balance of money at the beginning of the

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.300
period, we know how much money the

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.700
company came over that period and how

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.920
many days did not go.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.000
We finally form the

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:19.900
rest.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.620
The minimum set of management

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.620
reports is the balance sheet

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:25.140
of the profit and loss

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.220
report, the report of

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.020
cash flow.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.360
We prepare the same documents in

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.900
tax and financial accounting, but

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.480
the figures, we said, in balance

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.900
sheets, in profit and loss reports

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.020
and in cash flow reports

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.540
may differ because the accounting

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.440
policy is different.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.780
Management accounting contains a

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.720
long list of additional reports

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.200
as an appendix to the balance sheet

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.540
of the profit and loss report of the

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.240
money flow report.

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.600
These can be sales reports,

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.100
debit and accreditorship

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.440
reports, and stock

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.380
reports.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.540
These are additional large reports

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.520
that contain detailed information

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.980
about the figure that will be

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.440
hanging in the balance sheet or

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.100
in the profit and loss report.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.560
You have in the documentation

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.900
an example of a management report

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.660
of one construction company, in which

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.120
you can see the entire list of

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.380
indicators of reports that

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.960
come to different users with different

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.980
frequencies.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.260
The logic is quite simple.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.520
The company first developed

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.140
a system of indicators for the

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.140
top manager daily, weekly,

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.220
monthly, and those he receives

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.720
every six months, and then approved

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.900
a list of indicators for

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.440
second-level managers - the

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.040
financial director, commercial

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.200
director, chief engineer,

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.460
and so on.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.500
It is the same logic that they need

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.460
every day, what they need every week,

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.920
what they need every month, and what

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.220
they need every six months.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.680
In addition to financial reports - this

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.020
is the balance of the report on profits

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.060
and losses, the report on

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.740
money movement with applications,

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:11.060
debitors, lenders, stocks, sales - we

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.240
and non-value reports, for example,

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.100
in the construction business,

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.600
the acts of the works performed - this

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.040
is quite common management information,

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.520
but not valuable.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.680
Moving on the schedule or not, this

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.140
is seen in a separate report,

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.640
which is part of the management

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.800
reporting package.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.200
Please look at this example

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.940
in your context and I think

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.700
you can use it as a basis

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.720
for writing a key indicators

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.620
and reporting system

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.380
for your company.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.980
It is important to understand

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.740
the user circle – what report

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.800
indicators the CEO needs

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.880
every day, every week, every

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.160
month and every six months,

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.140
and what report indicators second-

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.580
level managers need.

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.640
Again, every day, every week, every

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.520
month and once every six months,

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.280
once a year.
